00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
up to do this we find how much we

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.760 
up to do this we find how much we
produce<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.560> car

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
and to get the space for the place we

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.500 
and to get the space for the place we
have<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.490> work<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.940> booty<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.330> make<00:02:29.480> a

with<00:03:11.239> some<00:03:11.390> suspension<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:12.709> we<00:03:12.799> have<00:03:12.920> a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
with some suspension and then we have a

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.490 
with some suspension and then we have a
new<00:03:13.160> shops<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.390> shops<00:03:14.720> from<00:03:14.959> someone

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
new shops that shops from someone

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.860 
new shops that shops from someone
special<00:03:15.709> made<00:03:15.950> for<00:03:16.100> us<00:03:16.190> from<00:03:16.400> Coney<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.239> we

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
special made for us from Coney and we

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.660 
special made for us from Coney and we
also<00:03:18.019> change<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> pump<00:03:18.709> stops<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.250> because

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
also change the pump stops on it because

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.940 
also change the pump stops on it because
of<00:03:19.850> when<00:03:20.600> you're<00:03:20.720> driving<00:03:20.930> often<00:03:21.350> we<00:03:21.739> want<00:03:21.860> to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
of when you're driving often we want to

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.800 
of when you're driving often we want to
have<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> software<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.819> bigger<00:03:23.120> transcription

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
have a software and bigger transcription

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.770 
have a software and bigger transcription
take<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.260> pumps<00:03:24.590> better<00:03:25.269> that's<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.540> reason

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
take the pumps better that's the reason

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.900 
take the pumps better that's the reason
we've<00:03:27.470> certainly<00:03:27.980> seen<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.549> action<00:03:28.819> I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
we've certainly seen that in action I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.400 
we've certainly seen that in action I
could<00:03:29.060> tell<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.420> think<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.900> think<00:03:30.170> my<00:03:30.260> back

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
could tell you I think I think my back

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.330 
could tell you I think I think my back
is<00:03:30.440> going<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.769> be<00:03:30.829> a<00:03:30.890> little<00:03:31.040> bit<00:03:31.190> better

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
is going to be a little bit better

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.800 
is going to be a little bit better
because<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:32.209> having<00:03:32.390> that

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
because of that so having that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.660 
because of that so having that
that's<00:03:33.079> quite<00:03:33.290> appreciated<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:34.160> little<00:03:34.549> bit

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
that's quite appreciated a little bit

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.830 
that's quite appreciated a little bit
about<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.970> wheels<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.359> tire

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
about the wheels in the tire

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.310 
about the wheels in the tire
the<00:03:36.320> wheels<00:03:36.799> are<00:03:37.040> ten<00:03:37.609> inch<00:03:37.820> wide<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.299> 17<00:03:39.170> inch

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
the wheels are ten inch wide and 17 inch

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.740 
the wheels are ten inch wide and 17 inch
is<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.920> special<00:03:40.340> made<00:03:40.430> for<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:40.820> offset<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.390> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
is a special made for this offset of the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.370 
is a special made for this offset of the
also<00:03:42.620> done<00:03:42.739> in<00:03:42.829> special<00:03:43.100> metros<00:03:43.459> because<00:03:44.150> of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
also done in special metros because of

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.750 
also done in special metros because of
the<00:03:45.380> multiplication<00:03:45.709> we<00:03:46.070> don't<00:03:46.340> want<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.609> go

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
the multiplication we don't want to go

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.819 
the multiplication we don't want to go
too<00:03:47.090> much<00:03:47.120> out<00:03:47.570> and<00:03:48.079> we<00:03:48.380> have<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.739> it

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
too much out and we have to have it

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.170 
too much out and we have to have it
exactly<00:03:49.190> right<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.640> have<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.880> turning

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
exactly right so you have the turning

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.480 
exactly right so you have the turning
radius<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.290> same

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
radius of the same

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.520 
radius of the same
and<00:03:53.500> we<00:03:54.500> use<00:03:55.190> cemeteries<00:03:56.000> because<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.350> have

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
and we use cemeteries because you have

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.410 
and we use cemeteries because you have
more<00:03:57.800> rubber<00:03:58.040> in<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.850> Thai<00:03:59.000> if<00:03:59.060> we<00:03:59.240> can

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
more rubber in the Thai if we can

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.900 
more rubber in the Thai if we can
deflate<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.960> tire<00:04:00.140> easier<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:01.460> drive<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.820> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
deflate the tire easier to drive in the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.570 
deflate the tire easier to drive in the
Sun<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.590> that's<00:04:03.590> helped<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.100> lot<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.980> then<00:04:07.100> at

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
Sun and that's helped a lot and then at

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.240 
Sun and that's helped a lot and then at
the<00:04:07.730> same<00:04:07.760> time<00:04:07.940> when<00:04:08.360> we<00:04:08.680> modify<00:04:09.680> like<00:04:10.130> in

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
the same time when we modify like in

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.650 
the same time when we modify like in
rear<00:04:10.460> we<00:04:10.670> have<00:04:10.820> to<00:04:10.910> open<00:04:11.180> up<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.360> wheelers<00:04:11.630> and

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
rear we have to open up the wheelers and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.780 
rear we have to open up the wheelers and
move<00:04:11.930> around<00:04:12.350> in<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:12.890> rear<00:04:13.010> life<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.580> cropped

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
move around in the rear life in cropped

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.410 
move around in the rear life in cropped
and<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:15.320> get<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:15.560> place<00:04:15.770> for<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.040> tires<00:04:16.420> so

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
and to get this place for the tires so

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.320 
and to get this place for the tires so
we<00:04:17.720> are<00:04:17.840> cutting<00:04:18.050> from<00:04:18.710> 6<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.489> 11<00:04:19.610> centimetres

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
we are cutting from 6 to 11 centimetres

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.450 
we are cutting from 6 to 11 centimetres
in<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.600> 40<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.380> much<00:04:21.620> more<00:04:21.650> work<00:04:22.160> and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
in the 40 so it's much more work and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.180 
in the 40 so it's much more work and
this<00:04:22.880> looks<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.330> business<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.770> not<00:04:24.920> just

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
this looks like business it's not just

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.680 
this looks like business it's not just

this compliment it's a bit more than
just<00:04:35.660> taking<00:04:35.840> some<00:04:36.050> big<00:04:36.200> wheels<00:04:36.320> on<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.890> thing

normal<00:05:49.099> Land<00:05:49.280> Cruiser<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:50.169> think<00:05:51.169> physically

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
normal Land Cruiser I think physically

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.589 
normal Land Cruiser I think physically
the<00:05:51.680> main<00:05:51.860> difference<00:05:52.250> is<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.610> I<00:05:52.879> simply

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
the main difference is that I simply

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:54.760 
the main difference is that I simply
feel<00:05:53.750> like<00:05:53.930> I'm<00:05:54.020> sitting<00:05:54.229> much<00:05:54.409> higher<00:05:54.650> in
