Hello and welcome!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
today I show you the Hangover 2 Steelbook

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Exclusive to Amazon.de

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
limited Steelbook Edition

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
inclusive postcards-set with 6 motives

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the sticker that says, there is a digital copy

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the front cover looks really cool

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the steelbook is shiny

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the canadian steelbook looks the same, except for the title

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because the canadian title is Hangover Part II

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I like the german title, just Hangover 2

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
spine

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
backside

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
backpaper

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Specials of Blu-Ray

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Languages

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
okay let's open it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the backpaper is glued on the steelbook

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:23.000
sony has the 2 stickers, that holds the backpaper

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that's how the Steelbook looks like, without the backpaper

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
looks really nice!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
very shiny

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
if you look at the steelbook, I think the monkey is at the front

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and the background is in the back, it's really hard to describe in english :P

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
spine

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
backside

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
awesome back!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
blu-ray

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
rating logos = german &amp; dutsch

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
so the dutch blu-ray should have german language

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the cover looks nice, back &amp; white

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
here are the artcards

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the Digital Copy

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
let's take a look at the inside artwork

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
complete overview

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I really like it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:52.000
ok, here are the 6 artcards

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the backside is just white and the credits....

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
ok that were the artcards

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
6 artcards total

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they aren't glossy, just a mat printing

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I really like the artcards 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
ok that was the Hangover 2 Steelbook

00:03:37.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but let me give you again a quick overview

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I hope you liked it and see you next time ;) !!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
