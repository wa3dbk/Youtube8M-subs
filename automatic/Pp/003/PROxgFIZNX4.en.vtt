stuff like that and I like that but it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
stuff like that and I like that but it
worked<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.340> slow<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> GPS

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
worked really really slow and the GPS

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510

never really updated that well and
places<00:01:30.000> directory<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> much<00:01:31.229> much

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
places directory I think is a much much

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
places directory I think is a much much
better<00:01:31.770> job<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.400> doing<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.299> plus<00:01:33.540> there's<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
better job of doing this plus there's a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
better job of doing this plus there's a
little<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.110> options<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.640> places

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
little more options you can do so places

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.399 
little more options you can do so places
