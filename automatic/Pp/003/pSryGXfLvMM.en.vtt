00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.050 
purple side and the puff is very easy to
find<00:02:56.330> because<00:02:56.630> we<00:02:56.900> came<00:02:57.110> with<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> hair<00:02:57.650> pin<00:02:58.060> so

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
find because we came with a hair pin so

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.670 
find because we came with a hair pin so
you<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.360> have<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.930> look<00:03:00.080> for<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.380> hair<00:03:00.500> pin

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
you just have to look for the hair pin

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.180 
you just have to look for the hair pin
and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.070> take<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.340> out<00:03:01.520> when<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.850> find<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
and then take it out when you find the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:14.790 
and then take it out when you find the
pot

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.380 

so<00:03:15.800> this<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.310> other<00:03:16.550> side<00:03:16.850> run<00:03:17.120> I'm<00:03:17.240> going

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
so this is the other side run I'm going

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:41.100 
so this is the other side run I'm going
to<00:03:17.480> remove<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.020> hair<00:03:18.200> pin<00:03:22.090> back<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.390> European

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:53.140

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.240 
that's the part the hump on the side is
even<00:03:53.330> way<00:03:53.959> bigger<00:03:54.350> because<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.800> we<00:03:54.920> got<00:03:55.069> Mina

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
even way bigger because the we got Mina

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.820

lying on the other side for so long that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.699 
lying on the other side for so long that
there<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.550> hump<00:03:58.940> at<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.390> top<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.530> will
