00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
guys like my little baby guide to like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.760 
guys like my little baby guide to like
making<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.060> guess<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.229> if<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.619> dry

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
making this I guess so if you have dry

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.250 
making this I guess so if you have dry
skin<00:02:03.799> olive<00:02:04.640> oil<00:02:04.790> helps<00:02:05.119> because<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.930> might

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
skin olive oil helps because it might

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.560 
skin olive oil helps because it might
Rises<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:06.830> hydrates<00:02:07.310> your<00:02:07.460> skin<00:02:07.520> however<00:02:08.360> it

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
Rises and hydrates your skin however it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.330 
Rises and hydrates your skin however it
isn't<00:02:08.810> oil<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.710> have<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.040> really

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
isn't oil so if you have like really

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.980 
isn't oil so if you have like really
really<00:02:10.460> acne<00:02:10.880> prone<00:02:11.060> skin<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.510> might<00:02:11.630> not<00:02:11.840> be

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
really acne prone skin it might not be

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.780 
really acne prone skin it might not be
the<00:02:12.110> best<00:02:12.260> idea<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.070> oily<00:02:13.370> skin<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.640> can

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the best idea so for oily skin you can

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.250 
the best idea so for oily skin you can
also<00:02:13.910> increase<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.360> amount<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.750> women<00:02:15.140> you

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
also increase the amount of women you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.220 
also increase the amount of women you
add<00:02:15.440> because<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.640> reduces<00:02:17.060> extra<00:02:17.540> oils<00:02:17.900> if<00:02:18.080> you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
add because it reduces extra oils if you

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.780 
add because it reduces extra oils if you
follow<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.590> exactly<00:02:19.040> measurements<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.670> this

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
follow the exactly measurements of this

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.000 
follow the exactly measurements of this
and<00:02:19.940> stuff<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:20.930> gonna<00:02:21.080> make<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.410> more<00:02:21.560> watery

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
and stuff it's gonna make it more watery

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.310 
and stuff it's gonna make it more watery
consistency<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.360> was<00:02:23.660> personally<00:02:24.020> trying

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
consistency so I was personally trying

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.410 
consistency so I was personally trying
to<00:02:24.560> mimic<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.340> scrub<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:26.030> had<00:02:26.210> on<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
to mimic the scrub that they had on the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.720 
to mimic the scrub that they had on the
lush<00:02:26.660> website<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.410> added<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.070> bit<00:02:28.220> more<00:02:28.280> sea

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
lush website so I added a bit more sea

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.360 
lush website so I added a bit more sea
salt<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.180> mine<00:02:29.480> because<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.680> does<00:02:30.890> make<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.250> a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
salt in mine because this does make it a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.490 
salt in mine because this does make it a
bit<00:02:31.580> like<00:02:31.880> more<00:02:32.270> runny<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.260> like

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
bit like more runny if you have like

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.050 
bit like more runny if you have like
sensitive<00:02:33.890> skin<00:02:34.130> though<00:02:34.250> that's<00:02:34.760> gonna<00:02:34.910> be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
sensitive skin though that's gonna be

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.190 
sensitive skin though that's gonna be
really<00:02:35.270> great<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.140> not

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
really great for you because it's not

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.410 
really great for you because it's not
gonna<00:02:36.440> be<00:02:36.620> as<00:02:36.800> tough<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.370> your<00:02:37.640> face<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.300> could

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
gonna be as tough on your face you could

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.720 
gonna be as tough on your face you could
also<00:02:38.570> use<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.810> damp<00:02:39.110> washcloth<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:40.190> help<00:02:40.460> with

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
also use a damp washcloth to help with

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.460 
also use a damp washcloth to help with
this<00:02:40.910> too<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.810> have<00:02:41.960> sensitive<00:02:42.410> skin

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
this too if you have sensitive skin

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.380 
this too if you have sensitive skin
because<00:02:43.160> that's<00:02:43.430> gonna<00:02:43.580> help<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.150> break

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
because that's gonna help to like break

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.450 
because that's gonna help to like break
down<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.780> crystals<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.500> they're<00:02:45.710> not<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.190> as

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
down the crystals so they're not like as

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.340 
down the crystals so they're not like as
harsh<00:02:47.090> on<00:02:47.360> your<00:02:47.510> face<00:02:47.750> while<00:02:48.020> still

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
harsh on your face while still

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.440 
harsh on your face while still
exfoliating<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.460> don't<00:02:49.790> believe<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.240> has

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
exfoliating so I don't believe this has

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.240 
exfoliating so I don't believe this has
to<00:02:50.630> be<00:02:50.750> refrigerated<00:02:51.050> because<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
to be refrigerated because of the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.700 
to be refrigerated because of the
antibacterial<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:53.380> ingredients<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:54.500> used

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
antibacterial like ingredients we used

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.170 
antibacterial like ingredients we used
and<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.100> however<00:02:55.610> it's<00:02:55.820> pretty<00:02:55.970> much

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
and it however it's pretty much

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.060 
and it however it's pretty much
inevitable<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.960> like<00:02:57.290> bacteria<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.890> gonna

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
inevitable that like bacteria is gonna

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.890 
inevitable that like bacteria is gonna
grow<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.700> pretty<00:02:58.940> much<00:02:59.090> everything<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.690> if

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
grow and pretty much everything so if

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.060 
grow and pretty much everything so if
you<00:02:59.990> would<00:03:00.110> like<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.410> slow<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.800> rate<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you would like to slow that rate you

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.580 
you would like to slow that rate you
could<00:03:01.310> also<00:03:01.490> refrigerate<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.390> don't<00:03:03.200> think

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
could also refrigerate it I don't think

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.110 
could also refrigerate it I don't think
it<00:03:03.740> requires<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.490> lush<00:03:04.670> website

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
it requires that on the lush website

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.760 
it requires that on the lush website
though<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.810> don't<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.170> this<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:06.590> does

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
though and I don't think this one does

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.220 
though and I don't think this one does
either<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.640> that's<00:03:07.910> about<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.780> tips<00:03:09.050> I

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
either so that's about all the tips I

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.860 
either so that's about all the tips I
have<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.740> did<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> lot<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.280> research<00:03:10.640> for<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:11.000> so

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
have I did a lot of research for this so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.330
