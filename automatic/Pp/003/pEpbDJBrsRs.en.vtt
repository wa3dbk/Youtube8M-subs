00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello friends this time I'm going to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.490
 teach how to do velvet manicure 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.790
 velvet what we are going to need is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 a basis that in this case exists prime 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.590
 a top coat the color of preference in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 I'm going to use a red color and 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.939
 For the main thing is the powder of 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.829
 velvet velvet and a cotton swab for 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:38.239
 clean up let's start laying the foundation 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.239
 in all the nails 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 i 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.420
 all right 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.440
 well we wait here to dry the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.390
 base 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.390
 to then put the color 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.690
 once it was already filtered we are going to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.690
 start putting the color 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.060
 We already know how to do all this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 very easy once we already put in 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 all the nails we are going to wait for 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.710
 Dry the color so after this put 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.710
 the top coat 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 It is very important that we put the same 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.620
 color of enamel 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.950
 and the velvet so you do not stay 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.780
 so it does not look ugly 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.500
 Well let's wait for the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.890
 colour 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.850
 once the polish is dry we go to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.850
 put the top coat 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.190
 let's put it ready in quantity 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.110
 generous 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.110
 sticking to it well 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.580
 the velvet once we put it 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.760
 let's put 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.510
 I'm going to put a little leaf 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.940
 to pick it up then let's put the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.900
 finger 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.900
 in the little boat 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.560
 and we are going to tap so that 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.560
 stick 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.130
 if they do not lack spaces because what 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.130
 they put back 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:26.290
 and finally with the cotonete we are going to 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.290
 clean and we will shape the nail 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.599
 in this way 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.740
 and so we have our fingernail to see the 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.870
 difference with normal enamel and with 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.920
 the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.200
 the velvet is very easy to 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.200
 of doing this manicure
