let's say like here's like the ipod
touch<00:00:49.860> 2nd<00:00:50.129> generation<00:00:50.480> now<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.410> has

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
touch 2nd generation now if it also has

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590 
touch 2nd generation now if it also has
one<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> these<00:00:53.010> poems<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.789> life<00:00:53.969> exploits

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
one of these poems for life exploits

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.689 
one of these poems for life exploits
we're<00:00:54.840> basically<00:00:55.199> no<00:00:55.920> matter<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.340> Apple

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
we're basically no matter what Apple

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760 
we're basically no matter what Apple
does<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.390> always<00:00:57.570> jailbreak<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> ipod

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
does I can always jailbreak this ipod

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
does I can always jailbreak this ipod
it's<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> same<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.180> once<00:01:00.480> they

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's going to be the same way once they

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
it's going to be the same way once they
finish<00:01:01.350> developing<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.489> gonna<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
finish developing it it's gonna be the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.830 
finish developing it it's gonna be the
same<00:01:02.940> way<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> iphone<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.850> ipad<00:01:05.850> ipod

same way for the iphone for ipad ipod
touch<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.500> basically<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> jailbreak

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
touch going to be basically a jailbreak

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.399 
touch going to be basically a jailbreak
for<00:01:08.820> everything<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> no<00:01:09.780> matter<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.020> Apple

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
does they can't really patch it because

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
does they can't really patch it because
it's<00:01:12.210> hardware-based<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> course<00:01:13.920> they

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's hardware-based now of course they

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.859 
it's hardware-based now of course they
can<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.790> ahead<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.000> fix<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.659> new

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
can go ahead and fix it with new

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
can go ahead and fix it with new
hardware<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.830> assuming<00:01:17.100> you've<00:01:17.250> already

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
hardware but assuming you've already

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
hardware but assuming you've already
bought<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.850> ipod<00:01:18.119> touch<00:01:18.299> 4th<00:01:18.570> generation<00:01:18.810> or

something<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
something like that you're going to be

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.420 
something like that you're going to be
good<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:22.140> guys<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.530> far<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
good to go so guys as far as when we can

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.249 
good to go so guys as far as when we can
expect<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.030> jailbreak<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.659> don't

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
expect to see this jailbreak I don't

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
expect to see this jailbreak I don't
think<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.740> long<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.159> fact

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
think it's going to be long in fact

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
think it's going to be long in fact

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
that apple TV you know it's a lot

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.710 
that apple TV you know it's a lot
different<00:02:42.400> from<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.820> know<00:02:42.850> hacking<00:02:43.120> an<00:02:43.360> iPod

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
different from you know hacking an iPod

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.990 
different from you know hacking an iPod
or<00:02:43.750> an<00:02:44.050> iPhone<00:02:44.170> however<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.430> will<00:02:45.580> be<00:02:45.760> able<00:02:45.850> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
or an iPhone however it will be able to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.520 
or an iPhone however it will be able to
be<00:02:46.090> jailbroken<00:02:46.120> as<00:02:46.720> well<00:02:46.900> which<00:02:47.110> i<00:02:47.260> think<00:02:47.320> is

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
be jailbroken as well which i think is

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.500 
be jailbroken as well which i think is
pretty<00:02:47.860> cool<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.820> know<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.150> expect

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
pretty cool so you know you can expect

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
pretty cool so you know you can expect
to<00:02:49.600> go<00:02:49.690> ahead<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:49.990> see<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> lot<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.410> different

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
to go ahead and see a lot of different

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.760 
to go ahead and see a lot of different
things<00:02:50.740> perhaps<00:02:51.220> even<00:02:51.460> app<00:02:51.790> support

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
things perhaps even app support

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.350 
things perhaps even app support
obviously<00:02:53.770> not<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.070> know<00:02:54.190> normal<00:02:54.850> ass<00:02:55.030> but

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
obviously not you know normal ass but

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.670 
obviously not you know normal ass but

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
you will probably be able to see quite a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080 
you will probably be able to see quite a
few<00:02:56.740> really<00:02:57.130> interesting<00:02:57.550> things<00:02:57.580> for<00:02:58.030> the
