00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
of code that's caused the problem we can

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.100 
of code that's caused the problem we can
now<00:01:20.500> see<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.800> it's<00:01:21.160> mike<00:01:21.970> pulteney<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.630> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
to choose the jab I just actually um

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.900 
to choose the jab I just actually um
I'll<00:01:35.140> just<00:01:35.410> turn<00:01:35.619> up<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:36.009> volume<00:01:36.759> here
