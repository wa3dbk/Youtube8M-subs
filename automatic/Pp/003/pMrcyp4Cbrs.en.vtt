00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
card it and i've already taken one of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.740 
card it and i've already taken one of
the<00:00:46.579> brackets<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.329> other<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.660> will

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the brackets off here the other one will

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.529 
the brackets off here the other one will
come<00:00:48.930> off<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.700> screw<00:00:50.700> undo<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
come off with just a screw undo it and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.410 
come off with just a screw undo it and
then<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.940> pieces<00:00:53.940> come<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.539> off

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
then these little pieces come right off

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.490 
then these little pieces come right off
doing<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.510> one<00:00:57.809> hand<00:00:59.809> ok<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.469> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
doing this one hand ok just like that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
doing this one hand ok just like that
and<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.489> reason<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.850> taking<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and the reason we're taking two off is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
and the reason we're taking two off is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to give room for the graphic card to go

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.810 
to give room for the graphic card to go
in<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.990> room<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.710> being<00:01:08.100> connected<00:01:08.640> as

that's supposed to run very quietly so
we'll<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.280> how<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.970> works<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:48.360> does

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
we'll see how that works out and it does

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.139 
we'll see how that works out and it does
come<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:48.979> protective<00:01:49.979> coverings<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.000> the

be<00:01:53.880> popping<00:01:54.060> them<00:01:54.360> off<00:01:54.509> before<00:01:54.689> dropping<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
be popping them off before dropping it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.600 
be popping them off before dropping it
in<00:01:56.000> dropping<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:58.320> Falls<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.369> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
in dropping it in just Falls right in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.389 
in dropping it in just Falls right in
here<00:01:59.939> into<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.630> spot<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> bottom<00:02:02.189> there

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
power supply so I didn't need to use any

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.250 
power supply so I didn't need to use any
modular<00:02:50.760> ones<00:02:50.970> since<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:52.020> were<00:02:52.080> already

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
modular ones since they were already

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.460 
modular ones since they were already
built<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.710> might<00:02:53.220> as<00:02:53.280> well<00:02:53.400> use<00:02:53.610> them<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.030> then

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
built in might as well use them and then

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.230 
built in might as well use them and then
last<00:02:55.470> part<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.010> I'll<00:02:56.070> finish<00:02:56.250> up<00:02:56.490> are<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
last part so I'll finish up are going to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.830 
last part so I'll finish up are going to
be<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.480> connect<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.290> two<00:02:59.390> power<00:03:00.390> connectors

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
be to connect the two power connectors

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.620 
be to connect the two power connectors
for<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.140> motherboard<00:03:01.590> down<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.730> there<00:03:02.970> blue

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
for the motherboard down in there blue

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.810 
for the motherboard down in there blue
area<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.200> one<00:03:04.710> down<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.070> their<00:03:05.190> path<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.610> chip

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
area and one down in their path to chip

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.850 
area and one down in their path to chip
and<00:03:07.490> then<00:03:08.490> I'll<00:03:08.700> oh<00:03:09.380> then<00:03:10.380> I'll<00:03:10.470> connect<00:03:10.770> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
and then I'll oh then I'll connect the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.190 
and then I'll oh then I'll connect the
four<00:03:11.070> fans<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.790> are<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.000> here<00:03:12.150> they<00:03:12.930> need<00:03:13.110> to

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
four fans that are in here they need to

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.810 
four fans that are in here they need to
be<00:03:13.230> connected<00:03:13.530> from<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.400> four<00:03:14.580> fans

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
be connected from the four fans

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.060 
be connected from the four fans
throughout<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> case<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.690> then<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.770> will

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
throughout the case and then I will

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.250 
throughout the case and then I will
close<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.550> case<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.000> wrap<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.300> up<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.140> that's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
close the case and wrap it up so that's

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.110 
close the case and wrap it up so that's
pretty<00:03:19.530> much<00:03:19.709> how<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:19.950> build<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.610> computer

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
pretty much how you build a computer

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.910 
pretty much how you build a computer
from<00:03:21.510> scratch<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.380> parts<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.770> are

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
from scratch with the parts that are

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.560 
from scratch with the parts that are
necessary<00:03:23.010> there<00:03:23.580> are<00:03:23.670> additional<00:03:24.000> parts<00:03:24.450> you

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
necessary there are additional parts you

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.540 
necessary there are additional parts you
can<00:03:24.600> fit<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.560> obviously<00:03:25.709> there's<00:03:26.340> room

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
can fit in here obviously there's room

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.670 
can fit in here obviously there's room
for<00:03:26.810> drives<00:03:27.810> different<00:03:28.260> types<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.440> drives

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
for drives different types of drives

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.350

like the SD card reader I want to get at

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.630 
like the SD card reader I want to get at
some<00:03:30.540> point<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.830> could<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.130> an<00:03:32.220> extra<00:03:32.459> sound

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
some point you could have an extra sound

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.820 
some point you could have an extra sound

card or various other cards you can drop
in<00:03:35.070> down<00:03:35.820> there<00:03:36.090> I'm<00:03:36.300> not<00:03:36.510> using<00:03:36.660> any<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.959> those

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
in down there I'm not using any of those

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.110 
in down there I'm not using any of those
now<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.550> basics<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.030> you

now but this is the basics that you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.970 
now but this is the basics that you
pretty<00:03:39.330> much<00:03:39.420> need<00:03:39.750> once<00:03:40.530> you're<00:03:40.709> done<00:03:40.800> with

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
pretty much need once you're done with

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.860 
pretty much need once you're done with
this<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.430> do<00:03:41.580> need<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.880> install<00:03:42.300> an<00:03:42.630> operating

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
this you do need to install an operating

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.630 
this you do need to install an operating
system<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.770> i'll<00:03:43.860> be<00:03:43.920> putting<00:03:44.160> windows<00:03:44.370> on

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
system on it i'll be putting windows on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.490 
system on it i'll be putting windows on
here<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.570> you'll<00:03:45.720> need<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.870> pick<00:03:46.050> that<00:03:46.230> up<00:03:46.290> as

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
here so you'll need to pick that up as

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.430 
here so you'll need to pick that up as
well<00:03:47.390> ok<00:03:48.390> we're<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.780> last<00:03:48.930> legs<00:03:49.230> now

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
well ok we're on the last legs now

you're<00:06:27.930> using<00:06:28.080> installation<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:28.949> need<00:06:29.099> to<00:06:29.219> do

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
you're using installation and need to do

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.670 
you're using installation and need to do
you<00:06:29.490> and<00:06:29.760> that<00:06:29.790> could<00:06:30.540> also<00:06:30.720> involve<00:06:31.050> loading

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
you and that could also involve loading

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.160 
you and that could also involve loading
drivers<00:06:31.830> from<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:33.060> manufacturers<00:06:33.720> of<00:06:33.780> the

drivers from the manufacturers of the
other<00:06:34.290> parts<00:06:34.680> that<00:06:35.430> you<00:06:35.460> put<00:06:35.670> in<00:06:35.760> the<00:06:35.820> machine

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
other parts that you put in the machine

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.960 
other parts that you put in the machine
and<00:06:36.390> usually<00:06:37.170> they<00:06:37.530> come<00:06:37.560> with<00:06:37.980> discs<00:06:38.880> and

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
and usually they come with discs and

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.130 
and usually they come with discs and
then<00:06:39.090> you<00:06:39.150> can<00:06:39.240> always<00:06:39.420> download<00:06:39.570> updates

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
then you can always download updates

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.050 
then you can always download updates
windows<00:06:40.860> 7<00:06:41.220> should<00:06:41.400> have<00:06:41.550> a<00:06:41.580> bunch<00:06:41.850> of<00:06:41.940> them

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
windows 7 should have a bunch of them

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.810 
windows 7 should have a bunch of them
already<00:06:42.470> packaged<00:06:43.470> with<00:06:43.620> it<00:06:43.800> as<00:06:43.890> well<00:06:44.040> so<00:06:44.310> I

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
already packaged with it as well so I

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.010 
already packaged with it as well so I
would<00:06:44.940> imagine<00:06:45.090> that<00:06:45.300> will<00:06:45.510> go<00:06:45.600> pretty<00:06:45.780> easily

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
would imagine that will go pretty easily

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.140 
would imagine that will go pretty easily
as<00:06:46.320> long<00:06:46.470> as<00:06:46.590> it's<00:06:47.220> smoking<00:06:47.640> it<00:06:47.790> doesn't<00:06:48.090> look

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
as long as it's smoking it doesn't look

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.510 
as long as it's smoking it doesn't look
like<00:06:48.330> it<00:06:48.450> will<00:06:48.570> looks<00:06:49.110> pretty<00:06:49.320> happy<00:06:49.470> I<00:06:49.890> will

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
like it will looks pretty happy I will

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.580 
like it will looks pretty happy I will
along<00:06:50.730> check<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.780> performance<00:06:51.930> of<00:06:52.320> some<00:06:52.500> of

though I'm really happy with how this
worked<00:07:21.150> out<00:07:21.270> I'm<00:07:21.630> happy<00:07:21.870> with<00:07:22.050> the<00:07:22.170> case<00:07:22.380> and

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
worked out I'm happy with the case and

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.840

the<00:07:22.860> other<00:07:22.980> parts<00:07:23.370> that<00:07:23.550> did<00:07:24.390> come<00:07:24.570> together

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
the other parts that did come together

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.010 
the other parts that did come together
there<00:07:26.850> were<00:07:26.940> some<00:07:27.150> curve<00:07:27.330> balls<00:07:27.390> and<00:07:27.810> one<00:07:27.930> of

there were some curve balls and one of
them<00:07:28.110> I<00:07:28.170> still<00:07:28.410> have<00:07:28.500> to<00:07:28.620> deal<00:07:28.770> with<00:07:28.920> which<00:07:29.130> is

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
them I still have to deal with which is

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.460 
them I still have to deal with which is
the<00:07:29.460> case<00:07:29.850> itself<00:07:30.210> and<00:07:30.540> cutting<00:07:30.990> part<00:07:31.260> of<00:07:31.350> the

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
the case itself and cutting part of the

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.410 
the case itself and cutting part of the
holder<00:07:32.250> for<00:07:32.370> the<00:07:32.430> side<00:07:32.640> fan<00:07:32.850> out<00:07:33.090> to<00:07:33.120> make<00:07:33.390> room

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420 
holder for the side fan out to make room

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.940 
holder for the side fan out to make room
for<00:07:33.630> the<00:07:34.560> better<00:07:34.770> ship<00:07:35.580> cooling<00:07:35.970> system<00:07:36.300> i<00:07:36.390> got

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:36.950 
for the better ship cooling system i got

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.760 
for the better ship cooling system i got
then<00:07:37.950> definitely<00:07:38.580> go<00:07:38.730> for<00:07:38.910> it<00:07:39.210> if<00:07:40.140> you're<00:07:40.710> not

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.550 
then definitely go for it if you're not
sure<00:07:41.040> about<00:07:41.310> you<00:07:41.910> know<00:07:42.030> being<00:07:42.300> able<00:07:43.230> to<00:07:43.410> pick

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.570

so<00:07:47.970> much<00:07:48.120> of<00:07:48.240> an<00:07:48.330> issue<00:07:48.420> because<00:07:48.900> you<00:07:49.080> can't

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290 
so much of an issue because you can't

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.240 
so much of an issue because you can't
save<00:07:49.500> a<00:07:49.530> little<00:07:49.680> bit<00:07:49.800> of<00:07:49.890> money<00:07:49.980> doing

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.250 
save a little bit of money doing

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.550 
save a little bit of money doing
yourself<00:07:50.430> then<00:07:51.300> I<00:07:51.330> would<00:07:51.690> recommend<00:07:51.960> buying<00:07:52.320> a

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 
yourself then I would recommend buying a

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.500 
yourself then I would recommend buying a
prebuilt<00:07:52.890> system<00:07:53.340> because<00:07:53.820> this<00:07:53.970> can<00:07:54.180> get<00:07:54.360> you

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510 
prebuilt system because this can get you

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.870 
prebuilt system because this can get you
a<00:07:55.080> little<00:07:55.440> crazy<00:07:55.680> if<00:07:56.070> you're<00:07:56.370> not<00:07:56.460> up<00:07:56.520> for<00:07:56.640> it

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 
a little crazy if you're not up for it

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.580 
a little crazy if you're not up for it
so<00:07:57.360> i<00:07:57.420> hope<00:07:57.600> that<00:07:57.630> gave<00:07:58.110> you<00:07:58.200> an<00:07:58.290> idea<00:07:58.530> of

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:58.590 
so i hope that gave you an idea of

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.170 
so i hope that gave you an idea of
what's<00:07:58.890> involved<00:07:59.160> with<00:07:59.370> billing<00:07:59.670> machine<00:07:59.820> and

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 
what's involved with billing machine and

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.070 
what's involved with billing machine and
good<00:08:00.750> luck<00:08:00.840> with<00:08:01.020> whatever<00:08:01.320> you<00:08:01.590> choose<00:08:01.770> to<00:08:01.830> do
