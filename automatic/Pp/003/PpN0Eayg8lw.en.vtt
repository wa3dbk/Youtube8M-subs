00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.230
 tutorial of minecraft we are going to make a 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.230
 small cabin good good good for 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.239
 this we are going to occupy a little stone a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.509
 little wood that is the color that 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:20.369
 you want and some trunks 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.359
 and of course to make the roof we're going to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.630
 need 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 these good wood slabs let's start 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.949
 let's say that size is not a matter of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.949
 we are going 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:45.309
 10 x 10 ok 2 4 6 8 9 10 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.309
 very good 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 the floor I leave them your choice I'll 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 I will make wood 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.480
 nice me keep on being a little bit 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.480
 plus the rest 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 we do this fast either 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.890
 interactive creative 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 they are very easy to get materials 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.869
 they carry the personal thing that we are going to do 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.570
 more getting the minutes the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.370
 minerals all the materials but for 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.330
 be a tutorial then let's do it 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.330
 is creative 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.270
 our beautiful wood floor 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.570
 now let's do the pillars of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.480
 4 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.330
 and so 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.900
 4 seen 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.900
 12 12 34 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.000
 3. 4 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.159
 And here too 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.819
 3. 4 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:14.980
 ok for the roof I like to do it 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:18.720
 the traditional cottage style place 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.629
 called more than many cabins 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.739
 that yes the only disadvantage to be done 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:31.240
 a small log cabin house 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.830
 forgiveness of log cabin is that 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.630
 how they lend you fire 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.630
 within the scrubbing all your effort 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.819
 and gas 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.819
 all that very well 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.200
 and ready 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.290
 for example of games excel for 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.220
 to see a little more 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.730
 as if they were memories 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.730
 5 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.950
 remains 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.960
 just on this side we do the same 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.860
 and it will be like this 2 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.950
 then we are going to fill in these spaces 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.620
 do not 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.750
 ok this fast 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.740
 we are 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.470
 and so they want to decorate that they cut for 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.530
 do straight with a little bucket of 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.530
 Luminous stone look great 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.320
 with this 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.320
 I missed 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.710
 let's fill in this and it's taking more 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.710
 Horse shape 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.210
 now the only bad thing that I like 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.260
 much this style of house put you 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.420
 chimney 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.260
 always battled a lot 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:48.130
 he has stockings because obviously he turns on 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.230
 the whole house and a block is lit in 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.310
 matter of seconds so that it plasma 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.800
 all 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.380
 here we will make my entrance if they want 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.310
 if we want to be a little prettier 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.310
 more aesthetic 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.669
 we were wooden beams 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.200
 and being a little bit better, that's what we're 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.930
 we can 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.960
 and it looks better 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.290
 it would be a matter of seeing what we are going to 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.290
 add 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.650
 glass 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.329
 much more beautiful 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.390
 here 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.530
 and well we needed 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.320
 let's leave like a kart 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.940
 simulate the tiles 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:38.239
 and they can stand 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.130
 I think there are costs left so that 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.130
 see 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.740
 and since you want to make some 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:56.009
 improvised furniture thousand unknown 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.810
 we can put 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:01.070
 the touches 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.070
 of luminous stone 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:09.080
 to be very nice 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:13.060
 and as I say we can make some 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.060
 new improvised with this 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.820
 as if they were beautiful furniture 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.870
 indoor 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.870
 we see 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.760
 four rest lamps 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.760
 and some pistons 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.060
 and this already simulates a small improvement 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:52.130
 If it were a nice little table 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:56.040
 wood we entered it would be a matter of 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:58.950
 we are here what they like they can do 

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.460
 an equal second floor with this design its 

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:05.610
 bed goes up he was corresponded and good up here 

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.400
 the tutorial on how to make a small 

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.090
 but pretty in caracas 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.090
 see you later
