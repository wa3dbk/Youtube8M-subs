what will they enable us to do new ways
to<00:00:39.710> visualize<00:00:40.339> our<00:00:40.519> work<00:00:41.050> we<00:00:42.050> have<00:00:42.260> an<00:00:42.350> idea

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
to visualize our work we have an idea

new ways to share ideas with each other

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.970 
new ways to share ideas with each other
I<00:00:50.120> think<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.350> put<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> images<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I think I just put the images in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:04.630 
I think I just put the images in
onedrive<00:00:57.800> more<00:00:58.800> immersive<00:00:59.250> ways<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.940> play

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
new ways to teach and learn so put the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
new ways to teach and learn so put the
new<00:01:08.400> trap<00:01:08.730> up<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> place<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.660> old<00:01:09.810> one

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
new trap up in the place of the old one

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.340 
new trap up in the place of the old one
yeah<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.000> tighten<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:15.110> new<00:01:16.110> ways<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
yeah and tighten here new ways to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.860 
yeah and tighten here new ways to
collaborate<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.820> explore<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.390> places<00:01:18.720> we've

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
collaborate and explore the places we've

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.070 
collaborate and explore the places we've
never<00:01:18.900> been<00:01:19.460> look<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.670> formation<00:01:21.090> let's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
never been look at this formation let's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
never been look at this formation let's
take<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> closer<00:01:22.680> look

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.050 

and<00:01:27.869> new<00:01:28.439> ways<00:01:28.679> to<00:01:28.710> create<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.429> things<00:01:29.729> we

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and new ways to create the things we

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.420 
and new ways to create the things we
imagine

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430
