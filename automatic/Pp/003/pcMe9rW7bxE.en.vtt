 Grandeur hcn rde not only learn the obstacle navigation unit 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.240
 Also, 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.119
 I chose it. 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.299
 The difference between electronic it products and meetings 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.089
 Yes. 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.810
 How about a neat case 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.030
 While LG Electronics is a good pdp module, 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 Father in form 

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:30.839
 I feel 12 hours. 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.570
 He will be defeated. 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 Indifference scars are a high-tech it 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.230
 I can do business. 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.160
 In the meantime, the advantages of white in this country are 8 inch ke 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.330
 The general mosquito net self 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.520
 A faster than a came back, and cosmetics development 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.770
 We have some friends now 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.040
 You can see from the blog on the photo and 7 days at the resignation stadium 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.430
 It's only about 40% of what's shown. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 I will show you so much, I will listen to the small, 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.970
 I see that it shows 40% going to the neighborhood. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 One of the things I do not show now is 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 Early on, there are a lot of xfit loops on the three-tiered wall 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.800
 On the move 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.230
 With the attenuation of connecting the cumulative navigation speakers 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.230
 So the sound 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.580
 I removed it so that I could hear it prominently 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.140
 I did. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.890
 Those who work in the future will be asked to value. 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.850
 It is. 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.590
 Perforated 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.829
 Outside by problems 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.110
 External speakers work so well in the future so that it can be better 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.250
 It's going to go on. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.960
 In the case of policy, 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 I'm sorry. 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 You can understand that. 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.290
 We won 5 victories on the ground, winning 300 billion won 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
 I can get it down and I can get it up. 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.230
 Looking at 10 companies. 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.320
 In clothes 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.120
 The book's disappearing. 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.889
 No time machine support 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.549
 Get ready. 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.519

 When you turn off 5 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.669
 When changing oil, the old remote controls 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:23.389
 I will be called the future Kookmin Bank, which comes out of the baby zabad 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.129
 Chicken navigation volume is reduced 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.129
 The government's super-speculative district 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:31.960
 Automatically represented in 1990 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.879
 If you can not come back, raise the volume 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.519
 When it rains, 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.159
 Dismissed 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.209
 It's getting cold. 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.509
 Lowering 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 The consumer enters the bottom 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:47.949
 I came down to the control box. 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.469
 Look at the bottom of here. 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.469
 To go back to the PC 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.099
 There is the ability to re-enroll. 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.450
 uae go down when you try and you can shoot again right away 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.450
 If the reset button is shown as an mmr 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.409
 You can barely see the deterioration with the feature trailer 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.629
 Such a system should be. 10. 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.629
 It's a feature again. 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.950
 Elder egg 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.779
 I'll do it again this time. 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.399
 The UC warranty procedure looks at the 642 navigation, 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:35.519
 When you look at it from the side, 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.219
 To perfection 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.219
 The society will be able to handle the Jin 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.979
 The photographer's mother, but most closely 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.549
 How close do you get to perfection 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.030
 If you point out and see if we are out of place 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.390
 In Chapter 4, which was exhibited at Kimpo city show, 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.239
 Do you believe? 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.239
