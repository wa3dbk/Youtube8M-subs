 min 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 nothing 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 it can not be far 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.300
 I returned home in baja california 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.300
 how to walk along thousands of kilometers of sand 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 in this matter 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 It is an oasis for my heart 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.620
 there are few special places in the world that are heaven for life 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.770
 the resources and shelters attracted living creatures from here and there 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.260
 these places are strange 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.410
 we call them 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.280
 oasis 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.580
 of all of them 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 this is one of the most extraordinary 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 likewise arias 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.079
 this is my home 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:15.099
 It is a warm and dry peninsula of about 1100 km and is surrounded by ocean 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.829
 they're called baja california 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.629
 min 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.949
 my name is exequiel ezcurra 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.919
 I work here as the settler 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.919
 today some naturalist companions and I will take them in our places 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.539
 most precious looking for the answer to a simple question 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.339
 because this land and this Tuesday 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.679
 they created an oasis 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.939
 an answer to this question is what is full of food 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.549
 mercedes warrior studied the whales that are dragged here for 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.549
 feed 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:04.119
 the canteens and feed on the floating marine life called plan 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.699
 if they find me 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.369
 tens of thousands of dolphins are dragged here to feed 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.859
 their highly energetic lives 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.069
 the dolphins track the schools of fish near the surface 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.529
 the birds can fuss from miles in the distance and take part of 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.829
 it 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.389
 the roads continue while they listen to the action under water 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.009
 and I have learned to recognize these cities as individuals through their 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.009
 special brands 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.069
 we study them to see how they live 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.069
 even as very well 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.060
 the sharks and killed him to this help 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.060
 I did not know who really did it 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.289

 the national institute of glass 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.370
 even institutions of this level 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:00.680
 and if they have bodies on this page 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.680
 provide a new life to another 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.800

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.380

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.839

 they come to brazil to reproduce 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.879
 and difficult for the changelings to establish the location of their 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.580
 grandchildren 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.580
