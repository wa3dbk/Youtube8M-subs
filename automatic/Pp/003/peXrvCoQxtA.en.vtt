00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 not infrequently can mods in minecraft 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 cause some problems and eg one 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.120
 minecraft constantly screaming 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.010
 bring 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.110
 but that does not have to be and gives 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.000
 it's the minecraft factory reset program 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 which makes sure you minecraft on 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.750
 practically a kind of back condition 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 by putting it originally 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.320
 downloaded without you being there 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.270
 a lot in the configuration files go 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 need but simply with the help of a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.600
 simple click on a button and for that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 we are on the side too 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 for you in the video description 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 is available and scroll down to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.650
 to downloads under invite us 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 download the real tree here 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.829
 then for a simple click 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 Click on the application 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.989
 To run 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.040
 and now we already have the tool 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 and that is already the whole 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 functional reception 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 because this tool will all versions in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 delete minecraft folder 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.129
 it is everywhere in minecraft folder 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.110
 delete and of course all 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.850
 general fashion style in the mods folder 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 have installed and of course the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.180
 profile that means you have to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.699
 Be aware that this tool 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.410
 all that will be clarified though 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 eurobonds are not affected 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.699
 saves texture packs or even resource 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 accordingly, that remains so 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.880
 Everything received and only what with the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 modifications the possible problems 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.170
 can be canceled for it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.570
 Now click on reset minecraft 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 And here and now, too 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.330
 already reset completed you can now or 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.280
 never minecraft login unloads minecraft 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 according to news and the whole we do 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.820
 Of course, once and open the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.439
 launcher and then we see we are 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 again at the login we have to completely 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.549
 originally log on to minecraft and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 did we see that done at edit 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.540
 incident there's no modified here 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.979
 more profiles and we can simply 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.329
 just press play and then it will 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.259
 minecraft 1.8 for us new 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 downloaded 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.040
 Although this video is not necessarily 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 helpful if you want to progress 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.579
 but minecraft is fixed for that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 certainly some problems that may be 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.180
 with mods could have despite you can 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.189
 but also with another tool 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.790
 easy to install and like that 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.799
 is working 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 that is in the video above right 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.290
 explained or you just look 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.909
 directly below it 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.340
 as it is possible the motto if the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.320
 to install items in just 30 seconds 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.840
 it sounds weird but it is not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.680
 because that really works with the help of one 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.750
 simple tools 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.380
