00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
do a quick comparison of the 2011

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.180 
do a quick comparison of the 2011
MacBook<00:00:07.680> Air<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:09.059> 2013<00:00:09.660> macro<00:00:10.260> care<00:00:10.469> by<00:00:11.010> 4

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
MacBook Air and the 2013 macro care by 4

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.170 
MacBook Air and the 2013 macro care by 4
these<00:00:11.250> are<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> 13<00:00:12.000> inch<00:00:13.790> lower<00:00:14.790> end<00:00:15.059> models

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
these are the 13 inch lower end models

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
these are the 13 inch lower end models
we're<00:00:18.180> gonna<00:00:18.270> start<00:00:18.600> off<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:18.720> doing<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.470> startup

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
we're gonna start off by doing a startup

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.089 
we're gonna start off by doing a startup
test<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.480> what's<00:00:21.689> quicker

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.820 

okay<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.160> straight<00:00:26.699> away<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.410> 2013<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.619> these

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
okay so straight away the 2013 one these

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.590 
okay so straight away the 2013 one these
on<00:00:29.539> or<00:00:30.539> sign<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:30.810> faster<00:00:32.840> yeah<00:00:33.920> look<00:00:34.920> at

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
on or sign up faster yeah look at

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
on or sign up faster yeah look at
already<00:00:36.600> done<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.399> they<00:00:41.399> look<00:00:41.579> quite<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.790> lot

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
already done so they look quite a lot

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.619 
already done so they look quite a lot
quicker<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:44.270> there<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> go

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
quicker really and there you go

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
quicker really and there you go
both<00:00:45.960> done<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.760> there's<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
both done so then you know there's not a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.760 
both done so then you know there's not a
great<00:00:48.809> deal<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.079> difference<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.260> yeah

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.740 

that's<00:00:55.770> mainly<00:00:56.370> down<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> SSDs<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:59.750> 2013

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that's mainly down to the SSDs the 2013

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.950 
that's mainly down to the SSDs the 2013
one<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.530> faster<00:01:01.739> SSD<00:01:02.719> I'm<00:01:03.719> going

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
one has got a much faster SSD I'm going

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
one has got a much faster SSD I'm going
to<00:01:04.080> start<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.780> black<00:01:06.780> black<00:01:07.350> magic<00:01:07.799> speed<00:01:08.130> test

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to start a black black magic speed test

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.050 
to start a black black magic speed test
on<00:01:08.909> both<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> them<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> turn<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> brightness

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
on both of them and turn the brightness

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
on both of them and turn the brightness
up<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.950> now<00:01:16.950> start<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
up so you can see now start with the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.350 
up so you can see now start with the
2011<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.979> okay<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.670> two

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
2011 one okay so you get about two

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.999 
2011 one okay so you get about two
hundred<00:01:21.420> thirty<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:22.590> hundred<00:01:22.619> forty

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
hundred thirty two hundred forty

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.660 
hundred thirty two hundred forty
megabytes<00:01:23.310> second<00:01:24.210> write<00:01:24.479> speed<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
megabytes second write speed and the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.020 
megabytes second write speed and the
read<00:01:26.909> speed<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:28.070> 260<00:01:29.070> possibly<00:01:30.229> yeah<00:01:31.259> okay<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
read speed is 260 possibly yeah okay so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.340 
read speed is 260 possibly yeah okay so
263<00:01:33.030> 262<00:01:33.900> round<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.740> okay<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.700> start<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
263 262 round there okay let's start the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.810 
263 262 round there okay let's start the
2013<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> shred<00:01:39.840> away<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.340> lot

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
2013 one and shred away it's a lot

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
2013 one and shred away it's a lot
faster<00:01:42.380> 240<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.560> 440<00:01:44.460> sorry<00:01:44.930> right<00:01:45.930> speed<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
faster 240 or 440 sorry right speed and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.859 
faster 240 or 440 sorry right speed and
then<00:01:46.799> reach<00:01:47.700> me<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> where<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> shoots<00:01:48.630> up

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
then reach me this is where it shoots up

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.950 
then reach me this is where it shoots up
to<00:01:50.329> 725<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> yeah<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.450> 2013<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.689> quicker

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
to 725 so yeah the 2013 much quicker

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.889 
to 725 so yeah the 2013 much quicker
they're<00:01:56.450> now<00:01:57.450> aspects<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:59.899> 2013

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.210 
faster internet connection I go to 11 AC
and<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:21.600> 2001<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.319> has<00:03:22.470> 802<00:03:22.889> 11<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:25.220> that's

watching see you later ok I thought I'd

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.259

just<00:03:34.230> do<00:03:34.380> one<00:03:34.590> more<00:03:34.739> test<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.819> quick<00:03:36.030> test

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
just do one more test it's a quick test

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.129 
just do one more test it's a quick test
of<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:36.540> graphics<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> I've<00:03:39.329> made<00:03:39.540> all<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
of the graphics so I've made all I

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.780 
of the graphics so I've made all I
thought<00:03:40.410> I'd<00:03:40.530> test<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:40.859> minecraft<00:03:41.400> because

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
thought I'd test it on minecraft because

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.490 
thought I'd test it on minecraft because
you<00:03:42.269> know<00:03:42.620> everyone<00:03:43.620> not<00:03:43.769> minecraft<00:03:45.500> we've

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
you know everyone not minecraft we've

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.449 
you know everyone not minecraft we've
got<00:03:46.799> I've<00:03:47.639> made<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> new<00:03:48.150> world<00:03:48.470> both<00:03:49.470> superflat

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
got I've made a new world both superflat

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.640 
got I've made a new world both superflat
and<00:03:53.120> yeah<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.690> completely<00:03:55.019> empty

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
and yeah so it's completely empty

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.500 
and yeah so it's completely empty
there's<00:03:55.950> slimes<00:03:56.250> jumping<00:03:56.639> around<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.480> I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
there's slimes jumping around so I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.349 
there's slimes jumping around so I
thought<00:03:57.540> I'd<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.049> quick<00:03:58.260> FPS<00:03:58.739> test

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
thought I'd just do a quick FPS test

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.970 
thought I'd just do a quick FPS test
don't<00:04:00.359> know<00:04:00.419> if<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.569> can<00:04:00.720> see<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.319> can<00:04:01.680> zoom<00:04:01.859> in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
don't know if you can see I can zoom in

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.039 
don't know if you can see I can zoom in
the<00:04:02.099> camera<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.489> little<00:04:02.609> bit

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
the camera a little bit

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.009 
the camera a little bit
that<00:04:04.859> one's<00:04:05.069> getting<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.389> 2011

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
that one's getting this is the 2011

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.069 
that one's getting this is the 2011
which<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.560> getting<00:04:07.919> 94<00:04:08.579> FPS<00:04:09.239> that's<00:04:09.930> where

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
which is getting 94 FPS that's where

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.659 
which is getting 94 FPS that's where
nothing's<00:04:10.440> going<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.010> completely<00:04:11.459> flat

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
nothing's going on it's completely flat

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:17.839 
nothing's going on it's completely flat
and<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:13.730> 2013<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.060> getting<00:04:15.739> 181<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.459> pretty

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
and the 2013 is getting 181 so I pretty

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.879 
and the 2013 is getting 181 so I pretty
much<00:04:17.940> double<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:19.079> know<00:04:19.109> even<00:04:19.349> watch<00:04:19.500> double

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
much double you know even watch double

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.080 
much double you know even watch double
the<00:04:19.979> FPS<00:04:20.599> on<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:22.250> 2013<00:04:23.419> model

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
the FPS on the 2013 model

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.520 
the FPS on the 2013 model
so<00:04:26.090> yeah<00:04:26.270> it's<00:04:26.449> a<00:04:26.479> quick<00:04:26.720> little<00:04:27.199> graphics

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
so yeah it's a quick little graphics

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.339 
so yeah it's a quick little graphics
test<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:28.009> mean<00:04:28.330> obviously<00:04:29.330> these<00:04:29.840> completely

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
test I mean obviously these completely

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.089 
test I mean obviously these completely
flat<00:04:30.680> lands<00:04:30.919> there's<00:04:31.160> nothing<00:04:31.400> going<00:04:31.550> on<00:04:31.930> so

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
flat lands there's nothing going on so

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.950 
flat lands there's nothing going on so
you<00:04:34.099> know<00:04:34.129> you<00:04:34.460> get<00:04:34.849> you<00:04:35.270> will<00:04:35.449> get<00:04:35.659> lower<00:04:35.870> than

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
you know you get you will get lower than

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.999 
you know you get you will get lower than
that<00:04:36.169> when<00:04:36.319> you're<00:04:36.440> playing<00:04:36.590> Minecraft

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
that when you're playing Minecraft

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.999 
that when you're playing Minecraft
normally<00:04:37.430> but<00:04:37.699> there's<00:04:38.210> just<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.479> little<00:04:39.009> test

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
normally but there's just a little test

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.970 
normally but there's just a little test
to<00:04:40.340> show<00:04:40.819> you
