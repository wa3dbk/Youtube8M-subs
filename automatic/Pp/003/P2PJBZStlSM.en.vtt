is<00:01:49.860> where<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.030> only<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> saw<00:01:51.720> glimpses

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is where you only kind of saw glimpses

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
is where you only kind of saw glimpses
of<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> instead<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> having<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.549> full

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
of them and instead of having the full

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
of them and instead of having the full
mission<00:01:54.090> being<00:01:54.390> completed<00:01:54.869> where<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.740> we

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
get to talk to him I think it would be

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
get to talk to him I think it would be
nice<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.829> saw<00:01:59.130> him<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.369> couple<00:01:59.399> times

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
nice is if you saw him a couple times

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609 
nice is if you saw him a couple times
here<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.780> you're<00:02:01.170> very<00:02:01.380> confused

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
here and there and you're very confused

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.160 
here and there and you're very confused
so<00:02:02.159> what's<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> builds

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so what's going on and then it builds

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
so what's going on and then it builds
that<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.710> towards<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> next<00:02:05.700> arkham<00:02:06.060> game<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that up towards the next arkham game I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.479 
that up towards the next arkham game I
know<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.110> past<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.590> I've<00:02:07.740> said<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> wanted

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
know in the past that I've said I wanted

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.809 
know in the past that I've said I wanted
a<00:02:08.640> full<00:02:09.000> arkham<00:02:09.599> game<00:02:09.810> based<00:02:10.200> off<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.580> red<00:02:11.580> hood

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
a full arkham game based off of red hood

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.360 
a full arkham game based off of red hood
and<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.989> be

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and that be

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.820 
and that be
the<00:02:13.489> next<00:02:13.790> arkham<00:02:14.030> game<00:02:14.180> coming<00:02:14.480> up<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:15.319> I've

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
the next arkham game coming up but I've

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.710 
the next arkham game coming up but I've
changed<00:02:15.890> my<00:02:16.430> mind<00:02:16.459> since<00:02:16.909> then<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.480> think

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
changed my mind since then and I think

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.990 
changed my mind since then and I think
that<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.870> would<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.260> much<00:02:18.650> cooler<00:02:18.950> idea<00:02:19.430> to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
that that would be a much cooler idea to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.690 
that that would be a much cooler idea to
kind<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.360> build<00:02:20.629> red<00:02:20.989> hood<00:02:21.230> up<00:02:21.440> especially<00:02:22.069> for

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
kind of build red hood up especially for

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.300 
kind of build red hood up especially for
us<00:02:22.730> fans<00:02:23.120> who<00:02:23.510> would<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:24.470> appreciate<00:02:25.159> the

Joker<00:03:20.870> as<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.109> character<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.799> think<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.940> it's

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
Joker as a character I think that it's

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.390 
Joker as a character I think that it's
about<00:03:23.359> time<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:24.200> these<00:03:24.380> games<00:03:24.650> focus<00:03:25.220> on

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
about time that these games focus on

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.330 
about time that these games focus on
someone<00:03:26.500> different<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.620> terms<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.069> villain

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
someone different in terms of a villain

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.430 
someone different in terms of a villain
so<00:03:28.549> someone<00:03:28.940> like<00:03:29.090> scarecrow<00:03:29.660> or<00:03:29.690> whoever<00:03:30.230> it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
so someone like scarecrow or whoever it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.949 
so someone like scarecrow or whoever it

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
pumping beginning to end because there's

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.800 
pumping beginning to end because there's
just<00:06:04.009> no<00:06:04.370> time<00:06:04.729> for<00:06:05.000> Batman<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.360> take<00:06:05.509> a<00:06:05.539> break
