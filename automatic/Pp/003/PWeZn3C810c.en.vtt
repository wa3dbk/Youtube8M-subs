00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.770 
disc which is personally my favorite is
crafted<00:01:35.159> with<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.579> obsidian<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
crafted with for obsidian and then a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
crafted with for obsidian and then a
black<00:01:37.020> hole<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> middle<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
black hole in the middle it's going to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
black hole in the middle it's going to
be<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> combination<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.210> different<00:01:39.390> elements

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
be a combination of different elements

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.210 
be a combination of different elements
for<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> different<00:01:40.590> types<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.860> discs

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
for all the different types of discs

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
for all the different types of discs
some<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.610> involve<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:42.210> oars<00:01:42.600> or

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
some will involve you know two oars or

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
some will involve you know two oars or
mineral<00:01:43.560> some<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:43.950> involve<00:01:44.369> different

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
mineral some will involve different

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
mineral some will involve different
colors<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.090> wool<00:01:45.240> stuff<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
colors of wool stuff like that so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.109 
colors of wool stuff like that so
they're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:47.970> less

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
they're going to be more or less

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.760 
they're going to be more or less
difficult<00:01:48.479> depending<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> record<00:01:49.200> then

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
difficult depending on the record then

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
difficult depending on the record then
we<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.070> sponge<00:01:50.490> guys<00:01:50.790> sponge<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
we got sponge guys sponge it's going to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389 
we got sponge guys sponge it's going to
be<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> bunch<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> gold<00:01:52.770> nuggets<00:01:53.100> around<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
be a bunch of gold nuggets around a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
be a bunch of gold nuggets around a
piece<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.579> gravel<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.270> guess<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.930> kind<00:01:55.110> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
piece of gravel I guess that's kind of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
piece of gravel I guess that's kind of
good<00:01:55.320> because<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.829> fun<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.280> difficult<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
good because it's fun is difficult to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.959 
good because it's fun is difficult to
impossible<00:01:57.590> really<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.850> is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
impossible really to get so there is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.789 
impossible really to get so there is
that<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.110> make<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> bedrock

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that as well as you can make a bedrock

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.649 
that as well as you can make a bedrock
so<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> guys<00:02:02.399> install<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> server

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so if you guys install this on a server

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.149 
so if you guys install this on a server
you<00:02:03.960> guys<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.259> make<00:02:04.350> houses<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:04.950> like

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you guys can make houses that are like

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.550 
you guys can make houses that are like
impenetrable<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.869> guys<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.530> need

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
impenetrable you guys will actually need

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.639 
impenetrable you guys will actually need
five<00:02:08.399> pieces<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.970> obsidian<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
five pieces of obsidian just like so and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
five pieces of obsidian just like so and
then<00:02:10.679> four<00:02:10.979> diamonds<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:11.910> piece<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
then four diamonds for one piece so that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.000 
then four diamonds for one piece so that
is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.250 
is
quite<00:02:13.250> expensive<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.540> possible<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.019> do

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
quite expensive but it is possible to do

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.470 
quite expensive but it is possible to do
for<00:02:16.040> ice<00:02:16.159> guys<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.580> will<00:02:16.700> need<00:02:16.849> snow<00:02:17.209> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
for ice guys you will need snow and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.970 
for ice guys you will need snow and
water<00:02:17.659> i<00:02:17.840> think<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.230> one<00:02:18.409> just<00:02:18.500> really<00:02:18.799> makes

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
water i think this one just really makes

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.440 
water i think this one just really makes
sense<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.430> should<00:02:19.610> actually<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:20.060> be<00:02:20.239> in

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
sense this should actually just be in

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.720 
sense this should actually just be in
the<00:02:20.510> game<00:02:21.049> for<00:02:21.920> once<00:02:22.099> just<00:02:22.250> because<00:02:22.519> i<00:02:22.549> would

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the game for once just because i would

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.690 
the game for once just because i would
really<00:02:22.909> like<00:02:23.209> an<00:02:23.689> easy<00:02:23.959> way<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.470> getting<00:02:25.159> ice

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
really like an easy way of getting ice

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.750 
really like an easy way of getting ice
so<00:02:26.659> moving<00:02:26.989> on<00:02:27.079> from<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.349> we<00:02:28.280> got<00:02:28.459> Moss

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
so moving on from there we got Moss

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.360 
so moving on from there we got Moss
stone<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:30.049> is<00:02:30.110> kind<00:02:30.349> of<00:02:30.470> neat<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.829> do<00:02:31.129> like

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
stone now this is kind of neat I do like

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.180 
stone now this is kind of neat I do like
this<00:02:31.519> recipe<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:31.909> because<00:02:32.269> it's<00:02:32.420> binds<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
this recipe just because it's binds and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.259 
this recipe just because it's binds and
its<00:02:34.190> new<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.400> minecrafter<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> guess

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
its new and minecrafter I guess

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.430 
its new and minecrafter I guess
relatively<00:02:35.840> new<00:02:35.959> compared<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.349> how<00:02:36.409> old

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
relatively new compared to how old

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.080 
relatively new compared to how old
minecraft<00:02:37.099> is<00:02:37.250> throw<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.849> on<00:02:37.879> some

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
minecraft is throw that on some

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.789 
minecraft is throw that on some
cobblestone<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.599> think<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.019> again<00:02:39.260> should<00:02:39.680> be

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
cobblestone I think this again should be

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.530 
cobblestone I think this again should be
one<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> recipes<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.370> are<00:02:40.549> in<00:02:40.760> Minecraft

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
one of the recipes that are in Minecraft

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.780 
one of the recipes that are in Minecraft
similar<00:02:42.379> thing<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.620> mossy<00:02:43.430> cobblestone

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
similar thing with mossy cobblestone

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.130 
similar thing with mossy cobblestone
through<00:02:44.180> some<00:02:44.329> vines<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.720> there<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> think

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
through some vines on there I think

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.470 
through some vines on there I think
again<00:02:45.379> this<00:02:45.440> should<00:02:45.769> be<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.129> Minecraft<00:02:46.760> then

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
again this should be in Minecraft then

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.910 
again this should be in Minecraft then
we<00:02:47.569> got<00:02:47.690> some<00:02:47.840> ones<00:02:48.019> for<00:02:48.319> this<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.680> grass

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
we got some ones for this like grass

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.000 
we got some ones for this like grass
blocks<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.579> throw<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.879> bone<00:02:50.030> meal<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.540> dirt<00:02:50.750> um
