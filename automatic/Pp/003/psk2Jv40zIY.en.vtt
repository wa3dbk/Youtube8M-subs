00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 it's the beginning of the blog I told you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.310
 in block number 7 where I received 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.629
 just a little necklace with a 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.160
 small camera type go pro to 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.660
 inside that there was another package 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 who was coming with a drone 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.980
 today this package has arrived we are going 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.980
 see what's inside in the body 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.689
 auch aix and a drone that costs around 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.710
 in the 100 dollars and so this drone I 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.010
 do not know so much a shot towards are in 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.010
 made 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:46.870
 thank you ok the drone sees it explore a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.460
 priori a small camera here that we can 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.290
 place or who is already more gay I do not 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.250
 do not know we can do it outside it's 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.809
 not bad 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.820
 I was afraid a priori should not be 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.090
 very big and it's rather it's rather 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.090
 good news 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.430
 again it's the same box that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.989
 the little camera that sent me that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.220
 nicely the site 10 setbacks is so 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.570
 again as in the first 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.710
 video there is no place a products 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.439
 have just proposed to me to want 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.079
 equipment for testing 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.880
 he is too cute this size I like 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.590
 the pack consists of several 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 things it seems to me that I think that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.840
 it's down there you're dunes a joystick 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.330
 then do just in case there are 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.270
 feet a year okay what's six 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.100
 aa batteries 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.870
 that's the thing that hurts but hey 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.870
 I do not even know if I have batteries here 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.400
 I have a control monitor 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:03.170
 it's great what happens to you 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.200
 it's a camera and that's it 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.200
 mouth 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 so I have the return on the small camera 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.760
 who is there what is interesting 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.650
 already is that the return is really 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.319
 snapshot that's really sloppy that 's 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.910
 beautiful garden to turn that into a pile 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.260
 worth a rent apartments today 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.370
 there are way too many buttons 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.370
 leave that ok 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:53.810
 it's not bad power a trick 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.810
 absolutely I understand 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.560
 it's frankly not obvious 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.280
 good for now what I remember from 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.079
 this drone is that it clearly needs a 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.409
 adaptation time before being able to 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.409
 manage 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.420
 this 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.280
 I begin to capture a little bit 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.290
 more for this drone I would say it's 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.370
 still the little monitor is nice 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.260
 I think it gives a pretty look 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.670
 interesting I tried something moaned of 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.019
 different calibration everywhere 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.989
 we will see if I really feel a 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.430
 difference no difference I 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.630
 still have so much trouble controlling for 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.190
 the moment you really need a little 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.600
 time I think is actually I'm coming to the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.190
 control from the moment when I 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.120
 direct cast but I control it from 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.120
 quite chaotic way 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.789
 ok and well I'm going to read a little bit more 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.020
 cold of this drone how it works 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.509
 and that's because he's still 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.430
 look pretty fun hyper hyper hyper 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.229
 dynamic and that's so I think that's 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.490
 can be nice but for now I have 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.199
 really hard to master it as 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.749
 you could see this drone model 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.740
 it's a w elton so it's still available 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.740
 times on the site guide best
