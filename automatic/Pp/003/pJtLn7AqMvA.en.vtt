especially<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> comes<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.640> frame<00:00:20.970> rate

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
especially when it comes to frame rate

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.109 
especially when it comes to frame rate
and<00:00:21.510> improving<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.960> overall<00:00:23.119> efficiency

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and improving the overall efficiency

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
and improving the overall efficiency
that<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> game<00:00:24.810> runs<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.220> also

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that the game runs I think they also

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.279 
that the game runs I think they also
included<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.510> change<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> size

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
included are they they change the size

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
included are they they change the size
of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> block<00:00:28.619> silo<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.310> only<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> 2<00:00:29.910> by<00:00:30.210> 2

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
of the block silo to only be a 2 by 2

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.770 
of the block silo to only be a 2 by 2
block<00:00:30.630> which<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> fantastic<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.600> they<00:00:33.600> made

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
block which is fantastic and they made

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.910 
block which is fantastic and they made
it<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> had<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> B<00:00:34.710> button

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it so that when you had the B button

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.610 
it so that when you had the B button
stock<00:00:35.340> moves<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:36.440> some<00:00:37.440> great

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
stock moves out of the way some great

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.060 
stock moves out of the way some great
features<00:00:37.950> however<00:00:40.670> unfortunately<00:00:41.670> ah<00:00:43.070> when

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
features however unfortunately ah when

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.529 
features however unfortunately ah when
we<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> continue<00:00:45.149> our<00:00:45.390> previous<00:00:45.960> game<00:00:47.539> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we go to continue our previous game this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.040 
we go to continue our previous game this
is<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.899> happens<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:53.309> game<00:00:53.579> over<00:00:54.050> don't

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
is what happens it's game over don't

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.670 
is what happens it's game over don't
know<00:00:55.289> why<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.480> think<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.719> set<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.469> way

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
know why I think they set it up that way

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.209 
know why I think they set it up that way
because<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> save<00:01:01.379> probably<00:01:01.980> won't

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
because it that the save probably won't

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.870 
because it that the save probably won't
work<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> new<00:01:03.359> patch<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.189> guess

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
work with the new patch so I guess

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
work with the new patch so I guess
that's<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:08.210> stinks<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.630> I've<00:01:09.750> loaded<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that's it stinks so I've loaded this a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
that's it stinks so I've loaded this a
couple<00:01:10.409> times<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.830> we're<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
couple times actually we're going to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
couple times actually we're going to
reload<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.060> time<00:01:13.340> what<00:01:18.049> okay

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
reload this one more time what okay

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
reload this one more time what okay
let's<00:01:19.229> try<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:19.909> this<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.180> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
let's try this one more time this if we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.050 
let's try this one more time this if we
can<00:01:21.509> get<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> working

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
can get this working

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.090 
can get this working
I've<00:01:23.689> done<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.619> like<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> third

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
I've done this this is like the third

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.910 
I've done this this is like the third
time<00:01:25.130> yet<00:01:25.549> no<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:26.329> get<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.630> same<00:01:26.780> thing<00:01:27.049> it's

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
time yet no we get the same thing it's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.389 
time yet no we get the same thing it's
saying<00:01:28.250> it's<00:01:28.490> game<00:01:29.240> over<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:30.439> I<00:01:30.979> guess<00:01:31.220> that's

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
saying it's game over so I guess that's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.319 
saying it's game over so I guess that's
it<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:32.329> will<00:01:32.570> now<00:01:32.890> wait<00:01:33.890> until<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.670> next<00:01:35.000> patch

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
it we will now wait until the next patch

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.450 
it we will now wait until the next patch
which<00:01:35.600> I'm<00:01:35.780> assuming<00:01:35.960> will<00:01:36.380> be<00:01:36.500> 30<00:01:37.100> point

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
which I'm assuming will be 30 point

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.300 
which I'm assuming will be 30 point
three<00:01:37.670> point<00:01:37.700> five<00:01:38.390> unless<00:01:38.930> say<00:01:39.710> do<00:01:40.009> something

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
three point five unless say do something

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.300 
three point five unless say do something
really<00:01:40.490> fantastic<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.270> know<00:01:41.360> make<00:01:41.539> it<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
really fantastic and you know make it a

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.499 
really fantastic and you know make it a
0.4<00:01:43.310> or<00:01:43.490> something<00:01:43.789> crazy<00:01:43.909> but<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.820> maybe<00:01:47.179> you

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
0.4 or something crazy but and maybe you

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.969 
0.4 or something crazy but and maybe you
know<00:01:47.630> but<00:01:47.840> actually<00:01:48.259> it's<00:01:48.350> kind<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.590> good<00:01:48.799> in

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
know but actually it's kind of good in

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.399 
know but actually it's kind of good in
that<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.670> know<00:01:49.789> we<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.659> course<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:51.079> had<00:01:51.259> not

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that you know we of course we had not

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.020 
that you know we of course we had not
uncovered<00:01:51.979> all<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.520> content<00:01:52.880> that's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
uncovered all of the content that's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.359 
uncovered all of the content that's
available<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.659> main<00:01:53.810> game<00:01:53.840> yet<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.250> we

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
available in the main game yet but we

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.370 
available in the main game yet but we
did<00:01:55.580> do<00:01:55.940> quite<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> bit<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:56.899> last<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:57.319> I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.020 
did do quite a bit on this last one I
was<00:01:57.649> kind<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.100> hoping<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.520> get<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.819> there<00:01:59.000> and
