00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.860
 the meteorite sword explodes well 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.510
 cause a bit of the diamond sword 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.350
 it does not do anything it's just a sword 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.960
 of diamond but it does a lot of damage 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.930
 sword of water releases water at the moment of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.150
 hit an animal the lava sword 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.030
 loose lava at the moment of hitting a 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.509
 animal or to a mobile sword peak does 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.729
 only more damage life sword for 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.250
 example when we lack life we â€‹â€‹have 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.860
 have to hit a mod with our sword 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.180
 of life and we regenerate ourselves to regenerate 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 half heart 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.950
 let's put here 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.590
 and sword of ender sword of ore 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.290
 wooden sword the stone and the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.290
 iron and now they only do more damage 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.620
 the ander sword only makes the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.260
 modes die only with a blow 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 that we give them a mineral sword at the moment 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.849
 of touching on the floor tells us that mineral 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.769
 there is in that as you can see it says 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.160
 found coal is very useful when 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.970
 we want to find sword minerals 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.680
 meteorite does the same thing as the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.900
 meteor sword only that more 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.269
 big the nuclear sword at the moment of 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.830
 touching causes a terrible lac not the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.380
 I recommend doing it because the truth is 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.329
 the guide much pleasant sword the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.099
 I was watching but he has no bear and 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.840
 in the end he comes to the conclusion that it is 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.110
 Well, you know, we 're not going with the ones 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.110
 follow 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.820

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.610

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.590
