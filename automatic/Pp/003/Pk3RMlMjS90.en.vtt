00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello girls today I am going to give you an advice 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.620
 about some shoes that are 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 little ones or that you have bought with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 some time in advance for the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.809
 event and in the end they had 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 stayed a little guys for example 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 someone happened with my shoes 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.650
 graduation that are these and it happened to me that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.210
 I bought them a few months before 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 was graduation because I loved them 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.289
 and they go great with the suit that was going to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.369
 carry but of course it was winter and the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.500
 I had it as smaller than how 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.660
 it would in the summer and then clear it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 It got a little bit bigger in the summer and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
 like the shoes were there for me and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.340
 Just then what I did was 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 fill a bag of these for the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 sandwiches that are not very big and the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.640
 bud of water then I introduced it here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 and this takes here an opening then 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.289
 what I did was take the tip of the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.490
 bag here nothing to keep it 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.420
 well all this area covered 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.070
 not then I pulled out here and as is 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.410
 I put the shoe 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.540
 well the two shoes I put them to 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.000
 freezer and left him there for a whole 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.920
 night then the next day I put them a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.110
 little bit in the sun so he could pull 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.090
 well the sachet when you will freeze 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.180
 a little ice that had been made 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 of the water bag then I took out the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.320
 bag 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.750
 and then I put on my shoes and it's not the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.860
 difference that gives us with the Saturday of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.130
 before then afterwards, let's go to the truth 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.770
 that I loved another one of the things that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.090
 my sister-in-law told me that I was already doing 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 is so I have not tried because 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 provide is because I needed it and I 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.370
 It was great and since then I did not try another one but 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.040
 she tells me that when a shoe arrives 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.840
 that squeezes him enough or that he's going to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.030
 put for for example at a wedding that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.010
 you will be all day with the shoe and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.280
 to take it comfortable then if you already 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.260
 He put the heel all the previous day with 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.119
 a sock then made it 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.100
 will enlarge a bit and it will adapt 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.600
 better to your foot and then as it is going 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.360
 getting used to that 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.910
 then she was also great 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.980
 so I hope that if you have any of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.800
 these problems because with this 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.540
 solution serves us and that nothing if 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.550
 you have some other solution that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.150
 sure that yes because they have to 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.040
 to have 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.160
 hundreds of solutions for these 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.100
 things and we do not know why 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.350
 we are a little limited to investigate 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.540
 so many things then leave it here 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.940
 below and that surely between all of us 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.320
 we help and finally wearing heels is 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.820
 something excellent so a big kiss and we 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 we see in the next video chao
