00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 Sometimes I have the impression that certain partners only seem 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.970
 exist to mess up my day best example the top researchers of 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.950
 Daniel EK have once again emerged from the depths of the Zoff drains 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.470
 and now try the dealer shelves of this country again with theirs 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.880
 programmed to flood with manure 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 the big-grained Crowded House you're seeing on the screen right now 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 Kiel's opponent is an anti-terror forest and no it does not work 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.859
 on my phone or on passport but on the PlayStation 2 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.050
 the background story he saves first we go right where the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.160
 Action rages action in this case in quotation marks namely to London 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.879
 where a Potro guests have lodged with the Prime Minister and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.570
 Here we go 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.810
 and there we are already small Hobbit Hessen 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.730
 only ca fell through Well then if us times with the dangerous 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 Employ terrorists 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.530
 let's see where the guys are hiding 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.130
 I'll see something in the national chamber 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.100
 Bingo Players Second Pelli 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.480
 that was my one good I grab the other 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.770
 control 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.290
 Well then I just lay around and Kobold at rest computer 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 firecracker 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.560
 I would say 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.380
 I have played some ego-shooter but the control of GSG no 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.940
 Iz real impudence 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.320
 so the character moves or rents the analogue stick to break off 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 in collaboration with sloppy programming 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.110
 you just do not see you doing that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.700
 unbelievable or enough is enough 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.520
 he has rarely seen the Computershare in the roles quite good but what is awake 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 actually not necessary because the opponents in it go individually so controlled 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.520
 that they rent each other for a look in the kitchen 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 unbelievable or and that requires me to be serious now 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.600
 St 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.420
 Bird stepped on the topic are stupid we'll see the in

 Quotes Intelligence of the opponents a little closer to Hello Mister 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.160
 bad terrorist Hello 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.820
 Walluf 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 Well you do not feel it any different 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:18.989
 an absolute hammer is also the professional synchronization 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.989
 we are not enough here 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.569
 they are also well taken over and now lies on the borehole and UMTS 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.569
 unbelievable or respect, there comes one more of the sort 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.299
 with its own homepage on the Internet 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.129
 After all, you can learn something at gsg9 thought so far 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.629
 People are born after these blossoms and those in things took place 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.849
 has seen how the wrong people grow out of the ground now 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.219
 unbelievable or 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.279
 that is yes I could describe you now in the most beautiful shades of brown like 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.509
 I like this game but I just show you know my opinion 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.509
 belongs after 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.109
 exactly in the toilet
