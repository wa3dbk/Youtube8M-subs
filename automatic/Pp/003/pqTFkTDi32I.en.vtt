00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.100 

blockbuster<00:02:00.890> has<00:02:01.130> seven<00:02:01.700> armor<00:02:02.120> nine<00:02:02.600> power

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
blockbuster has seven armor nine power

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.240 
blockbuster has seven armor nine power
and<00:02:03.790> five<00:02:04.790> speed<00:02:05.540> now<00:02:05.870> let's<00:02:06.080> compare<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.890> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and five speed now let's compare that to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.340 
and five speed now let's compare that to
Zeus<00:02:08.090> for<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.600> second

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
Zeus for a second

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.580 
Zeus for a second
I'll<00:02:09.770> grab<00:02:10.010> Halloween<00:02:10.490> Zeus<00:02:10.730> for<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.590> equal

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I'll grab Halloween Zeus for this equal

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.570 
I'll grab Halloween Zeus for this equal
armor<00:02:13.040> Zeus<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.700> lower<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.360> power<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
armor Zeus is lower in power and the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.430 
armor Zeus is lower in power and the
same<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.360> speed<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.820> blockbuster<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:20.440> just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
same in speed so blockbuster is just

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
same in speed so blockbuster is just
ahead<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.010> Zeus<00:02:22.430> by<00:02:22.820> about<00:02:23.060> two<00:02:23.270> points<00:02:23.660> but

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
ahead of Zeus by about two points but

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.930 
ahead of Zeus by about two points but
let's<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.320> go<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.590> hard<00:02:25.040> against<00:02:25.400> power

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
let's have a go on hard against power

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:44.900 
let's have a go on hard against power
wins<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.450> anyway

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:03:10.340 

I<00:03:07.760> was<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.910> fact<00:03:09.090> expecting<00:03:09.750> more<00:03:09.930> armor<00:03:10.320> out

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
I was in fact expecting more armor out

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.110 
I was in fact expecting more armor out
of<00:03:10.500> blockbuster<00:03:10.860> but<00:03:11.520> due<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.910> recent

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
of blockbuster but due to the recent

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.570 
of blockbuster but due to the recent
release<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.810> tackle<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.530> he's<00:03:13.680> insanely<00:03:14.130> high

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
release of tackle and he's insanely high

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.000 
release of tackle and he's insanely high
I'm<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.240> think<00:03:16.080> it's<00:03:16.200> okay<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.710> we<00:03:16.800> get<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
I'm I think it's okay that we get a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.130 
I'm I think it's okay that we get a
power<00:03:17.280> themed<00:03:17.640> Robo<00:03:18.060> once<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.540> while<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.110> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
power themed Robo once in a while but I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.170 
power themed Robo once in a while but I
hope<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> next<00:03:19.860> one<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.160> speed<00:03:20.550> themed<00:03:20.910> this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
hope the next one is speed themed this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.870 
hope the next one is speed themed this

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.830 
for an overall rating I'll give him a
probably<00:03:41.530> six<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.010> half<00:03:42.250> out<00:03:42.550> of<00:03:42.580> ten<00:03:42.840> he

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
probably six and a half out of ten he

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.809 
probably six and a half out of ten he
said<00:03:44.020> all<00:03:44.200> right<00:03:44.230> robot<00:03:44.709> he's<00:03:45.280> not<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.640> best

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
said all right robot he's not the best

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.900 
said all right robot he's not the best
his<00:03:46.270> design<00:03:46.720> is<00:03:47.140> okay<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:48.160> pretty<00:03:48.430> cool<00:03:48.640> but

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
his design is okay it's pretty cool but

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.089 
his design is okay it's pretty cool but
it's<00:03:49.120> still<00:03:49.390> very<00:03:49.750> basic<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.500> reminiscent<00:03:51.040> of

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
it's still very basic and reminiscent of

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.089 
it's still very basic and reminiscent of
WRB<00:03:51.760> counterpart<00:03:52.360> as<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.720> expected<00:03:53.410> but<00:03:53.950> I'd

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
WRB counterpart as is expected but I'd

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.220 
WRB counterpart as is expected but I'd
like<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.370> see<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.760> completely<00:03:55.300> new<00:03:55.630> robot<00:03:56.020> so

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
like to see a completely new robot so

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.420 
like to see a completely new robot so
let<00:03:56.380> me<00:03:56.440> know<00:03:56.530> what<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.739> guys<00:03:56.890> would<00:03:57.100> think<00:03:57.310> of
