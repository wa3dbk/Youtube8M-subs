 Hi everyone, welcome, but a video 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.900
 windows 8.1 for site ms week dot 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.880
 com and geo tv channel is also for everyone 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.849
 the technet community that comes with 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.260
 My Videos and that as everyone knows right 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.600
 we are already there with a version 8.1 of the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 windows available for download at 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.660
 final version and with that many doubts 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 are already emerging problems too then 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 some people are posting some 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.070
 comments on our channel regarding 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 this update 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 initially has no secret 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.360
 no difficulty to update the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 windows 8 for version 8.1 is however the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.030
 Some people have to have some 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.980
 basic prerequisites not already done 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.510
 so that you can make your 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.260
 upgrade to version 8.1 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 is usually first here in the area of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 job 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.430
 clicking on properties in the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 computer 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.909
 First I'll show you the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 Next I'm taking the test here at 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 Pro version is not working 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.710
 and I'll also show you in the version 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 enterprise and how that works and I 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.240
 I know that many people use 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.650
 single language version is I do not have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 this version here to demonstrate to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.880
 How are you doing this update? 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.829
 but I've already seen that many people 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.890
 can do and other people too 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.770
 Are you having some difficulty here? 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.229
 I'm using the pro version in my party. 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 windows is here o activated this here is 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.220
 one thing you already have to see before 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.600
 was born in windows activated after 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.439
 you upgrade to the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.520
 8.1 it will already be activated normally 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.869
 You do not have to activate again. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.880
 another question that you have to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.219
 be careful not to have problems in the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.689
 update time in relation to the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.689
 substitutes for windows 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.720
 so here in the control panel you 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.280
 here is windows update and you click 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.709
 here to look for updates 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.870
 and if you suddenly have an update 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.330
 you need to upgrade to the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.790
 version 8.1 that is not installed then 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.819
 It's what I point out to you before 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.069
 you are upgrading to version 8.1 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.950
 perform and all updates that 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.810
 are pending there in windows update 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.450
 okay so that there is also a prerequisite 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.220
 and a lot of people are not getting 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.850
 update because it has several 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.380
 updates there to install 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.230
 on this machine I've done all the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.910
 updates you are applying 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.170
 here to view the history of 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 update 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.880
 observe that 1810 I applied all 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.300
 these updates here too 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.959
 so here is this is evidence that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.910
 I updated the last ones in the last 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.910
 security patches that microsoft 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.069
 indicated to me here in windows update 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.970

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.610

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.790

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.579
 depending on the speed of your internet 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.799
