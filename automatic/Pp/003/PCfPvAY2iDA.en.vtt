 [Music] 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.510
 [Music] 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.800
 with androids but it 's very good 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.380
 I'm going to see that slow application 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.910
 called x widget as we see it here is 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.260
 completely free what is the part 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.090
 of the play store so good not the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.469
 would leave so that they can download it is 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.530
 an application that looks like what it is 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.420
 the sw or the super widget pro something else or 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.370
 less similar but that does not apply in the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.989
 which can be the different widgets not 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.640
 now we will see let's enter it 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.680
 then directly to be able 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.100
 apply them and see how it works 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.260
 this application good we enter x widgets 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.210
 here I have as we see in the first part 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.980
 we have quite simple interface 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 they are interfaces with a drop-down bar 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.150
 next is true but simple part 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.200
 which we find in the category of 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.770
 everything as the category 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.719
 theory time and time and date 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.170
 the system as for example whose of 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.990
 battery clock widget or other things 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 well we go to the tab of everything 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.079
 then we will continue to the application 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.700
 itself then we have a part that 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.850
