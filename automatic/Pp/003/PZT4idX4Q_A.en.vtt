00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
whatnot and print it out I've altered

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
whatnot and print it out I've altered
this<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> couple<00:00:30.660> times<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.320> increase<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this one a couple times and increase the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
this one a couple times and increase the
size<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> file<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
size of it so when you get the file it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.270 
size of it so when you get the file it
should<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.120> fairly<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.360> sized<00:00:36.570> mask<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
should be a fairly good sized mask but I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.869 
should be a fairly good sized mask but I
used<00:00:38.610> hot<00:00:39.329> glue<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.860> well<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> can

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
used hot glue on it as well as you can

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.690 
used hot glue on it as well as you can
see<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> seams<00:00:42.770> I'm<00:00:43.770> using<00:00:44.010> stealth<00:00:44.489> from

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
see on the seams I'm using stealth from

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.950 
see on the seams I'm using stealth from
the<00:00:44.820> hero<00:00:45.030> tutorials<00:00:45.719> trick<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the hero tutorials trick on this and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.850

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
something came out you can just use the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
something came out you can just use the
novel<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> heated<00:00:52.829> nozzle<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:53.489> glue<00:00:53.730> gun

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and heat the seam again and it'll come

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.229 
and heat the seam again and it'll come
out<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.660> my<00:01:00.660> helmet<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
out and as you can see my my helmet is

drying<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.739> there<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:06.290> crease<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> top

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
drying and there is no crease on the top

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
drying and there is no crease on the top
I<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:09.030> able<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> layer<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> properly<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.750> it'll

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I was able to layer it properly so it'll

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
I was able to layer it properly so it'll
be<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> nice<00:01:13.170> smooth<00:01:15.020> matte<00:01:16.020> scar<00:01:16.439> helmet<00:01:16.830> when

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
be a nice smooth matte scar helmet when

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
be a nice smooth matte scar helmet when
it<00:01:18.060> finishes<00:01:18.540> ring<00:01:19.009> at<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.280> point<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:21.570> will

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it finishes ring at that point we will

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.490 
it finishes ring at that point we will
be<00:01:22.880> masking<00:01:23.880> tape<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.360> hot<00:01:24.600> gluing<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
be masking tape or hot gluing it on to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.749 
be masking tape or hot gluing it on to
the<00:01:26.659> helmet<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> bending<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.710> properly<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the helmet and bending it properly so it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.690 
the helmet and bending it properly so it
folds<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.829> point<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.460> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
folds out and then at that point we can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
folds out and then at that point we can
either<00:01:32.939> choose<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.110> fiberglass<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
either choose to fiberglass as is or you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.100 
either choose to fiberglass as is or you
can<00:01:37.200> paper<00:01:37.950> mache<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.970> top<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.540> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
can paper mache it on top of that but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.130 
can paper mache it on top of that but
that'll<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.770> next<00:01:40.920> tutorial<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.140> we'll

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that'll be the next tutorial and we'll

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.749 
that'll be the next tutorial and we'll
go<00:01:43.229> from<00:01:43.350> there

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
go from there

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
go from there
on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> picture<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.740> online<00:01:46.740> Facebook

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
page there will be probably a couple

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120 
page there will be probably a couple
pieces<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> aren't<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
pieces that aren't on there or that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
pieces that aren't on there or that
you'll<00:01:53.280> need<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.549> alter<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.329> being<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you'll need to alter one being the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.469 
you'll need to alter one being the
middle<00:01:55.110> piece<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.299> middle

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
middle piece as you can see the middle

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.859 
middle piece as you can see the middle
piece<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.640> however<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> had<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
piece is like this however I had to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.760 
piece is like this however I had to
alter<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.479> increase<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.750> size<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
alter it and increase the size just a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.370 
alter it and increase the size just a
bit<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.159> fold<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.020> gives<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
bit and fold them up so it gives it that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.309 
bit and fold them up so it gives it that

would<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.239> breathe<00:02:20.510> but<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> may<00:02:21.110> close<00:02:21.409> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
would want to breathe but I may close it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.490 
would want to breathe but I may close it
and<00:02:21.769> just<00:02:21.829> add<00:02:22.189> air<00:02:22.730> holes<00:02:23.000> with<00:02:23.299> it<00:02:23.450> later<00:02:23.629> you

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and just add air holes with it later you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.009 
and just add air holes with it later you
can<00:02:24.650> also<00:02:24.860> close<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.879> bottom<00:02:26.390> section<00:02:26.629> if<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
can also close the bottom section if you

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.960 
can also close the bottom section if you
want<00:02:27.049> with<00:02:27.440> another<00:02:27.650> piece<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.890> cardstock<00:02:28.340> it

want with another piece of cardstock it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.550 
want with another piece of cardstock it
depending<00:02:29.659> on<00:02:29.750> how<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.079> want<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.379> mass

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
external turnout I personally like the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.699 
external turnout I personally like the
open<00:02:34.040> mask<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:35.359> don't<00:02:35.659> really<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.349> mean<00:02:36.500> to

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
open mask I don't really see and mean to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.470 
open mask I don't really see and mean to
close<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.190> ends<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.760> know<00:02:37.879> that<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.269> couple

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
close the ends that I know that a couple

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.910 
close the ends that I know that a couple
other<00:02:38.720> folks<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.290> made<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.650> mask

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
other folks that have made this mask

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.089 
other folks that have made this mask
close<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.489> end<00:02:40.609> and<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:42.769> really<00:02:42.980> up<00:02:43.069> to

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
close the end and but it's really up to

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.479 
close the end and but it's really up to
preferences<00:02:43.760> it's<00:02:44.390> all<00:02:44.599> about<00:02:45.129> your<00:02:46.129> lines

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
and don't be surprised if you have to

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.680 
and don't be surprised if you have to
make<00:02:48.590> multiple<00:02:49.099> folds<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.690> different

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
make multiple folds in different

sections as I have you can see it's

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.360 
sections as I have you can see it's
definitely<00:02:53.930> creased<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:54.799> those<00:02:55.069> will<00:02:55.250> go

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
definitely creased but those will go

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.690 
definitely creased but those will go
away<00:02:55.780> remember<00:02:56.780> it's<00:02:57.019> all<00:02:57.170> about<00:02:57.409> the<00:02:57.700> the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
pristine pieces making a pristine masks

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.030 
pristine pieces making a pristine masks
you<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:03.019> can't<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:05.329> any<00:03:05.959> one<00:03:06.260> piece<00:03:06.620> isn't

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
you you can't if any one piece isn't

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.819 
you you can't if any one piece isn't
right<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:08.060> going<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.629> show<00:03:08.810> up<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.260> one<00:03:09.739> of

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
right it's going to show up and one of

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:10.839 
right it's going to show up and one of
the<00:03:09.920> big<00:03:10.069> things<00:03:10.340> you're<00:03:10.489> going<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.670> have<00:03:10.760> to

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
the big things you're going to have to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.099 
the big things you're going to have to
be<00:03:10.940> concerned<00:03:11.329> with<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.569> this<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
be concerned with and this is the

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.979 
be concerned with and this is the
problem<00:03:12.349> I<00:03:12.500> had<00:03:12.709> originally<00:03:13.060> was<00:03:14.060> when<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.510> pay

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
problem I had originally was when I pay

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.309 
problem I had originally was when I pay
perma<00:03:15.290> shaved<00:03:15.530> at<00:03:15.680> cardstock<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:17.109> when<00:03:18.109> it<00:03:18.230> got

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
perma shaved at cardstock it when it got

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.490 
perma shaved at cardstock it when it got
wet<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.919> dried<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.669> bent<00:03:20.239> in<00:03:20.510> several<00:03:21.290> places

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
wet and dried it bent in several places

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.069 
wet and dried it bent in several places
so<00:03:22.250> what<00:03:22.639> I'll<00:03:22.730> be<00:03:22.760> doing<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.690> I'll<00:03:23.930> be

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
so what I'll be doing is I'll be

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.869 
so what I'll be doing is I'll be
reinforcing<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.040> back<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.519> probably<00:03:25.669> the

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
reinforcing the back and probably the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.559 
reinforcing the back and probably the
front<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:26.840> masking<00:03:27.410> tape<00:03:27.440> before<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.569> before

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
front with masking tape before I before

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.960 
front with masking tape before I before
I<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:31.160> give<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.340> some<00:03:31.549> more<00:03:31.669> strength

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
I do that to give it some more strength

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.530 
I do that to give it some more strength
so<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.359> water<00:03:32.569> won't<00:03:32.780> soak<00:03:33.109> through<00:03:33.379> it<00:03:33.500> and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so the water won't soak through it and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.789 
so the water won't soak through it and
that<00:03:35.540> way<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.959> just<00:03:35.989> take<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> nice<00:03:36.530> seamless

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
that way I can just take a nice seamless

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.619 
that way I can just take a nice seamless
mask<00:03:37.250> without<00:03:37.760> having<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.180> deal<00:03:38.359> with<00:03:38.540> the

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
mask without having to deal with the

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.289 
mask without having to deal with the
workers<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.260> that's<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:41.120> main

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
workers and that's really the main

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.330 
workers and that's really the main
reason<00:03:41.329> why<00:03:41.810> I'm<00:03:41.989> redoing<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.919> is<00:03:43.069> because<00:03:43.280> I

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
reason why I'm redoing this is because I

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.420 
reason why I'm redoing this is because I
didn't<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:45.010> also<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.040> may<00:03:46.519> end<00:03:46.970> up<00:03:47.239> using

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
didn't like that also I may end up using

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.089 
didn't like that also I may end up using
bondo<00:03:49.430> body<00:03:49.790> filler<00:03:50.150> instead<00:03:51.109> of<00:03:51.549> bondo<00:03:52.549> resin

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
bondo body filler instead of bondo resin

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.539 
bondo body filler instead of bondo resin
mainly<00:03:55.099> because<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:56.030> didn't<00:03:56.629> care<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.169> way

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
mainly because I didn't care for the way

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.539 
mainly because I didn't care for the way
it<00:03:58.549> seems<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.629> course<00:03:59.930> not<00:04:00.859> so<00:04:00.980> much<00:04:01.099> pores<00:04:01.370> but

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
it seems of course not so much pores but

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.520 
it seems of course not so much pores but
it<00:04:01.669> created<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.060> lot<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.209> pits<00:04:02.569> in<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.349> along

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it created a lot of pits in and along

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.640 
it created a lot of pits in and along
all<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:04.250> on<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.750> sections<00:04:06.139> of<00:04:06.260> masks<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
all the on the sections of masks and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.689 
all the on the sections of masks and
things<00:04:06.799> like<00:04:06.979> that<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.310> I'll<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.519> showing

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
things like that and I'll be showing

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.659 
things like that and I'll be showing
that<00:04:07.940> later<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.449> another<00:04:08.599> video<00:04:09.549> what<00:04:10.549> I'll

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
that later in another video what I'll

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.369 
that later in another video what I'll
probably<00:04:10.790> end<00:04:11.060> up<00:04:11.180> doing<00:04:11.479> is<00:04:11.659> I'll<00:04:11.810> use<00:04:11.870> resin

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
probably end up doing is I'll use resin

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.520 
probably end up doing is I'll use resin
on<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.500> inside<00:04:12.979> of<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.970> mask<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:15.290> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
on the inside of the mask with the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.159 
on the inside of the mask with the
fiberglass<00:04:16.220> matting<00:04:16.549> as<00:04:16.849> a<00:04:16.880> bony<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.900> give<00:04:18.049> it

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
fiberglass matting as a bony to give it

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.170 
fiberglass matting as a bony to give it
strength<00:04:18.409> and<00:04:18.739> then<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.549> outside<00:04:19.579> I'll

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
strength and then on the outside I'll

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.960 
strength and then on the outside I'll
probably<00:04:20.450> do<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.169> bond<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.829> filler

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
probably do the bond of filler

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.440 
probably do the bond of filler
with<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.900> spatula<00:04:24.200> or<00:04:24.530> something<00:04:24.860> like<00:04:24.980> that

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
with a spatula or something like that

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.650 
with a spatula or something like that
but<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.630> will<00:04:26.750> be<00:04:26.780> in<00:04:27.580> probably<00:04:28.580> part<00:04:28.970> 6<00:04:29.240> part

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
but that will be in probably part 6 part

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.350 
but that will be in probably part 6 part
5<00:04:30.500> will<00:04:30.710> consist<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.310> showing<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.150> how<00:04:32.330> to

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
5 will consist of showing you how to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.210 
5 will consist of showing you how to
line<00:04:33.140> up<00:04:33.320> everything<00:04:33.650> on<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.370> mask<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.970> then

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
line up everything on the mask and then

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.770 
line up everything on the mask and then
little<00:04:37.220> paper<00:04:37.730> mache<00:04:38.090> then<00:04:38.330> we<00:04:38.420> go<00:04:38.510> from<00:04:38.630> there

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
little paper mache then we go from there

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.260 
little paper mache then we go from there
so<00:04:38.990> this<00:04:39.680> has<00:04:39.800> been<00:04:40.010> part<00:04:40.280> 4<00:04:40.550> thanks<00:04:41.090> for

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
so this has been part 4 thanks for

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.700 
so this has been part 4 thanks for
watching<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.900> stay<00:04:42.890> tuned<00:04:43.130> for<00:04:43.310> part<00:04:43.370> 5
