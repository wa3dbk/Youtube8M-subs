at the blue encore 300 hand mic so stick
around<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:07.020> check<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.620> out<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:15.150> blue<00:00:15.540> has

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
around and check it out so blue has

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.890 
around and check it out so blue has
quite<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> variety<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:17.010> high<00:00:17.820> quality

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
quite a variety of high quality

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.950 
quite a variety of high quality
microphones<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.939> this<00:00:20.939> particular<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.539> is

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
microphones and this particular one is

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.170 
microphones and this particular one is
part<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.650> their<00:00:22.769> encore<00:00:23.310> series<00:00:23.820> now<00:00:24.029> they

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
part of their encore series now they

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.859 
part of their encore series now they
have<00:00:24.330> four<00:00:24.660> different<00:00:25.519> types<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.760> encore<00:00:27.570> mics

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
have four different types of encore mics

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.930 
have four different types of encore mics
and<00:00:28.349> mics<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.140> their

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
and mics and this is like their

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.610 
and mics and this is like their
condenser<00:00:32.940> model<00:00:33.329> some<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> other<00:00:34.410> ones

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
condenser model some of the other ones

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.540 
condenser model some of the other ones
are<00:00:34.980> dynamic<00:00:35.670> mics<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:37.500> actually<00:00:37.860> own<00:00:38.250> two

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
are dynamic mics and I actually own two

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
are dynamic mics and I actually own two
different<00:00:38.879> blue<00:00:39.390> mics<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
different blue mics I have this one and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
different blue mics I have this one and
then<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.070> also<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.940> blue<00:00:42.210> Yeti<00:00:42.390> Pro<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
then I also have a blue Yeti Pro and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
then I also have a blue Yeti Pro and
I've<00:00:43.950> definitely<00:00:44.190> been<00:00:44.520> satisfied<00:00:45.210> with

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I've definitely been satisfied with

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
I've definitely been satisfied with
equality<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.620> both<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:49.379> inside<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
equality on both of them so inside the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.610 
equality on both of them so inside the
box<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.399> comes<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:51.059> an<00:00:51.750> instruction<00:00:52.050> manual

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
box it comes with an instruction manual

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
box it comes with an instruction manual
as<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.289> it<00:00:55.289> also<00:00:55.320> comes<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.190> mic

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
as you see here it also comes with a mic

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.099 
as you see here it also comes with a mic
holder<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:58.230> attach<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.129> mic<00:00:59.550> stand

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
holder that will attach to a mic stand

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
holder that will attach to a mic stand
it<00:01:01.109> comes<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> carrying<00:01:01.859> pouch<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it comes with a carrying pouch as you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.440 
it comes with a carrying pouch as you
see<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.640> course<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
see here and of course we have the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
see here and of course we have the
microphone<00:01:06.930> itself<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.299> only

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
microphone itself now this is not only

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.359 
microphone itself now this is not only
does<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.810> microphone<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.830> look<00:01:11.189> nice

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
does this microphone really look nice

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.420 
does this microphone really look nice
but<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.720> functions<00:01:13.229> very<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
but it just functions very well and it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.990 
but it just functions very well and it
is<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.299> built<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.619> thing<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.340> hefty

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
is very well built this thing is a hefty

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.340 
is very well built this thing is a hefty
mic<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:20.009> solid<00:01:20.310> metal<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:22.140> weighs

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
mic it's like solid metal and it weighs

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100 
mic it's like solid metal and it weighs
almost<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.920> pound<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.630> imagine<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
almost a pound so I can imagine that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
almost a pound so I can imagine that
this<00:01:25.350> thing's<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.189> hold<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.939> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this thing's gonna really hold up you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.890 
this thing's gonna really hold up you
know<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> long-term<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:29.180> now<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
know for a long-term use now it is a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.069 
know for a long-term use now it is a
condenser<00:01:31.500> microphone<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:33.509> has<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
condenser microphone and it has a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
condenser microphone and it has a
cardioid<00:01:34.710> pattern<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.270> actually

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
cardioid pattern so that's actually

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
cardioid pattern so that's actually
pretty<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> means<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pretty good because that means it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.039 
pretty good because that means it's
really<00:01:38.280> only<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> pick<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
really only going to pick up the the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260 
really only going to pick up the the
sound<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.740> closest<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> front

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
sound that's closest to it in the front

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.679 
sound that's closest to it in the front
and<00:01:43.579> it<00:01:44.579> won't<00:01:44.759> pick<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.090> too<00:01:45.270> much<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and it won't pick up too much of the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.410 
and it won't pick up too much of the
ambient<00:01:46.170> noise<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> has<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> pretty<00:01:48.060> wide

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
ambient noise and it has a pretty wide

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.749 
ambient noise and it has a pretty wide
frequency<00:01:49.170> response<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.310> 40

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
frequency response it's like from 40

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
frequency response it's like from 40
Hertz<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.390> 20<00:01:52.170> kilohertz<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.170> XLR

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
Hertz to 20 kilohertz and it is an XLR

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.389 
Hertz to 20 kilohertz and it is an XLR
microphone<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.619> require<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
microphone so it will require that and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.420 
microphone so it will require that and
also<00:01:59.759> needs<00:02:00.030> phantom<00:02:00.570> power<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.159> hook

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
also needs phantom power so you can hook

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
also needs phantom power so you can hook
this<00:02:02.579> thing<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.939> -<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.450> tasks<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
this thing up - you're like tasks like I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.690 
this thing up - you're like tasks like I
am<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:05.100> done<00:02:05.369> which<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> tascam<00:02:06.390> dr<00:02:06.750> 100

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
am have done which is a tascam dr 100

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.089 
am have done which is a tascam dr 100
mark<00:02:08.700> ii<00:02:08.910> recorder<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:10.619> supplies<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
mark ii recorder and it supplies the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.500 
mark ii recorder and it supplies the
phantom<00:02:11.700> power<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.180> required<00:02:12.270> by<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> mic

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
phantom power that's required by the mic

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
phantom power that's required by the mic
so<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.590> keep<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:14.980> mind<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.030> would

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
so just keep that in mind that you would

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.000 
so just keep that in mind that you would
need<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.440> you're<00:02:17.620> planning<00:02:17.950> on

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
need to have that if you're planning on

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.509 
need to have that if you're planning on
using<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:18.489> mic<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.860> let's<00:02:21.010> go<00:02:21.159> ahead<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
using this mic so let's go ahead and

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.839 
using this mic so let's go ahead and
check<00:02:21.790> out<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.150> see<00:02:22.330> what<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.599> sounds<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:23.849> so

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
check out and see what it sounds like so

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.030 
check out and see what it sounds like so
just<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.299> of<00:02:25.420> give<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.599> an<00:02:26.019> idea<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.709> what

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
just to kind of give you an idea of what

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
just to kind of give you an idea of what
the<00:02:27.250> sound<00:02:27.580> quality<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.590> onboard

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the sound quality is with the onboard

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.470 
the sound quality is with the onboard
camera<00:02:31.060> microphone<00:02:31.599> on<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.230> Canon<00:02:32.590> 5d<00:02:33.480> I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
camera microphone on the Canon 5d I

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.809 
camera microphone on the Canon 5d I
think<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.019> can<00:02:35.200> kind<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> idea<00:02:36.730> that

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
think you can kind of get the idea that

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.360 
think you can kind of get the idea that
the<00:02:37.450> quality<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.140> geminal<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.739> not<00:02:38.920> very<00:02:39.129> good

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the quality in geminal is not very good

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.539 
the quality in geminal is not very good
with<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.879> onboard<00:02:40.390> camera<00:02:41.140> mics<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.650> it

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
with the onboard camera mics and it

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.970 
with the onboard camera mics and it
certainly<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.079> situation<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.769> picks

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
certainly is in this situation it picks

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.460 
certainly is in this situation it picks
up<00:02:45.159> a<00:02:45.280> lot<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.209> extraneous<00:02:46.900> echo

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
up a lot of the you know extraneous echo

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.039 
up a lot of the you know extraneous echo
and<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.920> sort<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.280> thing<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.970> room<00:02:49.269> so

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
and that sort of thing in this room so

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.990 
and that sort of thing in this room so
as<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.379> point<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.709> comparison<00:02:50.829> now<00:02:51.519> I'm<00:02:51.760> going

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
as a point of comparison now I'm going

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.849 
as a point of comparison now I'm going
to<00:02:52.090> switch<00:02:52.299> over<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.780> we're<00:02:53.290> gonna<00:02:53.379> start

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
to switch over and we're gonna start

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.699 
to switch over and we're gonna start
with<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.220> hand<00:02:54.670> mic<00:02:54.900> alright<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.140> now<00:02:56.290> we<00:02:56.349> have

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
with the hand mic alright so now we have

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.150 
with the hand mic alright so now we have
the<00:02:57.190> blue<00:02:57.730> encore<00:02:58.120> 300<00:02:58.660> hand<00:02:58.900> mic<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.950> think

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the blue encore 300 hand mic and I think

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.309 
the blue encore 300 hand mic and I think
you<00:03:00.220> can<00:03:00.370> see<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> great<00:03:01.359> improvement<00:03:01.510> already

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
you can see a great improvement already

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.190 
you can see a great improvement already
and<00:03:03.030> some<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.239> tests<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.780> I've<00:03:05.019> done

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
and some of the tests that I've done

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.199 
and some of the tests that I've done
with<00:03:05.349> this<00:03:05.470> microphone<00:03:06.040> before<00:03:06.220> I've<00:03:06.970> been

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
with this microphone before I've been

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.360 
with this microphone before I've been
really<00:03:07.450> impressed<00:03:07.629> with<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.590> quality<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:09.129> it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
really impressed with the quality of it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.199 
really impressed with the quality of it
and<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:11.040> ability<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.519> thing<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.970> really

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and the ability of this thing to really

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.720 
and the ability of this thing to really
kind<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.510> filter<00:03:13.959> out<00:03:14.140> any<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.220> extraneous

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
kind of filter out any of the extraneous

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.270 
kind of filter out any of the extraneous
noise<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.660> room<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.500> in<00:03:17.859> an<00:03:18.010> indoor

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
noise in this room so in an indoor

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.159 
noise in this room so in an indoor
environment<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.750> thing<00:03:19.989> works

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
environment like this this thing works

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.190 
environment like this this thing works
really<00:03:20.590> great<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.630> fairly<00:03:22.870> weighty

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
really great and it's a fairly weighty

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.990 
really great and it's a fairly weighty
mic<00:03:23.680> as<00:03:23.919> well<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.220> mean<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.609> thing's<00:03:24.849> like

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
mic as well I mean this thing's like

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.710 
mic as well I mean this thing's like
solid<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:28.000> what<00:03:28.150> I'm<00:03:28.239> going<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.389> be<00:03:28.540> really

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
solid so now what I'm going to be really

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.259 
solid so now what I'm going to be really
interested<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.590> checking<00:03:29.919> out<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:31.030> see

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
interested in and checking out is to see

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.830 
interested in and checking out is to see
how<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:31.900> thing<00:03:32.099> performs<00:03:33.099> outdoors<00:03:33.849> so

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
how this thing performs outdoors so

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.930 
how this thing performs outdoors so
that's<00:03:35.019> going<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.260> be<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.709> next<00:03:36.250> test<00:03:36.730> that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
that's going to be the next test that

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:59.250 
that's going to be the next test that
I'm<00:03:37.030> going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.209> do

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.740 

okay<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.319> now<00:04:00.830> we<00:04:00.890> got<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.340> blue<00:04:01.730> encore<00:04:02.150> mic

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
okay so now we got the blue encore mic

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.199 
okay so now we got the blue encore mic
and<00:04:03.290> there<00:04:03.890> is<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> bit<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.400> breeze<00:04:04.640> here

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
and there is a bit of a breeze here

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.690 
and there is a bit of a breeze here
unfortunately<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:06.410> I<00:04:06.590> don't<00:04:06.770> know<00:04:06.950> how<00:04:07.459> well

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
unfortunately so I don't know how well

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.160 
unfortunately so I don't know how well
this<00:04:07.819> is<00:04:07.970> going<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.209> work<00:04:08.240> you<00:04:08.810> know<00:04:08.840> without

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
to see how it holds up this would be a

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.789 
to see how it holds up this would be a
good<00:04:16.160> test<00:04:16.630> whether<00:04:17.630> or<00:04:17.780> not<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.200> do<00:04:18.590> need<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
some environmental noise so I'm going to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.690 
some environmental noise so I'm going to
be<00:04:28.430> curious<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.910> see<00:04:29.140> how<00:04:30.140> this<00:04:30.320> thing<00:04:30.380> sounds

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
alright so now that I've had a chance to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.570 
alright so now that I've had a chance to
go<00:04:35.450> back<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.990> review<00:04:36.650> some<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.100> results

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
go back and review some of the results

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.480 
go back and review some of the results
of<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:38.090> field<00:04:38.419> test<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:39.110> can<00:04:39.680> definitely<00:04:39.919> say

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
of the field test I can definitely say

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.240 
of the field test I can definitely say
that<00:04:40.520> I'm<00:04:40.820> impressed<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:42.680> know<00:04:42.710> given<00:04:43.160> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
that I'm impressed you know given the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.360 
that I'm impressed you know given the
windy<00:04:43.580> conditions<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:45.020> were<00:04:45.200> out<00:04:45.380> there<00:04:45.680> I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
windy conditions that were out there I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.610 
windy conditions that were out there I
was<00:04:46.820> expecting<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.450> worst<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.020> when<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.440> got

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
was expecting the worst and when I got

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.360 
was expecting the worst and when I got
back<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.950> saw<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:50.710> there<00:04:51.710> is<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.890> complete

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
back and saw that there is a complete

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.909 
back and saw that there is a complete
difference<00:04:52.820> between<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:54.020> audio<00:04:54.380> that<00:04:54.650> came

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
difference between the audio that came

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.490 
difference between the audio that came
in<00:04:55.130> on<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.610> camera<00:04:55.880> versus<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.690> audio<00:04:57.050> that

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
in on the camera versus the audio that

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.670 
in on the camera versus the audio that
this<00:04:58.310> microphone<00:04:58.790> produced<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.960> suspect

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
this microphone produced so I suspect

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.490 
this microphone produced so I suspect
that<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.690> microphone<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.870> does<00:05:03.020> have<00:05:03.200> kind

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
that this microphone it does have kind

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.950 
that this microphone it does have kind
of<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.710> windscreen<00:05:04.070> built<00:05:04.610> into<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.300> I<00:05:05.479> suspect

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
of a windscreen built into it I suspect

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.760 
of a windscreen built into it I suspect
that<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.110> really<00:05:06.770> helped<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.250> lot<00:05:07.430> because

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
that that really helped a lot because

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.870 
that that really helped a lot because
you<00:05:09.770> know<00:05:09.890> as<00:05:10.039> you<00:05:10.190> can<00:05:10.340> tell<00:05:10.580> from<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
you know as you can tell from the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.550 
you know as you can tell from the
results<00:05:11.300> in<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.510> camera<00:05:11.840> microphone<00:05:12.320> it

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
results in the camera microphone it

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.350 
results in the camera microphone it
definitely<00:05:13.310> was<00:05:14.300> windy<00:05:14.690> out<00:05:14.810> there<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:16.360> yeah

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
definitely was windy out there so yeah

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.510 
definitely was windy out there so yeah
this<00:05:17.600> is<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.810> great<00:05:18.080> hand<00:05:18.380> mic<00:05:18.590> highly

something<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.660> consider<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.729> feel<00:05:25.910> that

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
something to consider so and I feel that

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.630 
something to consider so and I feel that
it<00:05:26.180> is<00:05:26.300> pretty<00:05:26.539> versatile<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.560> believe<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.460> was

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
it is pretty versatile I believe it was

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.540 
it is pretty versatile I believe it was
used<00:05:29.000> on<00:05:29.270> American<00:05:29.930> Idol<00:05:30.100> it<00:05:31.100> may<00:05:31.250> still<00:05:31.520> be

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
used on American Idol it may still be

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.279 
used on American Idol it may still be
but<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:31.940> know<00:05:32.060> at<00:05:32.270> one<00:05:32.300> point<00:05:32.450> certainly<00:05:33.140> they

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
but I know at one point certainly they

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.350 
but I know at one point certainly they
did<00:05:33.470> use<00:05:33.680> them<00:05:34.390> so<00:05:35.470> it<00:05:36.470> certainly<00:05:36.800> can<00:05:37.039> be<00:05:37.070> used

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
did use them so it certainly can be used

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.390 
did use them so it certainly can be used
in<00:05:38.360> singing<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.289> it<00:05:39.380> can<00:05:39.530> also<00:05:39.890> can<00:05:40.250> be<00:05:40.370> used

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
in singing and it can also can be used

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.260
