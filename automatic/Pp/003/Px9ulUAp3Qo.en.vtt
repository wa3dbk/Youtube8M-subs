 22 years passed away overwhelmed by a 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.219
 train when taking an asylum and a 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.670
 fourth companion that accompanied these

 So they took a picture there on a road 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.680
 of the train and according to police sources 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.230

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.020
 and train these young people because 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.960
 They died, overwhelmed by a train, 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.810

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.580
