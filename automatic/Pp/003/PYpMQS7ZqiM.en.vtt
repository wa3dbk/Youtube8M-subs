00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.350
 that you have commented to me by 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.270
 twitter or several times and I think that in the 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.090
 blog also some that if you could 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.380

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.220

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.550
 that you have them in mobile fan for 80 with 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.980
 99 right now this product like others 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.530
 Many have been transferred by a model 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.410
 in Spain 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.230
 and well let's do a little 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 unpacked to see what the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.870
 product as you see the packaging is the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 typical of the wta at least what they wear 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.620
 other products and is the way is semi 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.620
 square 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.340
 inside 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.600
 30 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.979
 radicular quite placed with zeal 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 the bitch as always giving then 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.369
 ended up every time we can not 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.369
 praise 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.180
 is that so much zeal 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.310
 Well, it's not very nice 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.670
 in packaging but important in the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670
 tissue 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.530
 climates 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.400
 is the price that pays for this force 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.400
 peculiar to the devices 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.340
 and I want to tell you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.050
 we have the headphones are focused 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.670
 to look like sport and include radio here 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.500
 we have the little button will not be distinguished 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.310
 in the fm video for the radio are 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 quite flexible 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.160
 As you can see, it will adapt very well to the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.840
 ear 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.430
 and has this city ​​behind good 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.430
 so to place it yes 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.900
 in case our breasts fall out 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.900
 that you're welcome to the neck 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.440
 is more focused on sweat and 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.550
 things like that because they are helmets focused on 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.590
 sport 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.140
 this product we are going to do two 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.960
 reviews one of this typical with a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.210
 boxing and then in the post I will write 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.030
 then impressions and other first 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.880
 impressions on everything 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.980
 and then you can go running with him with 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.520
 them a few times and I'll do a 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.810
 second post focused on using as what 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.459
 supposedly they are designed that are 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.569
 helmets for running although of course 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.520
 that type of helmet can be used 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.850
 perfectly for 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.900
 for normal use it is not essential 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.900
 do sports for it 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.390
 here bring the microusb charger but 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.390
 nano usb seems 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.070
 with an English- speaking actor not 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.540
 you know that moving fail usually sends 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.350
 these producers from england but the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.580
 than the ones you buy in the store but 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.100
 as I have been told back or in other 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.100
 occasions will carry the European adapter 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.640
 in my case, 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.170
 this adapter does not add anything but 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.170
 in my taste yes 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.140
 and also a set of pads 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.700
 of these pads to adapt it to 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.700
 your old 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.780
 two different types so for 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.280
 so that it better suits our 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.300
 ethical walk said 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.300
 and from what I see 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.110
 a bracelet 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.289
 he had to be for your phone 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.479
 here if 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.059
 or simply to put the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.330
 headphones when when I'm not 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:21.330
 running 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.340
 looks more for the seconds of 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.340
 normal step 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.650
 then apart we have 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.289
 a promotion 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.289
 so that the endo world 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.750
 by tracker that simply caused something 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.750
 so to download it 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.289
 because I do not see it anywhere 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.289
 here in the box 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.540
 It puts that bringing an exclusive world 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.780
 for this device then not 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.340
 I'm not sure how it will be downloaded but 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.280
 not of the mobile, he will comment it in the 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.260
 post 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.260
 and a small instruction manual 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.710
 Well, a little with the operation 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.710
 basic 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.530
 of these headphones that are compatible 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.449
 of course with the iphone with the ipad 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.880
 with the potax and practically I think with 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:45.160
 any mobile that you have short 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.150
 today we are going to review the 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.150
 buttons that are not many 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.840
 here we have a button to play and pause 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.650
 this completely if I'm not wrong is 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.650
 the right earphone 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.080
 we have here a little eyelash 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.680
 for the usb micro usb that always 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.680
 I confuse 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.710
 the button that I said before fm 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.710
 and more or less gourmet 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:24.849
 and then on the other side 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.849
 As you can see there is no button 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.410
 Well, I'm going to load the ones 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.900
 I was in charge of synchronizing the phone better 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.060
 I will try a little bit and in the well of 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.150
 I write impressions and that is is heard and 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.580
 everything that goes well 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.300
 habits and movement equipment 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.300
 cañete that sells 3
