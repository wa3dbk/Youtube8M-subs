oh<00:00:09.599> my<00:00:10.599> name<00:00:10.750> is<00:00:10.870> Steven<00:00:11.139> Modar<00:00:11.440> and<00:00:11.650> today<00:00:12.250> I

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
oh my name is Steven Modar and today I

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.770 
oh my name is Steven Modar and today I
will<00:00:12.429> show<00:00:12.730> you<00:00:12.759> how<00:00:13.030> we<00:00:13.090> test<00:00:13.389> your<00:00:13.540> gold

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
will show you how we test your gold

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.869 
will show you how we test your gold
using<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.290> most<00:00:14.500> common<00:00:14.889> testing<00:00:15.219> method<00:00:15.580> the

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
using the most common testing method the

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.370 
using the most common testing method the
acid<00:00:16.209> test

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.750 

alright<00:00:20.380> now<00:00:20.560> let's<00:00:20.830> take<00:00:21.010> this<00:00:21.160> 10<00:00:21.400> karat

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
alright now let's take this 10 karat

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.179 
alright now let's take this 10 karat
gold<00:00:21.970> watch<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:22.570> test<00:00:23.410> it<00:00:23.590> to<00:00:23.619> determine<00:00:23.949> the

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
gold watch and test it to determine the

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.330 
gold watch and test it to determine the
purity<00:00:24.550> first<00:00:25.359> step<00:00:25.869> is<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.349> take<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.680> sample<00:00:27.070> of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
purity first step is to take a sample of

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.880 
purity first step is to take a sample of
the<00:00:27.460> gold<00:00:27.670> by<00:00:28.510> rubbing<00:00:28.869> rubbing<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.650> against

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
the gold by rubbing rubbing it against

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.810 
the gold by rubbing rubbing it against
the<00:00:30.010> stone<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:33.040> what<00:00:33.340> I'm<00:00:33.400> going<00:00:33.519> to<00:00:33.580> do<00:00:33.699> is

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
the stone and what I'm going to do is

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.369 
the stone and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:33.910> going<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.120> test<00:00:34.299> it<00:00:34.479> with<00:00:34.600> nitric<00:00:34.960> acid

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
I'm going to test it with nitric acid

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.549 
I'm going to test it with nitric acid
for<00:00:36.159> a<00:00:36.190> 10<00:00:36.489> cap<00:00:36.699> and<00:00:37.690> we'll<00:00:37.870> try<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.049> determine

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
for a 10 cap and we'll try to determine

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.509 
for a 10 cap and we'll try to determine
if<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:38.830> is<00:00:38.979> indeed<00:00:39.309> 10<00:00:39.610> karat<00:00:39.970> gold<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:42.010> if<00:00:42.309> the

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
if it is indeed 10 karat gold now if the

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.840 
if it is indeed 10 karat gold now if the
streak<00:00:42.820> fades<00:00:43.120> at<00:00:43.299> all<00:00:43.589> then<00:00:44.589> it's<00:00:45.309> not<00:00:45.580> 10

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
streak fades at all then it's not 10

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.329 
streak fades at all then it's not 10
karat<00:00:46.269> you<00:00:46.839> can<00:00:47.110> clearly<00:00:47.500> see<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.920> this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
karat you can clearly see that this

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.780 
karat you can clearly see that this
streak<00:00:49.269> is<00:00:49.479> intact<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.559> does<00:00:51.070> pass<00:00:51.309> for<00:00:51.640> 10

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
streak is intact so it does pass for 10

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.869 
streak is intact so it does pass for 10
karat<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:53.170> next<00:00:53.440> step<00:00:53.589> is<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.860> test<00:00:54.040> it<00:00:54.250> for<00:00:54.400> 14

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
karat the next step is to test it for 14

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.229 
karat the next step is to test it for 14
karat<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.190> what<00:00:57.400> we'll<00:00:57.519> do<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.790> we'll<00:00:58.000> apply

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
karat and what we'll do is we'll apply

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.750 
karat and what we'll do is we'll apply
some<00:00:58.600> of<00:00:58.629> this<00:00:58.869> here<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.589> can<00:01:00.519> see<00:01:00.670> that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
some of this here and you can see that

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.700 
some of this here and you can see that
it<00:01:00.909> does<00:01:01.059> kind<00:01:01.330> of<00:01:01.390> darken<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.110> fade<00:01:02.409> right

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
it does kind of darken and fade right

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.860 
it does kind of darken and fade right
away<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:04.000> this<00:01:04.689> watch<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:05.320> 10<00:01:06.040> karat<00:01:06.280> gold<00:01:06.870> now

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
away so this watch is 10 karat gold now

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.050 
away so this watch is 10 karat gold now
what<00:01:08.050> we'll<00:01:08.170> do<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.410> we'll<00:01:08.530> sort<00:01:08.860> this<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.370> put

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
what we'll do is we'll sort this and put

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.940 
what we'll do is we'll sort this and put
this<00:01:10.210> with<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.870> rest<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.290> 10<00:01:11.470> karat<00:01:11.650> gold

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
this with the rest of the 10 karat gold

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.730 
this with the rest of the 10 karat gold
that<00:01:12.100> we<00:01:12.190> have

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.870

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.090 
it's the same approach we're going to
take<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.390> sample<00:01:24.040> onto<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.280> stone<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.710> we'll

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
take a sample onto the stone and we'll

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.370 
take a sample onto the stone and we'll
apply<00:01:29.229> 10<00:01:30.229> karat<00:01:30.590> acid<00:01:31.659> there<00:01:32.659> is<00:01:32.690> no<00:01:32.900> visible

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
apply 10 karat acid there is no visible

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.240 
apply 10 karat acid there is no visible
change<00:01:33.500> that's<00:01:34.460> good<00:01:35.650> I'm<00:01:36.650> going<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:36.860> test<00:01:37.100> it

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
change that's good I'm going to test it

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.570 
change that's good I'm going to test it
for<00:01:37.369> 14

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.200 

no<00:01:42.180> difference<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.080> 14<00:01:43.590> karat<00:01:43.620> pure<00:01:44.210> now

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
no difference it is 14 karat pure now

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
no difference it is 14 karat pure now
let's<00:01:45.450> test<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:49.910> 1880<00:01:50.910> makes<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> fade<00:01:52.070> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
let's test it for 1880 makes it fade so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.450 
let's test it for 1880 makes it fade so
we<00:01:53.370> know<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.550> this<00:01:53.910> ring<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.300> 14<00:01:54.990> karat<00:01:55.380> gold

one more ring for you today take a
sample<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.719> gold<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.989> repeat<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
sample of the gold and repeat the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.300 
sample of the gold and repeat the
process<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:13.340> more<00:02:13.519> time

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.190 

correct<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.540> okay

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.570 

14<00:02:24.190> karat<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:25.390> good

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.130 

18-karat<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:33.200> good<00:02:35.650> tested<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:37.090> 22-karat<00:02:38.140> see

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
18-karat is good tested for 22-karat see

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:49.960 
18-karat is good tested for 22-karat see
if<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.530> 22<00:02:40.100> karat<00:02:40.490> pure<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:49.490> is<00:02:49.700> going

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
if this is 22 karat pure this is going

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.930 
if this is 22 karat pure this is going
to<00:02:50.090> begin<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.510> fade<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.070> ring<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.430> 18

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
to begin to fade so this ring is 18

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.060 
to begin to fade so this ring is 18
karat<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.080> there<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.740> that's<00:02:54.890> how

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
karat and there you have it that's how

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.750 
karat and there you have it that's how
each<00:02:55.310> piece<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.790> tested<00:02:56.410> sorted<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.640> at<00:02:58.640> the
