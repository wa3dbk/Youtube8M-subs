00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
two already spoke to person one so

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.750 
two already spoke to person one so
they're<00:01:47.530> gonna<00:01:47.620> be<00:01:47.830> focusing<00:01:48.280> on<00:01:48.400> calling

they're done with their calls now what

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.550 
they're done with their calls now what
I'm<00:01:54.940> doing<00:01:55.210> right<00:01:55.300> now<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.510> I'm<00:01:55.840> I'm<00:01:56.050> working

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
I'm doing right now is I'm I'm working

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.530 
I'm doing right now is I'm I'm working
it<00:01:56.710> out<00:01:56.830> I'm<00:01:57.310> taking<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.820> very<00:01:58.030> hands-on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
it out I'm taking a very hands-on

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.899 
it out I'm taking a very hands-on
strategy<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.260> solve<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.100> problem<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.729> think

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
strategy to solve this problem I think

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.719 
strategy to solve this problem I think
for<00:02:01.270> prom<00:02:01.810> like<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.250> best<00:02:03.490> way

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
for prom like this this is the best way

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.219 
for prom like this this is the best way
to<00:02:03.760> find<00:02:04.090> out<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.270> different<00:02:04.659> combinations

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
to find out the different combinations

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.110 
to find out the different combinations
and<00:02:05.409> numbers<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.830> can<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.670> amount<00:02:06.909> of

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
and numbers you can the the amount of

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.759 
and numbers you can the the amount of
calls<00:02:07.360> are<00:02:07.570> gonna<00:02:07.720> be<00:02:07.930> made<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.289> think<00:02:08.349> this<00:02:08.590> is

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
calls are gonna be made I think this is

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.740 
calls are gonna be made I think this is
the<00:02:09.220> most<00:02:09.399> concrete<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.179> probably<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.599> most

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
the most concrete and probably the most

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.979 
the most concrete and probably the most
logical<00:02:11.080> way<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.620> doing<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.840> person<00:02:13.840> number

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
logical way of doing it so person number

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.869 
logical way of doing it so person number
three<00:02:14.409> they've<00:02:14.739> already<00:02:14.980> talked<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.459> person

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
three they've already talked to person

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.149 
three they've already talked to person
one<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.390> two<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.620> need<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.920> talk<00:02:18.099> to

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
one and two they just need to talk to

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.530 
one and two they just need to talk to
