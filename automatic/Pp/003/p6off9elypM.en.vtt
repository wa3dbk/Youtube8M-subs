00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.260
 as we already know well all 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.570
 information on the computer is presented 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.440
 as files that are arranged in folders 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.630
 dozens or even stored on the computer 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.730
 one thousand files as in all this 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.119
 manifolds don't get lost and find 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.829
 exactly the file you need 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.619
 maybe you moved the file somewhere and 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.390
 forgot where you are or you need to find files 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.630
 which have the same name 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.640
 but is on different in different parts 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.739
 on your computer's hard drive 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.290
 to cope with similar tasks to us 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.539
 help the search tool which already 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.850
 is in the windows operating system 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.320
 this windows 7 tool was 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.659
 significantly improved by 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.899
 compared to the search tool which 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.370
 was in earlier versions of windows for 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.019
 order to find the information we need 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.920
 we can use two 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.440
 tools 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.350
 the first tool is in the start menu 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.729
 and the second is in the explorer program and let's 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.890
 let's take a look at these 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.339
 tools we will start with the menu 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.159
 start 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.570
 let's go into the start menu and turn 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.920
 attention to this small field 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.260
 which is at the very bottom of the start menu 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.229
 in this field we can lead our search 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.900
 request if we are looking for some file and 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.390
 know his name we can enter here 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.040
 the name of this file and we do not 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.800
 Be sure to enter all 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.290
 the entire file name is enough to enter 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.510
 several characters that are in 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.330
 file name and note 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.040
 as soon as i start typing some 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.590
 information in the search query 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.270
 then my start menu will change to here 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.300
 such which you see now on your 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.710
 screens and immediately in real time then 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.530
 there is so to speak online 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.990
 My search engine is displayed here. 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.450
 the issue that is, I have windows right away 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.700
 displays those documents on the computer 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.850
 either those files on the computer in the name 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 which there are symbols I have indicated and 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.520
 As I enter the characters I 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.410
 automatically changed and search 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.630
 issue 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.420
 for example, I am looking for a file and in the name of which 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.900
 there is a word text that is there is a combination 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.540
 characters text and here I entered 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.090
 words text in the search console for 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.290
 search query and here you see what 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.209
 I have search results here and 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.879
 has a note that all 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.849
 search results are divided into such 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.579
 categories and let's get these categories 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.670
 quickly go first category 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.879
 this program fit into this category 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.879
 all programs that are in their name 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.040
 contain the characters we are looking for for example 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.900
 here we have a program which 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.159
 called recognition personalization 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.349
 handwriting 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.629
 that is, here we have characters text 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.120
 there is a panel 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.340
 control that is in this category 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.250
 we are showing those panel tools 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.980
 controls which in the name of which 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.159
 also there is the word text you this word 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.840
 You can also find it here easily. 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.930
 the brain in brackets here is displayed 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.370
 number of tools that respond 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.319
 our search query 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.720
 you see that we have here brackets 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.169
 indicated 5 tools but actually 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.060
 their only displays 4 and the same 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.849
 for example with files long written here 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.729
 14 only three output is the fact that 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.790
 in order not to increase this 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:31.040
 the window here shows us the most 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.840
 main search results 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.359
 if we want to meet everyone 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.099
 search results we need to click on 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.780
 here is this button to get acquainted with 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.239
 other results that we are with you 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.150

 category these are documents actually 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.560
 here we can have not only

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.359
 category is files that is all 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.639

 words text why 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.469
 it is displayed to us and the thing is that 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.609
 windows searches not only by 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.519
 file name 

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:46.369
 but also by their contents if we are now 

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:47.869

 is said 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.789
 still note that 

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.949
 program explorer as we already know 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.049
 here here in the upper right is 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.779
 also a field to enter a search query 

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:06.679
 and our search query was automatically 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.139
 substituted 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:11.059

 explorer program and you need to find 

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:17.029
 some documents and a little later we 

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:19.279
 back to this field and see 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.860
 how can we search 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:25.579
 on a computer using this field 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.349
 for searching in the program explorer also 

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:29.239
 still pay attention to the panel 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.489
 explorer program tools here 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:32.089
 We have a button to save the conditions 

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:35.239
 search 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:37.369
 if we click on this button then 

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:40.309
 we have such a standard cat 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:43.550
 save as if we click here 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:45.620
 save then our search results 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.449
 appear in favorites 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.550
 note that we have in favorites 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.280
 another element appeared which 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.740
 called text this is our search engine 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.680
 request yes that is, we were looking for exactly 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.620
 this is a combination of characters and now if we 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.290
 work somewhere on the computer and us 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.030
 need to go back to ours 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:08.570

 using the post menu and on this video 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.440
 I finish the lesson and next we 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.250
 you will deal with the search with 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.250
 program guide
