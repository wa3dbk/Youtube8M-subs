00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
think I just due to the fact that the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.440 
think I just due to the fact that the
product<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:36.590> opaque<00:01:36.920> white<00:01:37.130> I'll<00:01:37.760> show<00:01:38.390> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.179 
again opaque white and I used a lot well
enough<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.750> thought<00:01:45.110> per<00:01:45.409> section<00:01:45.950> when<00:01:46.130> i

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
enough I thought per section when i

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.899 
enough I thought per section when i
raked<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.610> through<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:48.290> i<00:01:48.770> knew<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.670> was

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
raked it through so i knew that was

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.969 
raked it through so i knew that was

that<00:03:11.230> could<00:03:11.440> be<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:12.040> factor<00:03:12.959> definitely<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.890> I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
that could be a factor definitely but I

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.430 
that could be a factor definitely but I
like<00:03:15.430> how<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.910> feels<00:03:16.180> although<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.410> a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
like how it feels although it is a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.569 
like how it feels although it is a
pudding<00:03:17.980> it's<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> cream<00:03:19.180> category<00:03:19.810> I

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
pudding it's in the cream category I
