00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.179
 people to spontaneously boxing of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.929
 nintendo 3ds xl the senior woman tempo 3ds 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.550
 xl 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.099
 I have every luca schmidt cabbage from me 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 the endzone is indeed designated 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.369
 nintendo expert and what we do 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.930
 we want to do the thing 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.369
 unpack and above all things 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.109
 compare we also have the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.260
 other devices therefore is a Japanese one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.539
 new 3ds because in normal size and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 respectively corresponding old devices and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.210
 want to talk about the features 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.840
 So I'm just talking 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.840
 first off here colors metallic blue 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 Nevertheless, we have such a behavior 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.690
 not so interesting but here it is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.539
 device it looks like from the front 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 and so he looks out from behind and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 we are now open 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.359
 and which one you can turn on 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 maybe lukas tell me something 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.740
 here so on new features to come 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.299
 is sometimes the obvious one 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 So features are from the outside 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.510
 Visible are best compared with 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 Michael as definitely that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.650
 new godparents will be seen 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.299
 Relatively little start respectively 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.130
 select buttons that are now on the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.570
 wandered side 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.509
 the home button also became one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 normal button recovered what 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.229
 course, of course, is special 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.079
 important is new elements of both 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.490
 but in the second quali analogstick 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.799
 not really a logistics but 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.299
 It reminds you of this earlier 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.520
 at the laptops that means he is 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.200
 not agile but he rules 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.270
 Just follow the direction in the man 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.670
 almost pull 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.689
 Add new shoulder buttons 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.520
 earlier there were only two now in the 4th 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.140
 and also some shifts in the design 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.420
 that means I used to have a wifi here 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.799
 button or a button signal 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 that's gone now that's over now 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.450
 the menu is controlled then the stick is 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 not on the side but on the bottom 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.200
 device is so stowed right here 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 you can also see 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.099
 brought out so exactly like the module 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.410
 there is not any in here yet 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.810
 this is where the module comes in and used to be 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.640
 it up here which means it is already a 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.170
 few changes and what is one too 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.970
 the volume regulate the now mine 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.940
 hiked down the left side 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.330
 exactly you can then here accordingly 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.340
 louder or quieter otherwise make the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.260
 basic features under the hood 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.880
 has something changed there? 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.280
 there are clear differences 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.340
 and once you have believed 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 that the 3d effect actually works 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.160
 has no meaning in the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.060
 nintendo had the last games too 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.220
 not possible used 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.140
 but now it was extra for the 3ds 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.989
 extremely improved ie by a new one 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.610
 technology that will experience the eyes of the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.230
 3d effect also in writing held 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.760
 device can be seen much better 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.579
 how that too we have 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.680
 believe in yes is exactly right 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.209
 that means we really have a lot in the past 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.120
 just had to look at it and also 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.650
 anyway then had problems that one 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.760
 the third the gradierwerk always right 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.110
 has already been enough already 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.209
 looks on one side and she still 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.310
 still a good picture so that one one 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.350
 very obvious innovations and it 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.760
 shows him that the third one is still there 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.200
 not leaving is that means of course 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.780
 believed what was seen in the temple 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.190
 interested not but it is in fact 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.709
 apparently try it for the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 normal state to attack it again 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.880
 We want a short size comparison 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.389
 also do because here we have one 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.600
 Japanese version of the new 3ds 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.739
 we've had that for a while and then 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.790
 but was sometimes look like themselves because 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.920
 so great with and 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.250
 I also have a short look that is here 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.629
 So if I put it down like this 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.879
 the difference here we have the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:49.129
 small new 3ds and there we have the 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:51.709
 big I 'm doing a bit of a see that 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.970
 whole then from now you can to 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.540
 maybe even the old ones 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.209
 models 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.030
 here we have the little 3d 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.030
 is an oldschool 3ds so to speak and here 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.560
 3ds x11 as looks's because now from 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.329
 with the costs what do I have the doubt 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.040
 for the big stage the big one costs 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:13.879
 200 euro so 119 and the small one 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.180
 169 that is 20 30 30 euro 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.220
 so yes I guess who the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.599
 I should grab the bigger one 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.610
 because that's easy at the same time 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.380
 old 3ds now just showed that 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.930
 much more pleasant than the big one 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.820
 screen and actually from the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.740
 Handling is not a big difference 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.780
 yes does not want to even now 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.759
 big i mean when you look at age old 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.889
 handheld back like the left of atari 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.570
 or should the life of all things be there 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.460
 the rose burst when the purely 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.289
 but stuck in big bags 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.630
 of course, but apart from that 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.430
 there is something else about them 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.479
 features yes and we still have one 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.099
 few features left out that much 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.630
 important are probably 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.220
 best known and that is the device now 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.570
 technically stronger than before the hot 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.139
 are not playing possible before 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.510
 were possible 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.070
 it was announced at that time with smaller 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.389
 picture quality an implementation of one 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.620
 japanese role play that in front of you 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.260
 few years has appeared 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.090
 that on the old 3ds was a thing of the 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.889
 Impossibility of the performance of one 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.080
 We would have implemented now 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.760
 looked bad and determined 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.320
 jerked and on new device should it 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.770
 The first experiences after very good 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.300
 to run 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.520
 so it does not exist yet but that 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.919
 First report that should be very good 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.120
 look and it will be possible 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.070
 It used to be a bit early 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.840
 weaker than the wii and now you should 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.220
 you are a bit stronger that is it 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.900
 would definitely new better 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.090
 the experiences will be possible in 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.990
 connection with new ones 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.670
 control options and will 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.410
 Also new on the device is a nfc 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.710
 function 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.510
 So that means you have a nfc chip 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.880
 that we have one from skylanders or 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.140
 before exactly from these these sonja and 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.070
 though this year recently with the 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.430
 Amigos a similar initiative 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.080
 started and for the normal 3ds becomes 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.720
 buying it be necessary a modem that 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.940
 you put the device then you can 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.640
 transferred yes the new device is it 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.800
 easy on it comes to so what 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.220
 Overall, it seems a round thing too 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.430
 his 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.230
 the new 3ds here in the xl version and 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.420
 Of course you will observe that as well 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.160
 and play games for the device 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.740
 and then look that nintendo too 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.020
 this extended hardware benefits for 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.510
 lukas uses many to the old sensible 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.510
 Thanks to that, the new nintendo 3ds says
