aware of anything going on the surface
of<00:02:09.519> your<00:02:09.640> skin<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:10.149> even<00:02:10.420> if<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:10.690> a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
of your skin like even if it's just a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.410 
idea here is that the mosquitoes are
there<00:02:22.660> tenderizing<00:02:23.380> us<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:27.000> always<00:02:28.000> wished

that I could communicate with the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.680 
that I could communicate with the

the mosquito did say well sounds like a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
the mosquito did say well sounds like a
pretty<00:02:57.370> good<00:02:57.489> deal<00:02:57.639> chief<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.420> landed<00:02:59.079> I'd

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
pretty good deal chief and landed I'd

pretty good deal chief and landed I'd
probably<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.459> looking<00:03:00.579> at<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.910> thinking<00:03:01.410> do<00:03:02.410> I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
probably be looking at it thinking do I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.020 
probably be looking at it thinking do I
really<00:03:02.560> feel<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> need<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.519> uphold<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.000> honor
