00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.860
 the son of the blacksmith 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.350
 hello my name is bados is 17 years old and I'm 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.400
 only son telling the city blacksmith 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.380
 de taiz 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.290
 I always liked going out on the planets when 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.120
 around to hunt down some crazy 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.530
 But my father always said that this was 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.710
 very dangerous 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.469
 but to get up it's easy I was already 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.570
 middle age almost in the middle ages is 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.460
 in war against the eyes 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.260
 One day I was at my father's shop. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.999
 however some sports is a language 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.280
 when you hear the two-way 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.629
 warriors of the group were passing through 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.879
 around the city 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.010
 they said they gave up the external world 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.739
 to do mission that retained years had 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.409
 given and said that some bodies were 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.359
 killing travelers passing by 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.640
 soon after they buy the whole 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.280
 listening to them talking 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.559
 I was afraid of this mission because I 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.049
 that Cyclopes were not so dumb with the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.670
 who were accustomed to face and 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.110
 had never seen cyclops doing 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.909
 searched for humans 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.130
 the most they do is kill the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.049
 invaders of its territory like never before 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.430
 I had seen no cycle of my life 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.680
 decide to follow them 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.329
 but just to observe from afar I would 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.729
 lots of virus cutting tendons 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.310
 of those big ones stuck in their 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.110
 swords in their skulls what I said 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.229
 for my father who was going to hunt some 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.789
 long and following the warriors was already 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.219
 late when leaving home through 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.680
 waste during the trip was 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.750
 listening to history that was discounted more 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.570
 careful not to be discovered 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.820
 when you get to the front of the hill they have 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.130
 camp waited until it arrived 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.979
 at dawn it was time for psychologists 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.719
 attacking travelers decides to stay on top 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.030
 of a tree waiting and cheering for 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.380
 that there was something soon I could not stand it 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.869
 more stare at those 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.969
 warriors eating and belching until 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.060
 an hour I began to feel it open where 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.850
 I was and started to shake and even 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.920
 wind but started to get stronger 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.700
 when I came across two 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.950
 synchronized my big and strong side and 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.440
 they used lights that were my size 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.530
 the dark night 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 I could barely see the group do not know what 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.260
 do 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.300
 the warriors were sleeping in one of the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
 icons that was on the side began in 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.550
 the group and I saw that it would kill 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.550
 Everyone then had to follow the cycle. 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.730
 I was closer just after tapas 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.010
 that the warriors would come up with an idea 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.380
 when I hit the pic eye with 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.420
 group move his arm he broke the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.690
 They saw me when I fell on the floor. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.130
 I could not scream and the guys I was 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.830
 close the warriors with one blow 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.900
 crushed the head of one of them but 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.150
 Druid quickly woke up and managed to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.060
 escape a spell so that the cycle 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.680
 get stuck between branches quickly 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.290
 another warrior woke up and played 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 his sword set in charge on top of the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.640
 Monster and sun and snatched the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.640
 head explains in blood everywhere 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.860
 I was on the floor and could not 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.660
 to move 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.040
 so I yelled at the group and said 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.290
 there was one more cycle 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.270
 they searched cyclically but did not find 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.060
 nothing after all this 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.709
 I deleted and just woke up my house, my father. 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.140
 was thanking the group that had 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.930
 defeated the cycle tried to raise the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.220
 my bed so I can talk to them more 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.280
 I could not move my fears of having 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.230
 My father comes directions explained everything. 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.540
 What happened to me? 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.890
 falling from the tree that was just 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.730
 without the movement of my 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.860
 legs 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.320
 the day and even tried to heal me but it was already 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.880
 too late 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.980
 after that second day I am observing 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.350
 all the adventurers who pass by 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.790
 my father's shop and wonder what 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.790
 adventures that could be 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.830
