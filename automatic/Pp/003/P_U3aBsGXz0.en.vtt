our second driver Brando
muskan<00:02:06.329> drivable<00:02:06.719> condition<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> we

muskan drivable condition but we

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.990 
muskan drivable condition but we
eventually<00:02:09.690> got<00:02:10.110> pull<00:02:10.319> off<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> track

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.460 

that's<00:02:17.000> caused<00:02:17.540> by<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.840> fact<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.260> that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
that's caused by the fact that that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:32.380 
that's caused by the fact that that
right<00:02:19.400> rear<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.030> car<00:02:20.269> drops<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.409> long

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.050 

brandon's<00:02:33.140> driving

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
brandon's driving

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.290 
brandon's driving
it's<00:02:34.390> probably<00:02:34.540> run<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> pantry

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.690 

so<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:42.050> do<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.380> little<00:02:42.950> bit<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.190> repair<00:02:43.340> to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
so we do have a little bit of repair to

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.940 
so we do have a little bit of repair to
do

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.869

about the testing and then also the trip
out<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.080> California<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.430> guess<00:03:45.520> that's

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
out to California so I guess that's

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.970
