mimic a gamecube controller somewhat and
they<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:31.579> what<00:01:32.579> am<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> trying<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> say<00:01:33.350> they

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.510 
they do not what am I trying to say they
don't<00:01:34.530> plug<00:01:34.829> into<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> gamecube<00:01:35.960> slot

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
don't plug into the gamecube slot

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
don't plug into the gamecube slot
controller<00:01:38.520> port<00:01:39.290> these<00:01:40.290> ones<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:42.920> plug

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
controller port these ones actually plug

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.679 
controller port these ones actually plug
into<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.369> bottom<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> wiimote<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:47.689> they

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
into the bottom of the wiimote so they

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.190 
into the bottom of the wiimote so they
are<00:01:48.899> wired<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.740> wireless<00:01:50.659> at<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> same<00:01:51.960> time

go but you got your cardboard box and
then<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:04.020> instruction<00:02:04.530> manual<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> then

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
then your instruction manual and then

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.889 
then your instruction manual and then
right<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.759> controller<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.539> go

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
right here is a controller there we go

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.420 
right here is a controller there we go
okay<00:02:10.079> so<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:12.090> cool<00:02:12.620> love<00:02:13.620> how<00:02:13.860> its<00:02:14.040> set<00:02:14.250> up

okay so very cool love how its set up
these<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.239> made<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.540> mimic<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.200> design<00:02:16.860> of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
these are made to mimic the design of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.300 
these are made to mimic the design of
the<00:02:18.079> wiimotes<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.470> character<00:02:19.980> themed

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

believe is just Japan maybe Europe I
don't<00:02:26.909> know<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.239> not<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.689> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> states

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
difference is on this one are the home

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.470 
difference is on this one are the home
button<00:02:34.680> obviously<00:02:35.549> because<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.390> the
