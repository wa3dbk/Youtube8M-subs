00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
Budweiser highs so I switched those

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.429 
Budweiser highs so I switched those
laces<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.640> then<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.300> found<00:00:31.509> one<00:00:31.660> on<00:00:31.689> eBay<00:00:32.110> that

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
laces and then I found one on eBay that

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.799 
laces and then I found one on eBay that
I<00:00:32.469> bought<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:33.010> couple<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.460> months<00:00:33.700> ago<00:00:33.809> the

I bought a couple of months ago the
brighter<00:00:35.110> red<00:00:35.920> so<00:00:36.550> I'll<00:00:36.610> probably<00:00:36.790> put<00:00:37.059> that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
brighter red so I'll probably put that

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.810 
brighter red so I'll probably put that
in<00:00:37.390> there<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.780> then<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.710> put<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.070> red<00:00:39.280> laces<00:00:39.489> on

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
in there and then I put the red laces on

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.580 
in there and then I put the red laces on
here<00:00:40.079> too<00:00:41.079> much<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.440> swoosh<00:00:41.770> perfect<00:00:42.579> match

here too much the swoosh perfect match

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.900 
here too much the swoosh perfect match
so<00:00:44.590> yeah<00:00:44.739> I'll<00:00:44.800> probably<00:00:44.949> switch<00:00:45.340> that<00:00:45.640> and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910
