00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.999
 50 stars 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.009
 virgilio having been tested together with federico buffa 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:24.569
 even today we make a metaphorical journey we say figuratively virtual in 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:25.020
 one 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.410
 of the states of the American flag one of the 50 stars 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.579
 that of today 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.740
 it is a rather curious star because it is probably very little known 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.140
 attacks there has not been has a name that attracts market attention the usual 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.960
 Buffalo 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 federico buffa good morning federico angelo was secular 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.830
 and I know you don't go there 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.980
 it's too inconvenient because 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 and the peaceful north-west to get rid of all the different routes 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.470
 incoming mail and there are cities 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.940
 which are called type pucca the hill 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.540
 it is a place for those who love 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.510
 fishing 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.140
 exit and get around by bike 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.360
 I point out a place called Lake Dardenne 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.220
 do you count 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 and in a glacial area 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.340
 among the then 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.970
 covered with pine trees 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 this lake that is truly of a beauty 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359
 softener e 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.299
 visitable on bike paths that will be 20 kilometers 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.510
 and it is a beautiful experience I must say that even for those who come from the side 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.460
 more beautiful than the runner I still have to do 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.170
 how could the Swiss be? 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.100
 this is a man who, for dimensions, landscape rhythms 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.210
 it's quite special 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.990
 the 43rd state of the union its capital 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.840
 eh a not particularly famous city or town called 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.259
 Good evening, I think it's really close to the French but I'm not sure about it 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.100
 walking 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.430
 it is written in French but has nothing to do with it 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.200
 and I guess it's not exactly a metropolis. federico 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.550
 yes it absolutely is not even here life is rather relaxed 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.050
 on the contrary, you have the feeling that you smell of the back of cut wood 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.500
 a winter in the hidalgo 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.770
 It is very symbolic of the United States, but I would like to reiterate this. 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.550
 extrapolate 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.179
 it's a wonderful journey 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.489
 and 'the journey that counts wrote montello nothing arrival there are places of 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.179
 united states where you want to go and see what happens 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.829
 - the perfect grand canyon 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.209
 I point you out though 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.590
 we are along the river 160 kilometers not very difficult but neither 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.860
 face you must know that probably go in the adventures in 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.689
 American nature this is the most quintessentially of all 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.449
 federico buffa that we remember our audience once again is an expert 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:44.940
 a passionate heel 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.730
 of American basketball sports in particular 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.990
 boasts of his game bag at least one visit or more visits to all in the states 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.280
 to all the queen stars of the flag except for the auai this time ever 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.170
 then you have 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.299
 you've really been everywhere 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.620
 but why 1 report to tot arrive in aida or for example I don't know about footsteps 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.749
 basketball or just to see it 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.559
 and you have to find a pretext or tie it something sporty I did it for 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.870
 that cho choated a sports prefect 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.430
 and why 5 days objectively hated calculation that is little 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.699
 visited one of the most enchanting places in america 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:26.019
 then if you like nature we can also point out that the bird symbol 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.869
 euro bloodlord day I did not have time to translate what this is 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.679
 little bird that looks a bit like our passerines 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.789
 however, you promise me a next opportunity to better clarify in English anyway 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:37.710
 the lord club 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.200
 and the flower the syringe with with the y 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:48.029
 I saw a cute flower on the internet but not yet live inna aida opera 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.179
 ski lovers why 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.929
 I can handle skiing with so many large American cities - from laipacco 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.039
 I point out to you the crushing mining town 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.099
 which is a place 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.059
 particularly striking is an abandoned xat mining town which 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:04.309
 been reopened 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.479

 he started writing ketchup 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.259
 and therefore this town has become a reference point 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.109
 kind of like a capalbio 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.779

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.560

 to the London appearance if we think of cinema again 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:28.500
 our ears an author we have already quoted from swan santa grande 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.660
 American independent author who by no means one of the rare rare films that 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.150
