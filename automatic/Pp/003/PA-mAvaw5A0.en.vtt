00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.600
 Welcome back to Frag Mutti TV. A few months ago, I was on Skype 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.800
 Joined Canada to Germany for a Frag Mommy meeting, and there was a desire 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.000
 brought to me, but imagine a delicious sweet recipe here. This recipe 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.800
 is called paving stones 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 and you're probably wondering, what's that? They look pretty disgusting, but 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.100
 they taste really good. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.100
 The ingredients we need are the following. We need melted 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.500
 Milk chocolate, 125 grams, 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.900
 50 grams of marshmallows. I got so nice little ones. If you only 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.800
 you have the big ones, then you have to cut the chisels. Two tablespoons of chopped walnuts, and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 two tablespoons 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.000
 Apricots. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 I did not get any apricots, so I have so-called "Pluot Plums" 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 Bought. That's a mix of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.100
 Apricots and plums. I do not know if you can get that in Germany. 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.900
 I also bought them for the first time, let's see how it tastes. And now we just mix the ingredients together. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.400
 Melted chocolate, 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.700
 Oh, I burn my fingers, Hallelujah, 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.300
 Marshmallows. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.600
 walnuts 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.100
 and 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.200
 the apricots. 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.900
 And you just mix it up now. 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.800
 And with the color you can already think, 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 why those 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 Paving stones are called. 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.400
 You have to hurry a bit, because the chocolate is quickly fixed again. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.200
 And now you just take a baking paper and a tin 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.000
 and now it is just this 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.100
 mmmh, yum 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 Paving stones on it. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.300
 And if you have set the treadmills or paving stones now, 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.300
 then they go for two hours in the fridge, so they can cool down nicely. 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.600
 The two hours are over now, and now let's have a look at the paving stones in the fridge. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.259
 So I have to say, they look really nasty. 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:24.200
 But now I'll give it a try. 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.500
 So I have to say 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.000
 the things taste as delicious as they look like shit. That's really good. 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.100
 That's it back from the kitchen. 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:37.200
 If you have any suggestions, ideas, what else could I do here, 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.600
 Write it down in the comment field, send us an e-mail, 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.200
 send us a video reply, 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.900
 We are happy about it and of course we take the best stuff into the program 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.000
 and 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.800
 then let's see what happens. 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.700
 Thanks again for turning it on until next time!
