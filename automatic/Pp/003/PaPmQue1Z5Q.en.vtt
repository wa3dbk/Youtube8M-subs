 hello friends of well-being to the net 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 today I prepare delicious puddings 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.300
 of spinach we thaw spinach in 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.020
 a meantime pan in a bowl 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.189
 we protect two eggs 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.960
 we go up and white tea on the eggs 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.230
 add the ricotta and mix 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.020
 well until it reaches consistency 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.559
 of a creamy sauce now add the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.320
 test tube cut into cubes and mix 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.870
 turn the oven on 160 degrees and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.340
 Preheat the I recommend the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.230
 mode and to choose the ventilated one 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 time even spinach will be ready 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 in fact we see that all the water is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 evaporated and let cool first 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.260
 to add them to ricotta 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.820
 if you don't like leaf spinach you can 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.650
 always chop, add the spinach 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.740
 cool with ricotta and mix well 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.560

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 to bake the Parmesan cheese 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 butter the cups and add the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.369

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.899
 in a preheated oven and we leave them 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.899

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.670
