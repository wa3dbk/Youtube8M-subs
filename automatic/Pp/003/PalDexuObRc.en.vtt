fast brand new lot of new gloves
obviously<00:00:09.030> do<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> quick<00:00:09.360> tour<00:00:09.510> around<00:00:09.660> so

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
obviously do the quick tour around so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.749 
obviously do the quick tour around so
starting<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.010> pom<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.400> do<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:11.639> this

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
starting at the pom we do have this

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.230 
starting at the pom we do have this
perforated<00:00:12.389> material<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.969> that<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
perforated material here and that is to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.910 
perforated material here and that is to
make<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> more<00:00:15.509> breathable<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.080> why<00:00:16.800> they

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
make it more breathable because why they

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.230 
make it more breathable because why they
don't<00:00:17.070> breathe<00:00:17.250> very<00:00:17.490> well<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:17.970> we'll<00:00:18.119> get

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
don't breathe very well but we'll get

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
don't breathe very well but we'll get
into<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.480> later<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> let's<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
into that later so let's do that up it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640 
into that later so let's do that up it
does<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> micro<00:00:21.810> grip<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.320> won't<00:00:22.529> catch

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
does have a micro grip so it won't catch

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.589 
does have a micro grip so it won't catch
anything<00:00:22.949> which<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> nice

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.480 

okay<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.199> work<00:00:28.349> our<00:00:28.529> way<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:29.279> can

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
okay and as we work our way up we can

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.510 
okay and as we work our way up we can
we'll<00:00:30.029> start<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:31.040> it's<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.099> biggest<00:00:32.250> thing

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
we'll start if it's the biggest thing

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
we'll start if it's the biggest thing
you<00:00:32.640> notice<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.020> padding<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.890> if

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
you notice on these is the padding so if

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.240 
you notice on these is the padding so if
you<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.700> weird<00:00:36.030> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:37.250> wave

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
you look it's this weird kind of wave

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.330 
you look it's this weird kind of wave
kind<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> padding<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.860> I'm<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.040> sure<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.280> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
kind of padding and I'm not sure if that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.709 
kind of padding and I'm not sure if that
helps<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.820> absorption<00:00:42.090> though<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> couldn't

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
helps for absorption though I couldn't

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.880 
helps for absorption though I couldn't
find<00:00:42.870> anything<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.379> absorption<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
find anything on that absorption of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.920 
find anything on that absorption of
energy<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:45.180> definitely<00:00:45.300> looks<00:00:45.570> really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
energy but it definitely looks really

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
energy but it definitely looks really
cool<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.520> like

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
cool and the one thing I really like

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
cool and the one thing I really like

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and so we looked at padding on top and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
and so we looked at padding on top and
they<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> same<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> crazy<00:01:06.150> quicksand

lemon glove so you do have the grip tack

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
lemon glove so you do have the grip tack
on<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> inside<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.220> they're

beats<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.549> overkill<00:03:05.939> but<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.569> really<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
beats are overkill but I really like the

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.289 
beats are overkill but I really like the
amount<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.409> protection<00:03:07.560> these<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.159> so<00:03:09.000> I'm

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
amount of protection these have so I'm

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.270 
amount of protection these have so I'm
going<00:03:09.419> to<00:03:09.480> give<00:03:09.569> these<00:03:09.719> a<00:03:09.930> 10<00:03:10.409> out<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> 10<00:03:10.799> in

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
going to give these a 10 out of 10 in

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.599 
going to give these a 10 out of 10 in
terms<00:03:11.879> of<00:03:12.120> protection<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.959> durability<00:03:13.709> so

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
terms of protection of durability so

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.059 
terms of protection of durability so
with<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.329> materials<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.169> there

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
with all the materials in this there

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.460 
with all the materials in this there
shouldn't<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.430> anything<00:03:17.729> that<00:03:17.879> comes<00:03:18.299> off<00:03:18.930> at

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
shouldn't be anything that comes off at

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.740 
shouldn't be anything that comes off at
maybe<00:03:19.650> besides<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.220> top<00:03:20.370> layer<00:03:20.579> grip<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
maybe besides this top layer grip so you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.599 
maybe besides this top layer grip so you
have<00:03:22.019> micro<00:03:22.319> grip<00:03:22.530> here<00:03:22.769> which<00:03:23.010> lasts<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> super

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
have micro grip here which lasts a super

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.339 
have micro grip here which lasts a super
long<00:03:23.760> time<00:03:24.000> which<00:03:24.599> will<00:03:24.720> help<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.019> durability

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
long time which will help the durability

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.439 
long time which will help the durability
of<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.949> on<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.549> see<00:03:26.729> that<00:03:26.760> will<00:03:27.120> never<00:03:27.299> wear

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
of this on here see that will never wear

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.349 
of this on here see that will never wear
down<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:28.500> theory<00:03:28.829> everything<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.879> hear<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.120> sewn

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
down in theory everything I hear is sewn

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.580 
down in theory everything I hear is sewn
and<00:03:30.569> there's<00:03:30.780> nothing<00:03:31.199> there's<00:03:31.439> nothing

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and there's nothing there's nothing

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.229 
and there's nothing there's nothing
screen<00:03:32.040> printed<00:03:32.370> on<00:03:32.459> here<00:03:32.489> like<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.970> Nike

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
screen printed on here like the Nike

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.030 
screen printed on here like the Nike
logo<00:03:33.269> or<00:03:33.689> anything<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.079> on<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.799> vapor

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.819 
logo or anything like that on the vapor
Jets<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.609> this<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.540> all<00:03:36.720> sewn<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.470> nothing

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
Jets and this is all sewn in so nothing

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.439 
Jets and this is all sewn in so nothing
should<00:03:38.159> come<00:03:38.400> off<00:03:38.519> these<00:03:38.669> gloves<00:03:38.879> besides<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
should come off these gloves besides the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.899 
should come off these gloves besides the
top<00:03:39.629> layer<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.349> grip<00:03:40.829> tech<00:03:41.040> grip<00:03:41.310> which

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
top layer of the grip tech grip which

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.249 
top layer of the grip tech grip which
you<00:03:42.060> still<00:03:42.180> have<00:03:42.299> grip<00:03:42.479> a<00:03:42.689> layer<00:03:42.930> underneath

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259 
you still have grip a layer underneath

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.649 
you still have grip a layer underneath
so<00:03:43.949> that<00:03:43.979> should<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.400> no<00:03:44.519> problem<00:03:44.819> at<00:03:44.879> all<00:03:45.030> so

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
so that should be no problem at all so

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.780 
so that should be no problem at all so
again<00:03:46.019> for<00:03:46.259> durability<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:46.919> giving<00:03:47.400> these<00:03:47.519> a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
again for durability I'm giving these a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.420 
again for durability I'm giving these a
nine<00:03:48.479> point<00:03:48.720> five<00:03:48.989> out<00:03:49.229> of<00:03:49.290> ten<00:03:49.590> mainly

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
nine point five out of ten mainly

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.460 
nine point five out of ten mainly
because<00:03:50.549> there's<00:03:51.509> always<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.810> top<00:03:52.109> layer<00:03:52.319> of

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
because there's always that top layer of

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.929 
because there's always that top layer of
screen-printing<00:03:52.739> grip<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.340> here<00:03:53.579> that<00:03:53.609> will

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
screen-printing grip on here that will

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.089 
screen-printing grip on here that will
come<00:03:54.090> off<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:54.629> doesn't<00:03:55.560> affect<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.859> but<00:03:56.009> it

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
come off but doesn't affect it but it

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.819 
come off but doesn't affect it but it
can't<00:03:56.280> get<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> perfect<00:03:56.790> tinge<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.739> next<00:03:58.739> we

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
can't get a perfect tinge and next we

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.390 
can't get a perfect tinge and next we
have<00:03:58.859> breathability<00:03:59.280> so<00:04:00.169> it<00:04:01.169> was<00:04:01.319> summer<00:04:01.560> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
have breathability so it was summer and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.339 
have breathability so it was summer and
when<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> was<00:04:03.299> using<00:04:03.449> my<00:04:03.599> hyper<00:04:03.780> beast<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.229> was

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
when I was using my hyper beast it was

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.289 
when I was using my hyper beast it was
more<00:04:04.530> fall<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.639> could<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.819> part<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.180> it

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
more fall so that could be part of it

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.659 
more fall so that could be part of it
but<00:04:06.989> these<00:04:07.379> gloves<00:04:07.590> don't<00:04:07.829> breathe<00:04:08.099> worth<00:04:08.549> of

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
but these gloves don't breathe worth of

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.640 
but these gloves don't breathe worth of
them<00:04:08.819> like<00:04:09.299> they<00:04:09.509> added<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:10.019> lot<00:04:10.169> of<00:04:10.199> stuff<00:04:10.290> like

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
them like they added a lot of stuff like

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.170 
them like they added a lot of stuff like
in<00:04:10.829> here<00:04:11.009> the<00:04:11.129> perforations<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.879> help<00:04:12.030> it

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
in here the perforations to help it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.360 
in here the perforations to help it
breathe<00:04:12.299> but<00:04:13.079> your<00:04:13.319> hands<00:04:13.680> get<00:04:13.859> really<00:04:13.919> sweaty

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
breathe but your hands get really sweaty

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.180 
breathe but your hands get really sweaty
and<00:04:14.639> even<00:04:15.509> my<00:04:15.599> friend<00:04:16.229> Joel<00:04:16.560> whose<00:04:16.769> receiver

also letting him try these out and when
I<00:04:19.829> took<00:04:19.919> them<00:04:20.190> back<00:04:20.310> from<00:04:20.459> him<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.909> slipped<00:04:21.209> him

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
I took them back from him I slipped him

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.450 
I took them back from him I slipped him
on<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.719> you<00:04:22.409> know<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.529> know<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.010> feeling<00:04:23.370> of

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
on and you know you know that feeling of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.769 
on and you know you know that feeling of
wearing<00:04:23.849> gloves<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.210> have<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:24.479> been<00:04:24.570> worn

by<00:04:24.870> someone<00:04:25.080> else<00:04:25.349> that<00:04:25.529> are<00:04:25.620> kind<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.860> sweaty

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
by someone else that are kind of sweaty

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.290 
by someone else that are kind of sweaty
and<00:04:26.250> it's<00:04:26.310> kind<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.580> gross

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
and it's kind of gross

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.939

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
and then you know it's really hard for

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.770 
and then you know it's really hard for
them<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.160> make<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.340> really<00:04:29.669> durable<00:04:29.880> dense<00:04:30.419> foam

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
them to make a really durable dense foam

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
that can protect you both suis

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.249 
that can protect you both suis
breathable<00:04:33.240> it's<00:04:33.389> just<00:04:33.539> not<00:04:33.660> possible<00:04:33.870> right

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
breathable it's just not possible right

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.159 
breathable it's just not possible right

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.710 
now with the current technology so for
that<00:04:37.259> I<00:04:37.319> had<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.620> give<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:38.069> 5<00:04:38.729> out<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:38.940> 10<00:04:39.150> in

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
that I had to give it a 5 out of 10 in

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.010 
that I had to give it a 5 out of 10 in
regards<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.199> breathability<00:04:40.770> next<00:04:41.699> is<00:04:41.849> grip

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
regards to breathability next is grip

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.210 
regards to breathability next is grip
so<00:04:43.259> this<00:04:43.650> grip<00:04:44.190> tech<00:04:44.370> grip<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:45.810> really<00:04:45.870> nice<00:04:46.860> I

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
so this grip tech grip is really nice I

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.070 
so this grip tech grip is really nice I
can<00:04:47.550> catch<00:04:47.729> a<00:04:47.819> ball<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.270> easily<00:04:48.539> with<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.960> on

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
can catch a ball so easily with it on

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.529 
can catch a ball so easily with it on
and<00:04:49.319> I<00:04:50.310> think<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:50.849> actually<00:04:50.970> really<00:04:51.120> nice

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
and I think it's actually really nice

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.330 
and I think it's actually really nice
for<00:04:51.810> snapping<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.470> have<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.039> receiver

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
for snapping so you have the receiver

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.800 
for snapping so you have the receiver
grip<00:04:53.699> which<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.090> always<00:04:54.270> really<00:04:54.419> liked<00:04:54.630> for

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
grip which I always really liked for

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.480 
grip which I always really liked for
snapping<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.289> why<00:04:55.380> where<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> vapor<00:04:55.830> 23.0

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
snapping it's why where the vapor 23.0

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.570 
snapping it's why where the vapor 23.0
is<00:04:56.550> for<00:04:56.789> Roseau<00:04:57.360> Center<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.400> but<00:04:59.400> then<00:04:59.520> you

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
is for Roseau Center and but then you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.649 
is for Roseau Center and but then you
also<00:04:59.729> have<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.940> hyper<00:05:00.090> beasts<00:05:00.300> which<00:05:00.509> have

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
this thing on it this kind of rubbery

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.510 
this thing on it this kind of rubbery
kind<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.259> stuff<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.889> nice<00:05:05.039> thing<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.220> this

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
kind of stuff the nice thing is this

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.100 
kind of stuff the nice thing is this
bridge<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.880> gap<00:05:06.030> between<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.300> two<00:05:06.479> so

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
bridge the gap between the two so

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.570 
bridge the gap between the two so
honestly<00:05:07.470> if<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.710> was<00:05:07.860> even<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.159> fullback<00:05:08.520> or

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580
