00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.959
 Now let's talk about new science 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.260
 let's talk about memory and when in 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.809
 the program is done by the columnist 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.849
 memory expert is doctor jorge 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.980
 medina jorge let's talk about plasticity 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.110
 what does plasticity mean and what 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.530
 type of plasticity and when it does not talk about 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.710
 plasticity memory would be the basis for 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.200
 which things happen and we the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 we acquire for example plasticity the 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.740
 ability that the brain has 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.289
 modify its function and structure in 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 the time its structure and in time 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.420
 if its structure are formed the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.339
 experience of being here with you in a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.609
 TV show talking about 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.499
 memory to me modify connections in 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.850
 the brain and me also the voice too 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.859
 what is already looking at everyone 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.249
 everyone depending on the 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.710
 lived experience changes a lot little 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.249
 certain circuits of the brain then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.219
 that's neuronal plasticity but the base 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:04.049
 of neuronal plasticity is in that 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.720
 they change the functions of the connections 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.540
 the connections between neurons 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 an synapses and synaptic plasticity 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.300
 let's say the plasticity that has 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.300
 what to do with changing the function of 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.220
 the synapses connections between 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.530
 neurons makes circuits change 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.470
 because if it changes the connections change 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.200
 the way that neurons connect 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.920
 and that change of synaptic plasticity in 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.620
 the basis of memory storage 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.040
 without that plasticity we would be 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.580
 a mere set a set of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 reflexes as is the reflection of the leg 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.510
 the patellar reflex hits the tendon and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.479
 always has the same answer as the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.759
 stretch of the leg do what 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.610
 you do the tendon you're always going to have 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.970
 the same imagine a brain that does not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.720
 could change its function in time 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.080
 what would happen would be a set of 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.270
 reflexes and come that come from the of the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.750
 genetic in such a way that our 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.960
 our acts would be only reflections of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.690
 what I have lived for 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 the genetics prior to us that is 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.430
 our parents our grandparents now 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.490
 that we are talking about on the one hand that 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.500
 establishes we see the connection between two 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.670
 neurons and that would be the synapse I'm 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.350
 imagining my side in shape 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.210
 schematic of a neuron here a 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.980
 neurona here a bridge was established a 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.500
 nexus the first question is asked 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.500
 they establish nexuses all the time in double 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.620
 euro and are eliminated are eliminated if not 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.230
 is used is eliminated well now suppose 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.570
 that we unite this and I joined these two because 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.490
 I sat down to talk to you and we talked about 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.650
 memory that gender one that maybe it 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.660
 will eliminate if I do not use it more as if 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.820
 there is someone else who would have existed 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.520
 before me now I am using it for 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.960
 another function if it can can exist that 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.650
 there is a plot without overlaps with 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.960
 desertion and two in such a way that there 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.560
 I'm going to for example walk I learn 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.420
 avoid going to a place that bothers me 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.780
 and at the same time one hour later 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.940
 I learn that this place is new and 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.120
 well those are two different memories 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.989
 but that only 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.730
 circuits and how you study to see which 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.760
 are the circuits that are activated when 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.580
 one explores a new place versus the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.709
 circuit that has to do with avoiding 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.069
 a place that bothers me in those two 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.659
 memories that you learn are similar 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.349
 but very different because if you have nothing 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.269
 what to see 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.670
 avoid going to a place that on the contrary 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.769
 that recognize that a place is new to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.620
 change has a huge group of 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.360
 circuits that match being located 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.489
 in the hippocampus for example in this case 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.739
 now your rapporteur that I learned myself 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.170
 every person knows that if there is a well 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.090
 I go walking tried to avoid that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.620
 it's one thing that one also learned 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.989
 he learned that I do not put my hands in 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.720
 plug for creating me electrocuted nobody 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.909
 electrocuta learns before now those two 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.819
 memories that make me avoid 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:15.609
 certain actions 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.169
 it is basically used structures 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.769
 with different circuits but inside 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.940
 the same structure that is there 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.190
 activations of various structure of the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.229
 brain and within the brain there are groups 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.750
 of neurons that overlap in their 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.849
 activity are not circuits entirely 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.250
 separated by that is alive to the best 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.590
 this connection that you are telling me 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.500
 which is used for two not for one 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.169
 memory for three may have but as 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.770
 memories is not a circuit of a 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.919
 neuron or a connection but thousands and 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.470
 thousands of millions surely 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.229
 question now let's say to finish 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.139
 this micro is how it is measured because I 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.150
 I'm going to ask him every time how 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.620
 we do to determine why I give you 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.479
 reaction should not be the same as mine 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.849
 it's not that we both have a neuron 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.400
 marked here and here two red neurons that 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.620
 just joined or 100 today in this 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.930
 At the moment, there are novel techniques that 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.389
 allow at the same time that the animal 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.520
 in man it is difficult to do that in 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.360
 experimental animals like the 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.250
 mouse 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.129
 attack is what is most used or the monkey is 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.610
 allows at the same time to register 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.800
 activate and inhibit circuits 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.169
 specifically depending on the signal 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.090
 neurochemistry that you want to block by 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.129
 example as you know there are a lot of 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.280
 neurotransmitters and chemical signals in 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.770
 the brain today I can particularly 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.110
 to live from such a place to such a place the signal 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.360
 that releases dopamine which is a 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.969
 well-known neurotransmitter and stimulate 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.639
 the other one that is the one that releases glutamate 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.770
 then I can reconstruct the map of 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.569
 connections so you can predict in 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.580
 function that I live here or stimulated 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.620
 here what is going to happen to the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.750
 person to the animal I can predict but to 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.539
 sometimes fails because the biology in which 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.460
 decides and one thinks that things are 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.050
 one way and they are thus with a 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.180
 completely different thing has to 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.879
 start doing experiments to try 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.250
 to explain the observation the jorge 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.020
 medina is a medical doctor is an expert 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.789
 in memory and works as a columnist 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.379
 here in Argentine industry scientists 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.379
 we continue with the program
