 hello everyone good and xico mantis people 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 and we are going to analyze the kinematics of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.910
 zombies of advance warfare I'm going to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.189
 put right now let's listen to the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.110

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.539
 challenges that the German team and a saludito 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.700
 I have not finished it yet 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.200
 but good soon I will have nothing 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.200
 let's see it already we discussed 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.520
 and the sensors our signals from 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.330
 mantecon to its address 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330
 attentive to heaven 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.050
 alfano 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.540
 as a team a report of your state 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.590
 report 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.360
 or not 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.780
 Allied forces and videos someone 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.089
 receives 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 there is someone there speaks here of on me 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.369
 they receive 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.369
 yes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.880
 hello again I thought there were 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.070
 lost arsenals available exo 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.620
 deactivated the detonation pm those of 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.870
 well use of that DNA bomb should 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.220
 to finish with you should be directed are 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.450
 the hostile forces but because 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.750
 team attention something goes towards there 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.500
 fast units and many armen be and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 be ready 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.370
 what the hell are these things 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.190
 demons pasta 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.240
 good as you have just seen we are in a 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.300
 jail we are fighting with the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.690
 enemy suddenly falls into a kind of 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.810
 pumps bombs of adn says that that man 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.240
 those DNA bombs were not directed 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.240
 towards the enemy but says says that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.390
 man who does not understand why those 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.790
 bombs because they do not attack them no or 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.340
 whether that means first 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.090
 those DNA bombs surely 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.480
 apart from charging the enemy they would 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.360
 something special maybe not like zombies 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.820
 because that man does not know what those are 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.790
 things is not what it says I do not know what those are 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:51.170
 things then I think that own 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.570
 of the government the people themselves of their 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.630
 own team from their own group in the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.780
 that they send, let's not say it, they know what 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.480
 is happening they throw those DNA bombs to 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.500
 consciousness to return the zombies to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.290
 everyone 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.330
 will be for later to be able to handle them 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 craving to be able to make an army of 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.670
 zombies that they can handle them from 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.650
 somehow surely when 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.770
 we killed the given zombies 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.530
 account that they throw that green gas the same 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.990
 day the same green gas that is expelled 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.480
 when the bombs are exploited he wants 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.190
 say it's green gas has a lot 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.310
 what to do with all that is happening 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.260
 because otherwise there would not be zombie bears that 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.050
 gas when when we're firing it 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.420
 not that gas comes from those pumps that 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.480
 have fired but the question of 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.989
 million as it is that nothing has happened to him 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.450
 to that elite group when it says how 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.850
 says that man on the radio how is it 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.950
 nothing happens to them if they were there yes 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.069
 they are coughing they are on the floor 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.769
 this has a history this has a lot 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.190
 for discovering a lot by taking out we want to 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.019
 That is great because for me it paints very 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.120
 well I also remember you that you had 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.040
 confirmed what the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.720
 zombies in the following of the efes 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.330
 so then we will have to 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.989
 wait for the first dlc to come out 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.239
 be able to see these zombies do not wait 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.000
 be several maps that is not just one 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.580
 but good here if it was a map 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.740
 just because it's epic, not that it's 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.740
 big 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.820
 that you have tÃ©rek that we can look for 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.130
 things that 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.210
 the story that do not make it difficult that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.940
 is what we like I do not know what we 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.530
 put the difficult things 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.380
 people I hope you liked me 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.570
 analysis in the zombie kinematics 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.370
 advance warfare for the lake 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.370
 subscribe and until the next video 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.220
 soldier look less me who happened there 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:29.949
 down 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.949
