00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
bit of a spin around and we'll have a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.470 
bit of a spin around and we'll have a
look<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> different<00:00:59.430> features

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
look at some of the different features

just<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> red<00:01:14.820> plastic<00:01:15.030> button<00:01:15.740> doesn't<00:01:16.740> do

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
just a red plastic button doesn't do

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.550 
just a red plastic button doesn't do
anything<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> does<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> turn<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> switch

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
anything it does not the turn on switch

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
anything it does not the turn on switch
but<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.189> does<00:01:20.430> bring<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.750> closer

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
but it does bring a little bit closer

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.499 
but it does bring a little bit closer
for<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> things<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:23.759> does<00:01:24.030> add<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> the

detail of the Dooku saber moving it down

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.960 
detail of the Dooku saber moving it down
there<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> nice<00:01:28.350> curve

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
there so you can see the nice curve

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
there so you can see the nice curve
underneath<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.229> please<00:01:31.439> see

underneath here if you can please see

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
underneath here if you can please see
where<00:01:31.740> my<00:01:31.860> finger<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.479> bring<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
where my finger is see if I can bring a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
where my finger is see if I can bring a
little<00:01:33.780> bit<00:01:33.930> closer<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.280> actual

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
little bit closer that is the actual

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
little bit closer that is the actual
on/off<00:01:35.939> switch<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> can't<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> that's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
on/off switch if you can't see it that's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
on/off switch if you can't see it that's
how<00:01:37.350> cleverly<00:01:37.799> disguised<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
how cleverly disguised it is you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.830 
how cleverly disguised it is you
basically<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.810> push<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> forward<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
basically just push it forward and that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
basically just push it forward and that
gives<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:44.930> pull<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:45.960> back<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
gives you the on pull it back to get it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.850 
gives you the on pull it back to get it
