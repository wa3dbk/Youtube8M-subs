00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
hard to play right at first every new

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.179 
hard to play right at first every new
read<00:01:51.930> needs<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> playing<00:01:53.040> time

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189

to<00:01:53.640> break<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> speak<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.470> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.679 
to break it in so to speak so just
because<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.070> new<00:01:56.340> read<00:01:56.549> doesn't<00:01:56.939> sound<00:01:57.180> good<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
because a new read doesn't sound good to

thing I want to talk about with reads
there<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> gazillion<00:02:08.729> types<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.780> reads<00:02:10.020> out

unfortunately<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.709> standardized<00:02:17.459> but

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
unfortunately it's not standardized but

of the read the stronger it is the

reed<00:02:24.720> now<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.400> may<00:02:26.549> think<00:02:26.610> well<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.799> stronger

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
reed now you may think well a stronger

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.229 
reed now you may think well a stronger
read<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.220> sounds<00:02:29.519> good<00:02:29.730> i<00:02:29.790> should<00:02:29.940> use<00:02:30.209> a

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
read that sounds good i should use a

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.449 
read that sounds good i should use a
stronger<00:02:30.599> read<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:30.959> possible<00:02:31.440> well<00:02:32.159> not

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
stronger read as possible well not

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.390 
stronger read as possible well not
necessarily<00:02:33.590> keep<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.769> mind<00:02:34.799> one<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
necessarily keep in mind one of the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.740 
necessarily keep in mind one of the
reasons<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:35.909> are<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.209> many<00:02:36.329> different

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
reasons there are so many different

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.630 
reasons there are so many different
types<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.110> reads<00:02:37.409> is<00:02:37.799> because<00:02:38.400> every

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
types of reads is because every

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330 
types of reads is because every
saxophone<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.450> different<00:02:39.810> every<00:02:40.799> mouthpiece

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
saxophone is different every mouthpiece

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.819 
saxophone is different every mouthpiece
is<00:02:41.519> different<00:02:41.940> most<00:02:42.420> importantly<00:02:42.930> everyone's

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.430

mouth<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.519> slightly<00:02:44.819> different<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:45.989> what

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
mouth is slightly different so what

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.920 
mouth is slightly different so what
works<00:02:46.769> for<00:02:47.129> one<00:02:47.160> person<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.269> saxophone

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
works for one person on one saxophone

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.559 
works for one person on one saxophone
with<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:49.650> mouthpiece<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.430> not<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.510> work

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
with one mouthpiece is not going to work

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.990 
with one mouthpiece is not going to work
on<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.769> another<00:02:52.950> person<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.760> another

sax one with another mouthpiece for

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.369 
sax one with another mouthpiece for
instance<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.579> use<00:02:56.910> very<00:02:57.359> different<00:02:57.810> reads<00:02:58.019> on

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
instance I use very different reads on

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.190 
instance I use very different reads on
my<00:02:59.010> different<00:02:59.400> saxophones<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.780> i<00:03:00.870> found

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
my different saxophones because i found

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.539 
my different saxophones because i found
that<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:01.470> works<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.099> doesn't

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
that what works on one doesn't

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.759 
that what works on one doesn't
necessarily<00:03:03.030> work<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.359> another<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
necessarily work in another so the

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.619 
necessarily work in another so the
bottom<00:03:04.980> line<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.940> find<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.390> read

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
bottom line is you have to find the read

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.289 
bottom line is you have to find the read
that<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.989> right<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.730> sounds<00:03:08.970> good

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
that is right for you if it sounds good

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.479 
that is right for you if it sounds good
to<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.989> it's<00:03:10.440> easy<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.920> play<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.310> gives

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.759 
to you if it's easy to play and gives
you<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.609> tone<00:03:12.000> you're<00:03:12.269> happy<00:03:12.629> with<00:03:12.750> its<00:03:13.079> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
start with a softer read because they're

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.110 
start with a softer read because they're
generally<00:03:33.569> easier<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.139> play<00:03:34.349> now<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.579> you

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
generally easier to play now as you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.610 
generally easier to play now as you
start<00:03:36.359> to<00:03:36.450> get<00:03:36.569> more<00:03:36.599> advanced<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.230> may<00:03:37.410> want

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
start to get more advanced you may want

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.530 
start to get more advanced you may want
to<00:03:37.680> experiment<00:03:38.129> with<00:03:38.280> harder<00:03:38.700> reads<00:03:38.910> because

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
to experiment with harder reads because

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.420 
to experiment with harder reads because
the<00:03:39.660> conventional<00:03:40.230> wisdom<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.739> harder<00:03:41.220> read

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
the conventional wisdom is a harder read

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.129 
the conventional wisdom is a harder read
will<00:03:41.609> give<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.849> fuller<00:03:42.269> sound<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:42.870> bigger

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
will give you a fuller sound a bigger

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.199 
will give you a fuller sound a bigger
tone<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.190> flip<00:03:44.489> side<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.879> there<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> little

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
tone the flip side is there a little

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.150 
tone the flip side is there a little
harder<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.569> play<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.169> takes<00:03:46.470> more<00:03:46.680> air<00:03:46.889> it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
harder to play it takes more air it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.039 
harder to play it takes more air it
takes<00:03:47.639> more<00:03:47.790> breath<00:03:48.090> control<00:03:48.419> which<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.900> why

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
takes more breath control which is why

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.509 
takes more breath control which is why
they're<00:03:49.199> not<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> good<00:03:49.709> choice<00:03:49.859> for<00:03:49.919> beginners

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
they're not a good choice for beginners

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.849 
they're not a good choice for beginners
but<00:03:51.090> again<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.989> read<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.440> gives<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.739> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
but again the read that gives you the

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.520 
but again the read that gives you the
best<00:03:52.980> sound<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:54.150> read<00:03:54.389> to<00:03:54.750> use<00:03:54.959> don't<00:03:55.379> let

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
best sound is the read to use don't let

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.520 
best sound is the read to use don't let
anyone<00:03:56.010> else<00:03:56.250> tell<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.549> otherwise<00:03:57.290> all<00:03:58.290> right

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
anyone else tell you otherwise all right
