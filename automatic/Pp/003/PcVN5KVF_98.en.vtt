it<00:00:21.150> adds<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.810> look<00:00:23.840> yeah<00:00:24.900> eight<00:00:25.170> eight<00:00:25.680> new

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it adds a look yeah eight eight new

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.650 
it adds a look yeah eight eight new
potions<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.420> nausea<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
potions so the first one is nausea and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
potions so the first one is nausea and
that's<00:00:31.650> used<00:00:31.949> by<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.399> bottle<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.059> rotten
