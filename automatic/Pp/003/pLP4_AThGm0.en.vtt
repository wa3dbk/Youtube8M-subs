00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.789
 hi to all of you today 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.670
 the only explosion at 4 pm 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.589
 the city introduced little earlier how m 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.629
 so that the loaders with m and selection a serious 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.150
 a point that's all here's what I believe it is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.550
 compatible me I'm counting five then point 6 points 5 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.079
 afp - six points in the fifth inning the system is completely 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.960
 montreal how to do 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.750
 we do what you do it ask you your debut so you go 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.750
 any ministry 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.530
 on the coffin 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 the link I was wondering what I think 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.400
 what you do you go down 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.460
 the dry pumps range 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.520
 they also did 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.300
 if you are from the league 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 she 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.720
 a blowjob as before 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.720
 in the group 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.980
 in district 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 and then you put them in case you want 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.170
 for the comedian on the term office 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 so yes it's done 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.790
 then a little and that it is not used for anything 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.370
 so what we do next we go to the front then on the sidelines 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.110
 it's a dose of your keyboard 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.700
 it looks like the logo of the site 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 such a tax 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 do not forget to let yourself be looted and landed at the same time 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 it's even a small menu of 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.020
 and looking for baltard or any other meaning 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.140
 in belfort I feel 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 more so I'm not going so I could not altintop 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.990
 if you put to bata for his art database directly in the action 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 army 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.740
 we are interested today 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.120
 others before him 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.350
 from its low point 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.239
 turbine 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.629
 then there you have a kraft hand it's a vicious point 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.569
 so there you click 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.319
 open with 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.179
 and after wii black 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.830
 because when we expected to change or not because without 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.319
 his mirror 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.240
 no mode 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.599
 It's no use 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 you looked disputed for being the case 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 so here is another eiffel tower 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:47.749
 this is yes in hand raised the records of all NATO soldiers 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.610
 in the loubard commando 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.299
 so it's easier to unpack china 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.419
 the canton of vaud 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.319
 what you do 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.329
 put it well 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.199
 and you take 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.509
 everything is nickel like that alltou the unitary chessboard 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.309
 and to slip parcels 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.199
 inside 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.199
 of this file at the same time 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.879
 we do not know what you see 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.879
 it's already done they're there 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.939
 and then all these facts 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.549
 so yes I said to the afp 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.469
 often the same she wants there is down by 4 7% 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.559
 do not play 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.959
 now I installed them every morning at the same time which is very 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.379
 important is for 100 th 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.069
 moreover even fear 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.730
 at two to twelve months of work 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.989
 after spending a month since one year andromède to blagnac castanet the great 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.109
 loop 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.809
 I did not know anything more 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.219
 m 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.289
 by then the UN mission 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.289
 to slip into a match three days 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
 it will remove the most difficult of the state 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.059
 it's difficult 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.809
 which prevents models 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.089
 and if that's if you're expressing yourself 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:06.139
 and yet 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.159
 nag and that's normal if you have not delete a state 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.769
 back in the green 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.379
 the model alain gérard 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.650
 gm wants to delete because it's very important otherwise it will not work 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.449
 he also thinks that the operation of all ministries 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.449
 a volley here for now 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.550
 Culture 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.779
 to believe 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.779
 dorine but all tastes 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.289
 the activity 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.289
 or just cheated inventory 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.960
 so if you are trading moment with us 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.259
 ie6 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.309
 we were all selected a stack of 20 64 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.620
 in fact the most noise 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.900
 before fighting 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.699
 if you want at this point 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.199
 you right click 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.789
 if you want nothing done for me 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.789

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.419
 since mid-December 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.419
 and go out to look 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.800
 116 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.949

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.430
 good if you have a trick is trying 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.360
 seeing that his 64 cents 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.370

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.960
 this station 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.960
 and there we buy 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.669
 in Alsace to his ability to perform on the start 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.089

 and the party 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.499
 in mind the security problem 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.499
 for example you have armor 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.129
 if more than six months 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.129
