00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.850

 some way within our own 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.050
 mistakes because we recognize that we have 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.900

 game mode a game mode for the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.490
 multiplayer gameplay 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.520
 different then in July two more maps 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.700

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.940
 of game and in September a map and a 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.310
 mission these are the content that of 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.070
 moment 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.350
 infinity ward and activision have 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.340
 prepared and it 's lady hammer if all the 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.410
 companies that are working in the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.700
 draft 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.440
 they want prepared if they add something more 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.060
 possibly here under puts that all the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.069
 content that less than announce me 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.209
 is 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:30.170
 it can be changed so it 's what 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.930
 say there is good what comes 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.389
 being can be changed so the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.120
 Content itself wants the company can 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.269
 add things change things but this 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.849
 would be the official content so far what 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.389
 that comes out during the next 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.700
 months 10 maps in concrete and many 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.879
 missions for the special ops for whom 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.549
 have played in special ops can be 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.379
 since both survival mode or 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.689
 I do not know how this is still 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.989
 discover and the game modes also 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.269
 therefore nothing else you decide 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.920
 It's worth doing elite I do not 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.220
 I'm not yet, but 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.130
 with good knowing this makes you want to 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.169
 catch him and I recommend you for 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.150
 xbox users since we have the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.239
 opportunity to catch microsoft points 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.800
 we can still wait for it in the micros 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:29.100
 2 points per pages of live type 360 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.340
 code chips or many more pages than 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.080
 there is a place to get points and want elite 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.240
 for example it does not cost us 60 euros and we 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.430
 cost 36 for example that is the page 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.780
 cheaper than I've found the will 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.610
 leave by in the description in case 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.340
 you also want to catch the points for 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.139
 there and well you decide if the 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.880
 It's worth it to be caught elite 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.070
 comment because I'm very interested 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.260
 know your opinion since I'm under 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.080
 my point of view what is the game in 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.810
 yes it does not deserve to be caught by the elite because 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.139
 we already paid 70 euros on his good day 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.900
 sixty-odd in particular but it's worth 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.300
 worth spending another 36 euros if you go to 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.060
 you were going to play the game a lot 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.160
 that is worth it without a doubt but 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.020
 well that's your decision so 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.670
 nothing says goodbye day and tight and see you 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.600
 in the next news 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.600
 and even the boys
