like<00:02:06.090> Kovalev<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.719> want<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> wonder<00:02:07.829> whether<00:02:07.950> HBO

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
like Kovalev I want I wonder whether HBO

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.350 
like Kovalev I want I wonder whether HBO
would<00:02:08.670> even<00:02:08.940> want

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
would even want

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.839 
would even want
Kovalev<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.200> fight<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:11.099> not<00:02:11.190> Hopkins<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.730> this

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
Kovalev to fight but not Hopkins at this

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.130 
Kovalev to fight but not Hopkins at this
stage

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
stage

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.290 
stage
I wonder<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:13.730> Kovalev<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.850> one<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> their

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I wonder because Kovalev is one of their

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.170 
I wonder because Kovalev is one of their
biggest<00:02:16.290> ticket<00:02:16.770> sellers<00:02:17.069> no<00:02:17.250> they<00:02:17.940> might

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
biggest ticket sellers no they might

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270 
biggest ticket sellers no they might
have<00:02:18.450> confidence<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.080> Kovalev<00:02:19.590> could<00:02:20.160> be

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
have confidence that Kovalev could be

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.900 
have confidence that Kovalev could be
hopkins<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.940> lot<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.569> people<00:02:21.810> might<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.819> at<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
hopkins a lot of people might but at the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.640 
hopkins a lot of people might but at the
