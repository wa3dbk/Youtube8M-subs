take six or seven of our strings and
we're<00:04:32.990> going<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.139> go<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.220> entire<00:04:34.520> length<00:04:34.850> of

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
we're going to go the entire length of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.570 
we're going to go the entire length of
the<00:04:35.330> ball<00:04:35.540> from<00:04:35.810> one<00:04:36.020> side<00:04:36.050> all<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.889> way<00:04:37.040> to

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the ball from one side all the way to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.760 
the ball from one side all the way to
the<00:04:37.820> other<00:04:37.940> now<00:04:38.690> after<00:04:39.260> we've<00:04:39.380> done<00:04:39.590> that

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
we're going to take diagonal strings and

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.860 
we're going to take diagonal strings and
we're<00:04:43.040> going<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.220> fill<00:04:43.610> in<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.240> spaces<00:04:44.540> on

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
we're going to fill in the spaces on

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.340 
we're going to fill in the spaces on
each<00:04:45.020> side<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:46.040> give<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.600> entire<00:04:47.840> effect

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
each side to give it the entire effect

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.629 
each side to give it the entire effect
now<00:04:48.620> we're<00:04:48.770> going<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:48.950> use<00:04:49.040> our<00:04:49.160> paintbrush

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
now we're going to use our paintbrush

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.409 
now we're going to use our paintbrush
and<00:04:49.910> our<00:04:50.510> water<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:51.640> cover<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.760> cake<00:04:53.030> make<00:04:53.300> it

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
and our water to cover the cake make it

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.440 
and our water to cover the cake make it
sticking<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.260> our<00:04:54.530> strings<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.700> stick

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
sticking so that our strings of stick

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.440 
sticking so that our strings of stick
and<00:04:56.750> once<00:04:57.350> we've<00:04:57.500> done<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.220> we've

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
and once we've done that and we've

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.909 
and once we've done that and we've
smooth<00:04:59.450> it<00:04:59.600> all<00:04:59.750> down<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.289> should<00:05:00.410> give<00:05:00.560> us<00:05:00.590> our

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
smooth it all down it should give us our

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.890 
smooth it all down it should give us our
desired<00:05:01.340> effect

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.740 

that<00:05:04.470> we<00:05:04.620> have<00:05:04.800> our<00:05:05.160> finished<00:05:05.669> ball<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.360> yarn

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
that we have our finished ball of yarn

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.200 
that we have our finished ball of yarn
we've<00:05:07.350> added<00:05:07.650> all<00:05:07.949> of<00:05:08.100> our<00:05:08.250> strings<00:05:08.759> and<00:05:09.060> as

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
we've added all of our strings and as

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.090 
we've added all of our strings and as
you<00:05:09.360> can<00:05:09.509> tell<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:10.259> and<00:05:10.410> once<00:05:10.680> we've<00:05:10.830> gotten

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
you can tell here and once we've gotten

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.129 
you can tell here and once we've gotten

everything complete it really does look
like<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.530> ball<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.830> yarn<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:15.150> now<00:05:15.690> what<00:05:15.990> we<00:05:16.110> have

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
like a ball of yarn so now what we have

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.060 
like a ball of yarn so now what we have
left<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.620> do<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.449> make<00:05:18.449> our<00:05:18.630> cat<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.530> is<00:05:19.710> going

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
left to do is make our cat that is going

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.790 
left to do is make our cat that is going
to<00:05:20.310> our<00:05:20.520> top<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.210> our<00:05:21.720> cake<00:05:22.020> now<00:05:22.289> how<00:05:22.680> we're

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
to our top of our cake now how we're

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.070 
to our top of our cake now how we're
going<00:05:22.889> to<00:05:22.949> do<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.340> is<00:05:23.580> pretty<00:05:24.509> simple<00:05:24.930> pretty
