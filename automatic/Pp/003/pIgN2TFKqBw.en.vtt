00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the montel staff they have developed 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.429
 a much smaller loader than that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.179
 much lighter more compact and much more 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.570
 versatile because while it goes from 5 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.880
 practically up to 32 amps 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 and if from here on the question of loading 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 battery it goes from environment wants to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.680
 that is is a current and a battery 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 small motorcycle or a go-kart 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 then you select through this key 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 here then through this key here 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.390
 bike you go from a five battery 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.579
 theses up to a 22 amp battery 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.280
 if you have more than this you change the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.040
 key to the car option that the green 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.129
 and you have since a battery of 28 years 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.239
 to a battery of 100 amps 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.760
 in practice this here is a charger of 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.870
 environment up to 10 amps 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.520
 and you get there let's make an adjustment 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 much more accurate at the time of a load 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.500
 of a motorcycle battery mainly 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 battery is very easy to use. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 charger it already comes with these two 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.369
 bottles here I'll call first 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 The observation you should make is ok. 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.500
 Serigraphy of the product here is self 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.710
 explanatory 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.470
 here he has a little 110 220 volts 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.450
 It is the first observation that you have to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.479
 do is facilitate in the attention that you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 is using we are using the 110 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.049
 volts 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.840
 so I called correctly here I go 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.780
 leave both in the minimum current 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.250
 Do you select which car or motorcycle? 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.619
 in case we will charge your battery 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.680
 greater by car 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 so where's my my team all the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.890
 same motive the porter he is despite 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.780
 to be connected it is not with the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.659
 I put the two 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 points and he is not giving the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.909
 no inverted polarity or anything 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.159
 and why because it is one it has a relief and 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.869
 protection inside and if this 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.890
 loaders will only have the output of it 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.340
 released 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.990
 The moment you call is the claws. 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.730
 Attention equal to 8 volts or greater 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 arriving here inverted and I will do everything 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.870
 what I that which contradicts common sense but 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.000
 which the manufacturer says I can do 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.020
 So I'm going to turn one thing upside down. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.530
 would blow up any charger tabajara 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.550
 that there is a very strong led there 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.640
 reverse polarity 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.200
 It's so then he realized that I did 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.970
 a big bullshit in the place of me 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.970
 gift with a ball of fire he gave me 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.590
 gift with a small red led 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.660
 signaling my lack of reasoning 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.390
 so I'll call him right now 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.100
 here is a spout here because it is 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.260
 as this charged battery might not 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.190
 show up for a long time 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.200
 hello people, I do not know if they showed up there anymore 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.200
 What do you hear, the little boy, docking? 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.170
 hello load loading then it will stay 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.770
 in this situation whether it is by car or 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.750
 motorcycle until the moment it is 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.250
 fully charged we will go 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.460
 show on the video but when it is 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.890
 and will fully charged CILAD 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.150
 Delete and this one will switch to indicating 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.100
 that the battery is charged as you 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.010
 there is only one charger here and he only 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.620
 works on shows that bianca only 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.210
 works on only active yet 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.980
 after you called on the drums and I 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.290
 I realized that you can do something. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 carlos colla shows that he's guides 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.940
 entered the float, ie the battery 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.890
 is fully charged 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:49.770
 now if I let the carts out of here 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:53.310
 Look what's going to happen now, have 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.430
 attention promised by the manufacturer or 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.140
 whether I want to use with a font 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.870
 What can I do, I can fool the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.680
 charger, can I call him? 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.840
 momentarily on a battery you go 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.470
 attack the king you use as a 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.480
 front 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.370
 Now I'm going to tell you about it. It 's bianca vai. 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.510
 get closer here as he is 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.510
 completely safe 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.530
 Hello, it's okay since you've already changed the king and 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.750
 this was the choice you saw is normal 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.600
 because I should not have given a short 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.930
 It is now if I come here to measure 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.830
 voltage it's zero again 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.390
 shows an anka multimeter reminding you 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.040
 that the tolerance of movement that is not 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.520
 from nasa it sucks 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.200
 I 'm going back here and I'll call Bianca. 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.850
 will show bm f in the charger 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.370
 the ready docking kid and he's 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:55.540
 reloading then this charger 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:59.000
 is proof of mistakes as we have already 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.460
 Attested there, binding the inverted claws 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.980
 shorting the two claws when 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.560
 I staff Monthal gave me this 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.870
 charger and spoke no but put the 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.680
 claws this will counteract the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.960
 honey 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.550
 let's say even knowing that there is a 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.240
 protection circuit I do not like to do 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.670
 But if it's from here, I did it because 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.640
 simply if not you do not show the 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.800
 level of protection that the product has a 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.040
 Thank you so much for coming 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.040
 videos
