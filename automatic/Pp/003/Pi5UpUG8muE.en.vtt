00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.370 
character to kill and even if you're
playing<00:04:27.300> an<00:04:27.389> objective<00:04:27.750> game<00:04:27.930> type<00:04:28.139> there<00:04:28.320> are

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
playing an objective game type there are

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.600 
playing an objective game type there are
a<00:04:28.409> lot<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.590> people<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.009> have<00:04:29.070> that<00:04:29.340> kind<00:04:29.580> of

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
a lot of people that have that kind of

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.670 
a lot of people that have that kind of
mentality<00:04:29.759> so<00:04:30.719> because<00:04:31.169> of<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.409> fact<00:04:31.590> that

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
mentality so because of the fact that

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.740 
mentality so because of the fact that
you're<00:04:31.889> locking<00:04:32.099> down<00:04:32.400> area<00:04:32.880> your<00:04:33.539> team<00:04:33.719> can

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
you're locking down area your team can

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.629 
you're locking down area your team can
see<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.380> okay<00:04:34.680> well<00:04:34.860> there's<00:04:35.010> no<00:04:35.219> one<00:04:35.400> here

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
see that okay well there's no one here

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.270 
see that okay well there's no one here
this<00:04:35.849> like<00:04:36.210> let's<00:04:36.479> say<00:04:36.630> mr.<00:04:37.349> bio<00:04:37.529> is<00:04:37.770> locking

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
this like let's say mr. bio is locking

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.070 
this like let's say mr. bio is locking
this<00:04:38.460> area<00:04:38.790> I'm<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.510> go<00:04:39.570> ahead<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.810> push

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
this area I'm going to go ahead and push

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.930 
this area I'm going to go ahead and push
so<00:04:40.440> this<00:04:40.860> kind<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.190> helped<00:04:41.340> out<00:04:41.430> my<00:04:41.580> team<00:04:41.790> in

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
so this kind of helped out my team in

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.730 
so this kind of helped out my team in
the<00:04:42.030> end<00:04:42.180> because<00:04:42.330> we<00:04:42.600> got<00:04:42.720> some<00:04:42.990> fly<00:04:43.200> caps<00:04:43.530> off

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
the end because we got some fly caps off

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.610 
the end because we got some fly caps off
of<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.270> because<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.300> fact<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.050> was<00:04:46.380> pushing

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
of it because of fact that I was pushing

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.950 
of it because of fact that I was pushing
up<00:04:46.830> slowly<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.340> locking<00:04:47.850> down<00:04:48.000> area<00:04:48.450> they

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
up slowly and locking down area they

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.450 
up slowly and locking down area they
just<00:04:49.169> decided<00:04:49.560> okay<00:04:49.950> well<00:04:50.130> there's<00:04:50.280> nothing

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
just decided okay well there's nothing

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.580 
just decided okay well there's nothing
here<00:04:50.790> no<00:04:50.970> action<00:04:51.389> is<00:04:51.570> going<00:04:51.810> down<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.260> area

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
here no action is going down in the area

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.930 
here no action is going down in the area
let's<00:04:52.800> go<00:04:52.919> ahead<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.160> just<00:04:53.340> move<00:04:53.580> up<00:04:53.700> and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
let's go ahead and just move up and

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.730 
let's go ahead and just move up and
actually<00:04:54.120> find<00:04:54.660> something<00:04:55.139> that's<00:04:55.290> going<00:04:55.500> on

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740

and a couple of them actually pulled the

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.720 
and a couple of them actually pulled the
flag<00:04:57.600> now<00:04:58.470> moving<00:04:58.740> on<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.010> pretty<00:04:59.490> much<00:04:59.550> the

flag now moving on to pretty much the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.159 
flag now moving on to pretty much the
last<00:04:59.760> tip<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.270> have<00:05:00.480> for<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:00.960> your

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
last tip that I have for you is your

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.600 
last tip that I have for you is your
score<00:05:01.470> streaks<00:05:01.800> make<00:05:02.040> sure<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.460> pick

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
score streaks make sure that you pick

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.700 
score streaks make sure that you pick
these<00:05:02.760> very<00:05:03.090> carefully<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.870> make<00:05:04.290> sure<00:05:04.350> that

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
these very carefully and make sure that

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.610 
these very carefully and make sure that
they<00:05:04.860> are<00:05:04.889> primarily<00:05:05.639> helping<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.389> not<00:05:07.260> so

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
they are primarily helping you not so

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.960 
they are primarily helping you not so
much<00:05:07.830> your<00:05:07.980> team<00:05:08.190> because<00:05:08.490> if<00:05:08.639> your<00:05:08.760> team<00:05:08.940> is

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
much your team because if your team is

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.550 
much your team because if your team is
less<00:05:09.210> capable<00:05:09.419> than<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.900> not<00:05:10.200> quite<00:05:10.380> as

less capable than you not quite as
familiar<00:05:10.800> with<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.340> game<00:05:11.630> chances<00:05:12.630> are<00:05:12.780> if

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
familiar with the game chances are if

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.480 
familiar with the game chances are if
you<00:05:13.050> throw<00:05:13.290> up<00:05:13.380> a<00:05:13.440> UAV<00:05:13.710> they're<00:05:14.070> not<00:05:14.220> really

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
you throw up a UAV they're not really

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.400 
you throw up a UAV they're not really
gonna<00:05:14.610> know<00:05:14.880> what<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.210> does<00:05:15.419> or<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:16.020> know<00:05:16.230> how

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410

advantage and how that really get the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.340 
advantage and how that really get the
most<00:05:20.430> out<00:05:20.790> of<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.240> out<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.810> little<00:05:21.990> spy

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
most out of that out of that little spy

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.010 
most out of that out of that little spy
plane<00:05:22.650> up<00:05:22.830> in<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.070> air<00:05:23.360> so<00:05:24.360> make<00:05:24.600> sure<00:05:24.630> that

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
plane up in the air so make sure that

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.080 
plane up in the air so make sure that
your<00:05:25.140> your<00:05:25.590> kill<00:05:25.890> streaks<00:05:26.220> are<00:05:26.430> catered

your your kill streaks are catered

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.930 
your your kill streaks are catered
toward<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.140> but<00:05:28.740> also<00:05:28.919> make<00:05:29.280> sure<00:05:29.310> that<00:05:29.520> your

killstreaks<00:05:30.450> aren't<00:05:30.720> insanely<00:05:31.080> high<00:05:31.380> because

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
killstreaks aren't insanely high because

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.100 
killstreaks aren't insanely high because
like<00:05:31.950> I<00:05:32.070> said<00:05:32.130> before<00:05:32.370> if<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:33.300> fall<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:33.690> don't

like I said before if you fall you don't

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.480 
like I said before if you fall you don't
have<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.410> or<00:05:34.560> if<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.770> get<00:05:34.950> rush<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.340> don't

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
have it or if you get rush you don't

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.129 
have it or if you get rush you don't
really<00:05:35.610> have<00:05:35.880> these<00:05:36.150> teammates<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.810> back<00:05:36.960> you

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
really have these teammates to back you

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.600 
really have these teammates to back you
up<00:05:37.169> because<00:05:37.440> they<00:05:37.710> aren't<00:05:37.860> very<00:05:38.100> good<00:05:38.190> at<00:05:38.370> the

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
up because they aren't very good at the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.700 
up because they aren't very good at the
game<00:05:38.639> you<00:05:39.479> want<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.750> make<00:05:39.870> sure<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.380> while

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
game you want to make sure that while

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.530 
game you want to make sure that while
you're<00:05:40.919> holding<00:05:41.130> your<00:05:41.400> own<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.820> can<00:05:41.850> gain<00:05:42.270> all

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
you're holding your own you can gain all

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.510 
you're holding your own you can gain all
of<00:05:42.690> your<00:05:42.840> kill<00:05:43.110> streaks<00:05:43.440> don't<00:05:44.070> try<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:44.340> go

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
of your kill streaks don't try and go

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.130 
of your kill streaks don't try and go
for<00:05:44.550> something<00:05:44.970> like<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.390> swarm<00:05:45.780> when<00:05:46.020> you

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
for something like the swarm when you

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.870 
for something like the swarm when you
don't<00:05:46.380> have<00:05:46.560> very<00:05:46.770> good<00:05:46.919> teammates<00:05:47.490> because<00:05:47.700> I

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
don't have very good teammates because I

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.909 
don't have very good teammates because I
can<00:05:48.180> guarantee<00:05:48.690> that<00:05:48.900> you're<00:05:49.290> not<00:05:49.500> going<00:05:49.800> to

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
can guarantee that you're not going to

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
you know most people don't run blind

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.000 
you know most people don't run blind
eyes<00:06:03.900> so<00:06:04.110> that's<00:06:04.289> going<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.500> nail<00:06:04.680> them<00:06:04.800> right

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
eyes so that's going to nail them right

in<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.190> butt<00:06:05.370> counter<00:06:06.360> UAV<00:06:06.539> I<00:06:06.840> was<00:06:07.140> running

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
in the butt counter UAV I was running

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.840 
in the butt counter UAV I was running
all<00:06:07.590> three<00:06:07.830> of<00:06:07.890> those<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:08.130> worked<00:06:08.490> out<00:06:08.640> really

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
all three of those and worked out really

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.279 
all three of those and worked out really
really<00:06:08.970> well<00:06:09.210> because<00:06:09.570> most<00:06:09.960> people<00:06:10.260> don't

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
really well because most people don't

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.920 
really well because most people don't
run<00:06:10.560> hardwired<00:06:11.130> either<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:11.760> you<00:06:11.970> know<00:06:12.240> they're

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.250 
not countering against the counter UAV
they<00:06:14.940> have<00:06:15.030> they<00:06:15.240> have<00:06:15.330> no<00:06:15.479> way<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.690> block<00:06:16.020> it

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
they have they have no way to block it
