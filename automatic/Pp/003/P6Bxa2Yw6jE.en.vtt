00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.699
 this is a big car behind me toyota 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.489
 highlander 2014 year and what we do with 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.969
 with large machines we test correctly 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 maximum in terms of appearance 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.930
 It may seem to many that the car has become 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 less though if you look technical 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.269
 specifications 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.030
 2014 model has become longer and wider 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:04.500
 why do people buy themselves this spacious 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.320
 salon and of course in the trunk so 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.600
 It happened that in the automotive industry 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.130
 trunk measured by dry numbers 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.610
 so the boot is in test drives check 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.950
 winews 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:22.679
 they do not measure themselves out of 21 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 units 2 and a half agree good 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.020
 indicator and since we are today 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.050
 We are testing a complete set of limited engine 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.110
 three and a half liters 270 horsepower 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.210
 and in the configuration and available engine 2 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.330
 and 7 liters 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.939
 185 horsepower 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.939
 big trials went 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 I declare with full responsibility toyota 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:07.259
 highlander tests passed 3 s 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 half a liter would you see faces 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619
 surrounding 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.500
 and not only goes but also sounds 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.480
 and the first thing that comes to my mind when 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.480
 I want to tell you about the salon 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.120
 it is comfort and how do you get in a car 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.180
 the seat supports your back as comfortable 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.819
 put your hands how well they hold onto 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.099
 steering wheel 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.530
 Separately want to note the braking when 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.959
 you press the brake pedal all the way 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.660
 even if the car is in the snow 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:48.670
 you instantly stops of course 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.130
 did you buy a Toyota? 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.130
 it will be an economical car and by the way 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.269
 say we were not mistaken 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.049

 the city and 24 on the highway buying saves you 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.299
 it is assumed that there will be 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.010
 enough space and it's true here 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.709

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.750
