00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:21.860
 I am a dreamer why 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.730
 in the original these down from sweep it away 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.730
 especially fate such 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.940
 special item which 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.940
 hold tires 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.790
 footwear 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.690
 it happens very often 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.690
 cross equipment 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.790
 that spiked very well clings to 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.150
 priming 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.150
 powerful 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.390
 deer and pressure on the lid there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.020
 we 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.020
 fine-tuning 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.080
 83 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.810
 little long 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.210
 just tearing 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.650
 something Komi 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.840
 I will not show 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.440
 buy boils front wheel i set 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440
 such a thing 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.170
 is written 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.320
 we have written a wheel size of 185 by 12. 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.619
 width 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.619
 185 inches 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.520
 12 it 's like 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.630
 covers which 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 exactly the same on 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.630
 axle box so it is designed for 185 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.080
 by samples 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.780
 when the procedure is to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.150
 remove the tire 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 drill a hole 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.600
 put the boxer put the tank handle and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.640
 getting ready to work principle is not very 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.920
 lot 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.380
 holes against the boxer set through 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.830
 4 needles 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:36.540
 1 2 3 4 why not in this place 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:40.730
 I know because so on kawasaki 65 85 cm 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.050
 85 kawasaki 400 and kawasaki 250 shorter 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.290
 most cross-country motorcycles 9 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.350
 done exactly like this after 4 knitting needles why 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.370
 I do not know the opposite though on Honda 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.310
 done almost the opposite for example 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.930
 let's do it as a rollout 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.530
 does in the end yes how are the best 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:08.580
 world samples will say so well 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.850
 all here I drilled a hole like this 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.330
 our opponent Satar becomes 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.100
 that is, here are the edges of this place 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.450
 he pulls on the tire 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.870
 so gum, I'm this one 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.489
 native broke which protects 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.170
 camera from the nipple spokes all athletes in 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.680
 one voice says you just need 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.200
 plain electrical tape winding a few 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.360
 layers it will be much better than here 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.310
 it's gum 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.150
 so now wrap tape and 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.150
 Generally all 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.130
 assemble in the reverse order 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.130
 so that the hats are not rusted and and 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.330
 then you could pull up the needles 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.380
 there was a pull 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.880
 about sprinkling everything now 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.850
 grease for chain I'm on 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.080
 penetrates well and protect our caps 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.080
 against corrosion 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.360
 rust 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.840
 for any technique we are not a cat 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.930
 do not think that you just buy yourself 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.810
 expensive motorcycle and you will be on it 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.740
 have a ride have you not serve 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.740
 don't care for him 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.460
 and 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.460
 trying to unleash 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.760
 it was not clear what is always necessary 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.020
 when I loved for myself, I must try 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.790
 video 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.650
 beautiful 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.389
 everything was neatly blurred 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.680
 that it was always possible to twist 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.680
 pulled build 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.570
 technology will not fail 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.370
 any extreme situation 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:21.819
 yes we all put in place the tire 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:25.259
 well that's all our wheel is ready after 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.259
 tire fitting on only 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:40.690
 tighten the boxing nut against the taro box 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:42.599
 so she squeezed the tire and all you need 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.560
 to put 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:55.349
 pressure 1 kilogram I pumped you can 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.349
 set to go raise for
