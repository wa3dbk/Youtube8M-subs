00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 he comes to greet all worry 6th marmot 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.730
 pollute and today we are going 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.509
 find for the first episode of a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.790
 new Serie 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.320
 until then unpublished I think it will be 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 name clash of noise 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.519
 so this is a series a goal really 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.279
 humorous do not take it bad if 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.990
 you play like that I prefer to prevent 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.609
 and excuse me if there are any 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 profanity in some of his 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.210
 videos I do not think in this video 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 Anyway, it's really a series to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.449
 humorous goal where I'm going to put myself 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.010
 in the shoes of a doubt 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.900
 so that is someone who does not know 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.610
 not play flank clash and so i'm going 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.130
 make a parody of this new in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 hoping to make you laugh 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.829
 so I repeat again this is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.170
 really humorous 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.280
 so do not take it badly it's 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.789
 gone for this first episode in the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 section I like when I'm going to swing a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 fate of sohaib to nancy to make up there they 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.120
 will skip his walls he can 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 take this water reserve in this is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.910
 that I mistake the attacker did not do well 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.739
 studied the village he did not see indeed 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 that there were two towers of hell in 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 multiple mode what makes all and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.439
 goblins were killed without touching a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.479
 only once this reserve 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.880
 so much to say that it's really a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.189
 attack does the following words in 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.619
 the institution say any clan I'm going 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 swing everything but sorcerers in one 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.740
 group 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.780
 they will do damage and will make you tremble 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.430
 defenses 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.430
 yes I will do the 3 and right 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.829
 next 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.960
 I'm going to surround my city hall 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.210
 full of walls and I will put my 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.819
 defenses around like that and he does not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.060
 will not take my city hall and all 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.640
 my resources will be looted it's a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.459
 serious mistake because indeed this guy does not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 will not be able to quickly improve 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.689
 village and it's frankly not useful 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.219
 in fact to put walls on 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.259
 three thick because two breaks 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.200
 level 5 bricks and sei es 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.270
 flushed to the next after saving 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 full black delirium after finally 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 waited to have the pigs 5 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.780
 I can finally attack it beat all the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.950
 world with all the power 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.930
 riders go there trade this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.819
 attack who want have manhandled excuse 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 me for the previous excitement but he 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.940
 really had to set the tone for 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.940
 this video finally short this attack is 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.980
 really manhandled there is a not even had 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.290
 well-placed healing spells and more 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 used some kind of rage it's really 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.609
 not useful when using 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 riders more he did not empty the 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.269
 clan castle what brought him 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.790
 harm because indeed all the archers 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.380
 have cleaned up his flying rider this 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.400
 regarding his videos do not hesitate to 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.200
 to leave a green thumb I hope it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.200
