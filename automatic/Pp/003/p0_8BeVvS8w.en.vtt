00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
have

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.850 
have
it's<00:05:21.630> like<00:05:21.930> gone<00:05:22.400> hmm<00:05:23.840> did<00:05:24.840> you<00:05:24.960> find<00:05:25.199> more<00:05:25.440> no

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
it's like gone hmm did you find more no

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.400 
it's like gone hmm did you find more no
she's<00:05:26.220> been<00:05:26.580> like<00:05:27.090> for<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.389> last<00:05:27.600> two<00:05:27.870> day<00:05:28.050> she

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
she's been like for the last two day she

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.090 
she's been like for the last two day she
hasn't<00:05:28.770> been<00:05:28.889> finding<00:05:29.310> anything<00:05:29.630> that's<00:05:30.630> good

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
hasn't been finding anything that's good

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.100 
hasn't been finding anything that's good
so<00:05:32.100> I<00:05:32.130> think<00:05:32.430> total<00:05:33.120> she's<00:05:33.330> had<00:05:33.479> three<00:05:33.720> or<00:05:33.930> four

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
so I think total she's had three or four

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.860 
so I think total she's had three or four
treatments<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:36.360> know<00:05:36.449> Tiffany's

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
treatments and you know Tiffany's

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.930 
treatments and you know Tiffany's
checking<00:05:37.229> she's<00:05:37.590> been<00:05:37.740> very<00:05:38.100> thorough<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.550> I

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
checking she's been very thorough and I

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.820 
checking she's been very thorough and I
don't<00:05:39.120> know<00:05:39.240> if<00:05:39.389> that's<00:05:39.600> like<00:05:40.169> most<00:05:40.590> people

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
don't know if that's like most people

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.170 
don't know if that's like most people
aren't<00:05:40.949> this<00:05:41.160> thorough<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.820> so<00:05:41.910> that's<00:05:42.060> why

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
aren't this thorough and so that's why

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.850 
aren't this thorough and so that's why
like<00:05:42.870> after<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.229> couple<00:05:43.380> treatments<00:05:43.770> they'll

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
like after a couple treatments they'll

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.030 
like after a couple treatments they'll
find<00:05:44.190> anymore<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.820> or<00:05:45.449> if<00:05:45.870> she<00:05:46.650> just<00:05:46.680> had<00:05:46.919> that

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
find anymore and or if she just had that

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.150 
find anymore and or if she just had that
