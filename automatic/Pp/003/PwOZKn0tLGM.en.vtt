go into the deck profile but i'm going

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.240 
go into the deck profile but i'm going
to<00:00:11.429> really<00:00:12.120> try<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.389> get<00:00:12.660> into<00:00:12.929> Dark<00:00:13.799> Worlds<00:00:13.980> a

then it's completely dead and then this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.969 
then it's completely dead and then this
one<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.780> playing<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.259> over<00:01:55.619> each

gates<00:03:31.919> on<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.069> field<00:03:32.310> but<00:03:32.849> another<00:03:33.690> thing<00:03:34.019> is

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
gates on the field but another thing is

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.699 
gates on the field but another thing is
let's<00:03:35.549> say<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:37.560> actually<00:03:38.160> have<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.579> brow<00:03:39.709> over

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
let's say you actually have a brow over

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.020 
let's say you actually have a brow over
here<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.130> remove<00:03:41.430> from<00:03:41.730> play<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:44.819> is

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
here and you remove from play so this is

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.690 
here and you remove from play so this is
this<00:03:45.389> was<00:03:45.599> a<00:03:45.630> pretty<00:03:45.840> good<00:03:45.959> play<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.519> have

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
this was a pretty good play but you have

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.150 
this was a pretty good play but you have
to<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.389> adjust<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.959> combo<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.099> you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
to you have to adjust the combo so you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.339 
to you have to adjust the combo so you
have<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.639> brow<00:03:50.849> removed<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.329> play<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.169> that's

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
have a brow removed from play so that's

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.319 
have a brow removed from play so that's
very<00:03:52.440> good<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:53.310> instead<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.849> doing<00:03:54.030> what<00:03:54.269> I

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
very good so instead of doing what I

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.180 
very good so instead of doing what I
just<00:03:54.630> did<00:03:54.930> instead<00:03:55.500> you're<00:03:55.709> going<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.889> summon

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
just did instead you're going to summon

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.309 
just did instead you're going to summon
the<00:03:56.280> tour<00:03:56.489> guide<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.030> you're<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.109> go

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
the tour guide and you're going to go

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.539 
the tour guide and you're going to go
into<00:03:58.940> brown<00:03:59.940> but<00:04:00.840> you're<00:04:01.799> going<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.010> overlay

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
into brown but you're going to overlay

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.619 
into brown but you're going to overlay
and<00:04:02.790> then<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:05.220> pretend<00:04:05.639> this<00:04:05.819> is<00:04:06.060> levy<00:04:06.540> or

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
and then just pretend this is levy or

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.349 
and then just pretend this is levy or
not<00:04:07.079> Leviathan<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.459> now<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.760> have<00:04:08.849> levy<00:04:09.180> air

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
not Leviathan so now you have levy air

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.020 
not Leviathan so now you have levy air
on<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.599> field<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.190> 1800<00:04:11.190> instead<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:11.910> that

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
on the field so 1800 instead of that

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.150 
on the field so 1800 instead of that
1000<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:13.260> can<00:04:13.410> detach<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:16.590> special<00:04:17.010> summon

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
1000 you can detach to special summon

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.930 
1000 you can detach to special summon
that<00:04:17.549> removed<00:04:17.970> from<00:04:18.209> play<00:04:18.829> brow<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.760> can

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
that removed from play brow then you can

bounce this brow back to your hand and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.140 
bounce this brow back to your hand and
have<00:04:24.890> graph<00:04:25.890> on<00:04:26.070> your<00:04:26.280> field<00:04:26.460> so

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
have graph on your field so

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.670 
have graph on your field so
this<00:04:27.330> will<00:04:27.479> be<00:04:27.570> 11<00:04:27.750> year<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.139> one<00:04:28.320> thousand

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
this will be 11 year so one thousand

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.290 
this will be 11 year so one thousand
eight<00:04:28.740> hundred<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.160> two<00:04:29.759> thousand<00:04:30.180> seven

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
eight hundred and two thousand seven

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.480 
eight hundred and two thousand seven
hundred<00:04:30.479> which<00:04:31.199> is<00:04:31.410> much<00:04:31.650> better<00:04:31.919> even<00:04:32.160> if<00:04:32.370> you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
hundred which is much better even if you

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.490 
hundred which is much better even if you
have<00:04:32.610> gates<00:04:32.850> on<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.120> field<00:04:33.300> 1800<00:04:34.229> is<00:04:34.320> still

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
have gates on the field 1800 is still

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.159 
have gates on the field 1800 is still
more<00:04:34.680> than<00:04:34.880> 1,300<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.090> that's<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:36.870> one<00:04:37.020> of

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
more than 1,300 so that's just one of

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.779 
more than 1,300 so that's just one of
the<00:04:37.320> different<00:04:38.009> combos<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.580> can<00:04:38.699> do

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
the different combos that you can do

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.300 
the different combos that you can do
that<00:04:38.970> are<00:04:39.090> good<00:04:39.800> another<00:04:40.800> thing<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.100> I'm

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
that are good another thing that I'm

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.610 
that are good another thing that I'm
going<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.699> go<00:04:41.820> into<00:04:41.970> now<00:04:42.210> this<00:04:42.419> isn't<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.900> combo

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
going to go into now this isn't a combo

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.360 
going to go into now this isn't a combo
but<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.729> when<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.630> use<00:04:47.270> your<00:04:48.270> trap<00:04:49.370> Debbie

bring<00:06:17.880> them<00:06:18.000> out<00:06:18.090> again<00:06:18.620> then<00:06:19.620> you're<00:06:19.800> not

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
bring them out again then you're not

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.129 
bring them out again then you're not
going<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.430> want<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.639> activate<00:06:21.139> devastation

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
going to want to activate devastation

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.779 
going to want to activate devastation
unless<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.590> know<00:06:22.800> it'll<00:06:23.039> wreck<00:06:23.280> their<00:06:23.460> entire

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
unless you know it'll wreck their entire

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.520 
unless you know it'll wreck their entire
hand<00:06:24.440> so<00:06:25.729> that's<00:06:26.840> probably<00:06:27.840> all<00:06:28.080> we're<00:06:28.349> going

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
hand so that's probably all we're going

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.839 
hand so that's probably all we're going
to<00:06:28.590> go<00:06:28.740> into<00:06:28.770> right<00:06:29.250> now<00:06:29.310> yeah<00:06:31.580> but<00:06:32.580> I'll<00:06:32.699> try

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
to go into right now yeah but I'll try

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.610 
to go into right now yeah but I'll try
to<00:06:32.909> I'll<00:06:33.180> try<00:06:33.360> to<00:06:33.419> portion<00:06:33.870> these<00:06:34.020> videos<00:06:34.380> out

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
to I'll try to portion these videos out

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.950 
to I'll try to portion these videos out
and<00:06:34.889> get<00:06:35.820> a<00:06:35.849> better<00:06:36.060> understanding<00:06:36.180> next<00:06:36.810> time

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
and get a better understanding next time

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.690 
and get a better understanding next time
we'll<00:06:37.169> probably<00:06:37.469> talk<00:06:37.919> about<00:06:38.190> the<00:06:38.340> different

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
we'll probably talk about the different

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700 
we'll probably talk about the different
