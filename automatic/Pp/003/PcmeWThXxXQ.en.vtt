quick and easy way to temper chocolate
at<00:00:16.619> home<00:00:16.880> tempering<00:00:17.880> chocolate<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.840> a

at home tempering chocolate is kind of a
fancy<00:00:19.289> term<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.740> bringing<00:00:20.520> chocolate<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> the

fancy term for bringing chocolate to the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.490 
fancy term for bringing chocolate to the
right<00:00:21.300> temperature<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.230> when<00:00:22.380> it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
right temperature so that when it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.920 
right temperature so that when it
hardens<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.160> sets<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.609> you're<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:24.480> left<00:00:24.779> with

hardens and sets up you're not left with
the<00:00:25.170> gray<00:00:25.529> streaks<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> white<00:00:26.640> streaks

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the gray streaks or the white streaks

the gray streaks or the white streaks
that<00:00:27.240> sometimes<00:00:27.660> happen<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.140> chocolate<00:00:28.470> that

that sometimes happen on chocolate that
isn't<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> right<00:00:29.279> temperature<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.199> sounds

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
isn't the right temperature it sounds

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.979 
isn't the right temperature it sounds
complicated<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> promise<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
complicated but I promise it's not so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
of chocolate and I'm going to start by

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.190 
of chocolate and I'm going to start by
chopping<00:00:46.469> about<00:00:47.039> 2/3<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:47.940> chocolate<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
chopping about 2/3 of that chocolate to

chopping about 2/3 of that chocolate to
melt

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.570 

okay<00:00:55.200> so<00:00:55.260> I've<00:00:55.530> coarsely<00:00:56.010> chopped<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
okay so I've coarsely chopped the

okay so I've coarsely chopped the
chocolate<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.030> we're<00:00:57.240> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> start<00:00:57.780> by

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
chocolate that we're going to start by

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.320 
chocolate that we're going to start by
melting<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.950> other<00:00:59.220> remaining<00:00:59.880> third<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
melting the other remaining third of

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.420 
melting the other remaining third of
chocolate<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:01.080> haven't<00:01:01.650> chopped<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.130> I'm<00:01:02.280> going

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
chocolate I haven't chopped it I'm going

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830 
chocolate I haven't chopped it I'm going
to<00:01:02.490> show<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.700> what<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.330> that<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.630> just

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to show you what to do with that in just

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
to show you what to do with that in just
a<00:01:03.960> second<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.500> let's<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.890> started<00:01:05.220> melting

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
a second but let's get started melting

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
a second but let's get started melting
this<00:01:05.730> chocolate<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.390> use<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> microwave<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
this chocolate I use the microwave and I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
this chocolate I use the microwave and I
usually<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.180> minute<00:01:09.330> spurts

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
usually do it in about one minute spurts

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
usually do it in about one minute spurts
at<00:01:10.110> 50%<00:01:10.830> power<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> chocolate

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
at 50% power so that the chocolate

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.649 
at 50% power so that the chocolate
doesn't<00:01:12.120> get<00:01:12.390> overheated

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.420 

you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.650 

now<00:01:27.430> once<00:01:27.880> your<00:01:28.090> chocolate<00:01:28.300> is<00:01:28.630> completely

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
now once your chocolate is completely

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.140 
now once your chocolate is completely
melted<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.680> smooth<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:30.370> going<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.730> be<00:01:30.850> warm

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
melted and smooth it's going to be warm

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.330 
melted and smooth it's going to be warm
to<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.390> touch<00:01:31.510> and<00:01:32.050> what<00:01:32.590> you're<00:01:32.740> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.190> do

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
to the touch and what you're going to do

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.850 
to the touch and what you're going to do
is<00:01:33.700> you're<00:01:33.880> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.210> take<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.870> last<00:01:35.230> third

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
is you're going to take that last third

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.890 
is you're going to take that last third
of<00:01:36.070> chocolate<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.820> didn't<00:01:37.270> get<00:01:37.360> added<00:01:37.780> to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
of chocolate that didn't get added to

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.870 
of chocolate that didn't get added to
the<00:01:38.050> bowl<00:01:38.230> originally<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.040> be<00:01:39.160> melted<00:01:39.550> and

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
the bowl originally to be melted and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.580 
the bowl originally to be melted and
you're<00:01:40.240> going<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.510> find<00:01:40.810> my<00:01:41.020> chocolate<00:01:41.470> which

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
you're going to find my chocolate which

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.340 
you're going to find my chocolate which
I've<00:01:41.770> already<00:01:42.010> done<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:43.090> chocolate<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.990> what

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
I've already done this chocolate is what

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.380 
I've already done this chocolate is what
gets<00:01:44.740> added<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.460> melted<00:01:45.790> chocolate<00:01:46.000> and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
gets added to the melted chocolate and

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.330 
gets added to the melted chocolate and
lowers<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:46.900> temperature<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.010> melted

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
lowers the temperature of the melted

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.700 
lowers the temperature of the melted
chocolate<00:01:48.520> which<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.600> essentially<00:01:50.200> tempering

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
chocolate which is essentially tempering

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.680 
chocolate which is essentially tempering
the<00:01:50.740> chocolate<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.520> when<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.030> sets<00:01:52.330> up<00:01:52.540> it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
the chocolate so that when it sets up it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.080 
the chocolate so that when it sets up it
doesn't<00:01:52.870> get<00:01:53.140> those<00:01:53.320> white<00:01:53.620> streaks<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.400> so

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
doesn't get those white streaks in it so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.970 
doesn't get those white streaks in it so
I'm<00:01:55.270> going<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.690> add<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.200> finely<00:01:56.560> chopped

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
I'm going to add this finely chopped

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.900 
I'm going to add this finely chopped
chocolate<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:01.270> my<00:02:01.450> melted<00:02:01.900> chocolate<00:02:02.380> and

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
chocolate to my melted chocolate and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.520
