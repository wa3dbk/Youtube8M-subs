update for the 1415 season the other
thing<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.770> we've<00:00:23.980> done<00:00:24.010> is<00:00:24.220> adjust<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:24.760> Flex

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
thing that we've done is adjust the Flex

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.609 
thing that we've done is adjust the Flex
on<00:00:25.240> this<00:00:25.420> ski<00:00:25.630> just<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.900> little<00:00:26.140> bit<00:00:26.260> from<00:00:26.380> last

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
on this ski just a little bit from last

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.150 
on this ski just a little bit from last
season

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
season

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.190 
season
we've<00:00:27.610> stiffened<00:00:28.150> up<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.390> shovel<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.930> ski

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
we've stiffened up the shovel of the ski

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.080 
we've stiffened up the shovel of the ski
and<00:00:29.410> that<00:00:29.830> gives<00:00:30.010> it<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.190> little<00:00:30.430> more<00:00:30.580> power<00:00:30.880> at

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
and that gives it a little more power at

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.580 
and that gives it a little more power at
initiation<00:00:31.570> at<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.840> beginning<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.379> turn

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
initiation at the beginning of the turn

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.440 
initiation at the beginning of the turn
and<00:00:33.100> then<00:00:33.220> we've<00:00:33.310> actually<00:00:33.460> softened<00:00:34.180> up<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
and then we've actually softened up the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.479 
and then we've actually softened up the
mid<00:00:34.630> body<00:00:34.840> of<00:00:35.050> ski<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.410> little<00:00:35.590> bit<00:00:35.800> what<00:00:36.310> that

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
mid body of ski a little bit what that

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:37.979 
mid body of ski a little bit what that
does<00:00:36.700> is<00:00:36.850> allow<00:00:37.060> the<00:00:37.120> ski<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.480> bend<00:00:37.750> through

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
does is allow the ski to bend through

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.780 
does is allow the ski to bend through
the<00:00:38.079> middle<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.470> turn<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.280> give<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:39.579> nice

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
the middle of a turn and give you nice

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.750 
the middle of a turn and give you nice
acceleration<00:00:40.210> pop<00:00:40.930> out<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.350> turn<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:42.310> RTM

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
acceleration pop out of the turn the RTM

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.420 
acceleration pop out of the turn the RTM
84<00:00:43.030> utilizes<00:00:43.930> our<00:00:44.079> extended<00:00:44.710> low-profile

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
84 utilizes our extended low-profile

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.220 
84 utilizes our extended low-profile
full<00:00:45.790> rocker<00:00:46.120> design<00:00:46.390> which<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:46.930> long

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
turn the whole edge is almost

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.200 
turn the whole edge is almost
immediately<00:00:53.649> on<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.010> snow<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.880> that<00:00:55.000> gives

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
immediately on the snow and that gives

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.000 
immediately on the snow and that gives

you a full edge contact going all the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.740 
you a full edge contact going all the
way<00:00:57.040> down<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.430> ski<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:58.210> gives<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.510> better

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
way down the ski it gives you better

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.139 
way down the ski it gives you better
edge<00:00:58.989> grip<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.500> better<00:00:59.680> control<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.850> unique

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
edge grip and better control the unique

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.369 
edge grip and better control the unique
thing<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.360> we<00:01:01.540> do<00:01:01.690> at<00:01:01.809> Volkl<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.260> our

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
thing that we do at Volkl with our

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.990 
thing that we do at Volkl with our
rocker<00:01:02.590> Designs<00:01:02.980> has<00:01:03.100> always<00:01:03.520> matched<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
rocker Designs has always matched the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.819 
rocker Designs has always matched the
Flex<00:01:04.329> and<00:01:04.539> side<00:01:04.959> cuts<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.409> rocker<00:01:05.619> design

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
Flex and side cuts of the rocker design

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.590 
Flex and side cuts of the rocker design
so<00:01:06.219> the<00:01:06.310> ski<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.639> always<00:01:07.030> performing<00:01:07.479> at

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
so the ski is always performing at

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.719 
so the ski is always performing at
perfect<00:01:08.020> harmony<00:01:08.229> just<00:01:09.159> like<00:01:09.310> in<00:01:09.459> the<00:01:09.549> past

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
perfect harmony just like in the past

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.029 
perfect harmony just like in the past
the<00:01:10.060> RTM<00:01:10.450> 84<00:01:10.719> has<00:01:11.109> our<00:01:11.289> dual<00:01:11.499> extended

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
the RTM 84 has our dual extended

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.980 
the RTM 84 has our dual extended
transmission<00:01:12.609> sidewall<00:01:13.179> construction<00:01:13.389> so

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
transmission sidewall construction so

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.870 
transmission sidewall construction so
it's<00:01:14.259> got<00:01:14.439> extra<00:01:14.799> material<00:01:15.399> over<00:01:15.639> the<00:01:15.670> edge

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
it's got extra material over the edge

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.179 
it's got extra material over the edge
for<00:01:16.179> added<00:01:16.479> support<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.109> then<00:01:17.619> a<00:01:17.649> sidewall

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
for added support and then a sidewall

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.440 
for added support and then a sidewall
underneath<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.759> also<00:01:18.969> gives<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.420> great

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
underneath that also gives you great

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.590 
underneath that also gives you great
edge<00:01:19.929> grip<00:01:19.959> the<00:01:20.889> RTM<00:01:21.279> 84<00:01:21.549> also<00:01:22.060> still<00:01:22.270> has<00:01:22.450> our
