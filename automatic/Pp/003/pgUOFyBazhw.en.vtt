00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.019
 good friends of saban in this 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.179
 I'm going to show you an application 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.919
 that I discovered recently and I thought 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.789
 pretty curious 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:32.309
 her name is helmut film scan 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.360
 and as its own name indicates it comes to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 be a scan a converter 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.930
 negative of digital photography to a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.059
 color photography the negatives are from 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.790
 this guy who are the negative that good 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.339
 because they did not return us once 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 the development of photography in 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.809
 any photographic laboratory and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.250
 I suppose that good you will have much that 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.799
 Well, you will not know how to use it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 that against this application and was 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.650
 doing a test and the truth is that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 you do not get data about a photograph 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.189
 as clear as if it were in the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.159
 laboratory obviously since we're going to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.030
 do the scanner directly from the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.700
 mobile camera but good 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.890
 can you get some photograph 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.530
 that you have lost 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.840
 in a simple and fast way 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.570
 because this application is totally 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.570
 I will not have to look for helmut 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.229
 google plane and well then there you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 will appear immediately 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.799
 this application we will do a test 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.380
 so you see let's go into the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.850
 application so you can see how to make 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.810
 the scanning process and such that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 well let's go 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 to see if this is the introduction of 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.450
 helmut and well then it gives us input 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 three options our the option of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.730
 scan in black and white a negative 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.709
 in black and white a negative in color or 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.300
 a positive in color is positive in 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.990
 color then it would be a good photograph 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.850
 normal revealed of all life for 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.870
 pass them to negative 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.370
 well well as this reel is these 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.720
 negative I have here are in color 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.740
 then we would give a negative color 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.360
 we would give him to capture with the camera and 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.360
 well then we would open the camera 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.520
 to see how 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.990
 this would be to put it on a 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.910
 white background for example if we have the 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.190
 computer well then we can 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.590
 put directly 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.879
 on the computer 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.390
 for example in google and like when in 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.270
 the radiography appears 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.800
 when the doctors on the x-ray that 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.100
 see it on a white background as 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.340
 Obviously you get a result 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.310
 much better I will place the camera for 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.690
 that can do the side thing at a time 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.390
 since I 'm holding on with the camera 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.630
 with your hand and you would have to scan it with 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.690
 the other one and now we see what the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.590
 scanning process of this simple 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.260
 application 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.140
 Well, as I told you about this 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.920
 white background is easier to perform 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.480
 Scanning and good because we will 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.930
 to proceed so you can see what it would be like 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.540
 Well, this mobile to start 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.960
 scan or it focuses pretty badly what 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.420
 first plane 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.470
 so you have to give it pretty good 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.470
 this is going to come out to the second 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.330
 we photographed 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.060
 the photograph or the negative and a 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.770
 Once we have photographed in negative the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.840
 application will give us the option to save 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.990
 the or to repeat it once 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.810
 captured is captured in negative the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.910
 whole of the negative and now good 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.019
 because helmut gives us the option of being able 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.550
 cut to our convenience in the 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.370
 part of the negative that we want 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.470
 that is the photograph we want 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.590
 get for this well then well 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.180
 we adjust it costs a bit to adjust it with 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.689
 this application the truth what is the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.649
 framework 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.429
 but well let's put it that way more or 

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:46.729
 less for the test is good and good 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:48.889
 now we accept it and we get the 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.959
 resulting image that would be this one that 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.119
 we have behind this notice that we 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:56.479
 says that in order to access the 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:59.090
 adjustments we should do as well as if 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.210
 we were expanding a photograph 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.289
 from the android gallery touches even the 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.889
 Gallery 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.830
 of them is the same gesture and 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.619
 here good because we access a fan 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.050
 of options like being able to choose the 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:17.419
 contrast that we could take it 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.210
 we would increase or reduce it from this 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.749
 way up or down the bar that 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.980
 we have here to the right and other types 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:29.400
 of settings like about him 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.550
 the white contrast in the balance 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.750
 white the balance 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:40.620
 the tone of the photograph in order then we 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.970
 Give some options to make it look good 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:48.090
 or better what photography is once 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.950
 let's finish doing this we access the 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.449
 This circle that gives us the different 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.240
 options and we give ex-chants 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.280
 right now it 's 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.110
 scanning let's say what is the 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.319
 photography is ending 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.690
 convert it and this would be the result 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:09.650
 Finally we see that it is not very clear either 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:13.120
 much less because I insist it is not done 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.160
 with the camera of the mobile we have also 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.080
 put we have put negative on the 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.400
 pc screen so here they look 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.430
 let's say some the pixels so 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.530
 say it from the screen so 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.889
 preferably we could do it on 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.199
 a blank screen or man his 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.849
 would be to have the device that has what 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.090
 doctor to see the x-ray but 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.819
 good and everyone who knew more or less 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.050
 look for your solution solutions for 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.849
 which comes out better and good for once 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:52.099
 here we can already 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:54.589
 save and this would be the result I 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:57.499
 I guess you could get better 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:01.009
 results and we use a scanner of the 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:04.459
 they bring the multifunction printer and 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:06.800
 well scanning it with that scanner 

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:09.379
 and saving the photograph on the mobile 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.330
 subsequently passing it around the world 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:15.860
 we could get an image 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:18.409
 much more clear I will try it and already 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.509
 put in the comments to see how it is 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.580
 the result but come on I guess that 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:25.580
 is much better than the one we have 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.539
 registered with the camera of the mobile that 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.539
 let's go that either 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.330
 becomes bad bad is acceptable is 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.560
 an application plus a utility more than 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.780
 we can give to our android mobile 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.980
 Well I found it funny and I 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.250
 I liked 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.990
 it seemed good to show you a greeting and 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.680
 see you in the next video of 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.680
 sants
