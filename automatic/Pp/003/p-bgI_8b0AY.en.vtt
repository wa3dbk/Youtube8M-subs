00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hey my life today i'll show you eight 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.370
 valuable tips for long healthy and 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.350
 nice Nails 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.929
 I start with the first tip and the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.690
 is called glasstadt metal parts the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.429
 metal parts is super smoke and so on 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.699
 later expensive nail therefore used 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.810
 just a glass of this much gentler 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.520
 i use an electronic 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650
 nail file this has three different ones 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 essays and there I am now directly 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 place the arrow cap on it and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.199
 I'll start falling 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.969
 always before I with my rest 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.730
 routine processes is therefore always come 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.610
 nice and fine or as it is with tip 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.200
 Number two would be to smooth out bumps 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 You can do that too with a file 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.930
 But do not make more than 15 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.030
 seconds 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 because from the moment you harm yours 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.059
 Therefore fog only about 15 seconds 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.340
 long 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 tip number three would be a cuticle 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 to give way and then push back 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 i just use a bowl now 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 with lukewarm water in it normally 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.969
 I just do that after showering 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.829
 and then I can actually do that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.840
 push the cuticle backwards 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.070
 you can actually do it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200
 prevent your merkel has become 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 somehow ignited and the nail becomes 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.420
 it is also much healthier and easier 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.570
 much more hygienic 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.299
 Tip number 4 would be the nail or 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.360
 generally maintain the nails with nail 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.580
 you simply care for the skin 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 around the nail all the finger 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.390
 teaching does not come to know either 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 or to dry nails so that would 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 I always recommend you I do 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 she always does that and I think 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 time since years that this is now the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 Circulation a bit furthered thereby 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.039
 my nails just grow it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.979
 maybe a tick family or just 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.460
 so children of jörg fun but I believe 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.880
 it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.649
 Tip 5 always apply a base code 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.990
 really always even if it is not 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.850
 and boring is the base short protects 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.429
 Your nail for the first time because that again 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.670
 such a layer of paint is and the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.709
 nail polish lasts longer and protects it 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.299
 the money will be too much 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.970
 Nail polish is also harmful 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.250
 Tip number six is ​​the big nail 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.769
 always to paint first he just has 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.720
 a larger area than the others and 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.580
 It also needed the longest dry season 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 therefore always starts in the in the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.420
 Pull the middle once and then pull 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.250
 each on the sides and you have yours 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.690
 Nail actually also painted perfectly 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.609
 and that's what I'm doing now 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.250
 all nails you now notice me 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.049
 lay over it a bit and blot and 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 make mistakes but immediately comes the 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.530
 next tip 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.170
 Tip number 7 is a cotton swab easy 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.230
 dunk in nail polish remover and with it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.350
 I just clean the pages 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 always press that on the skin and then 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.860
 I wish that a bit off 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 So you have the complete nail polish 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.180
 on the sides from the location looks great 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.560
 painted and you did not have that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.800
 a lot of stress when applying 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.570
 Tip number eight would always be the top coat 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.300
 firstly apply for a long time 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.220
 Second, a lasting result 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.830
 whole nail polish with simply by 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.860
 protected gets 1000 times longer or 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.100
 exaggerated but i just have to and that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.750
 whole it just starts the chemistry 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.920
 and then you have the perfect ones too 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 Nails I hope that you smooth 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.340
