00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:20.910 

I<00:00:17.580> always<00:00:18.580> try<00:00:18.820> to<00:00:18.880> go<00:00:19.060> for<00:00:19.390> big<00:00:19.930> volumous

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
I always try to go for big volumous

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.099 
I always try to go for big volumous
lashes<00:00:21.910> but<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.210> problem<00:00:22.539> is<00:00:22.660> is<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.990> in

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
lashes but the problem is is that in

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.939 
lashes but the problem is is that in
order<00:00:23.199> to<00:00:23.349> achieve<00:00:23.529> that<00:00:24.010> I<00:00:24.939> always<00:00:25.330> tend<00:00:25.779> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
order to achieve that I always tend to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.999 
order to achieve that I always tend to
layer<00:00:26.949> my<00:00:27.460> mascaras<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.480> apply<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.380> lot<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.769> lot

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
layer my mascaras and apply a lot a lot

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.100 
layer my mascaras and apply a lot a lot
a<00:00:30.070> lot<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.279> lot<00:00:30.369> of<00:00:30.640> coats<00:00:30.880> start<00:00:31.449> quite<00:00:31.929> long

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
a lot a lot of coats start quite long

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.440 
a lot a lot of coats start quite long
but<00:00:32.590> there's<00:00:33.160> not<00:00:33.340> enough<00:00:33.700> thickness<00:00:34.150> or

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
but there's not enough thickness or

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.090 
but there's not enough thickness or
volume<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.020> sometimes<00:00:35.530> it<00:00:35.740> just<00:00:35.920> goes

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
volume and sometimes it just goes

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.740 
volume and sometimes it just goes
straight<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.430> sort<00:00:36.670> of<00:00:36.730> flares<00:00:37.030> out<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.540> way

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
straight and sort of flares out that way

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.060 
straight and sort of flares out that way
I<00:00:37.990> like<00:00:38.500> volume<00:00:39.480> eyelashes<00:00:40.480> but<00:00:40.900> more<00:00:41.440> natural

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
I like volume eyelashes but more natural

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.430 
I like volume eyelashes but more natural
kind<00:00:42.400> of<00:00:42.670> not<00:00:43.210> sure<00:00:43.240> I<00:00:43.600> really<00:00:43.960> want<00:00:44.110> them<00:00:44.410> to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
kind of not sure I really want them to

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.170 
kind of not sure I really want them to
be<00:00:44.530> more<00:00:44.740> voluminous<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.790> want<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.090> be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
be more voluminous and I want it to be

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.700 
be more voluminous and I want it to be
longer<00:00:46.420> because<00:00:47.020> I<00:00:47.050> think<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.350> have<00:00:47.380> some

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
longer because I think I have some

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.190 
longer because I think I have some
pretty<00:00:47.920> short<00:00:48.160> lashes<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:48.730> have<00:00:49.450> ridiculously

pretty short lashes I have ridiculously
long<00:00:50.440> lashes<00:00:50.740> so<00:00:51.310> it's<00:00:51.520> really<00:00:51.850> difficult<00:00:52.120> for

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
long lashes so it's really difficult for

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.710 
long lashes so it's really difficult for
me<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:53.170> find<00:00:53.860> mascaras<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.580> doesn't<00:00:55.330> allow

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720
