enough more damage there we go I had

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.550 
enough more damage there we go I had
another<00:01:34.520> self-destruct<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.659> signature

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
another self-destruct there go signature

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.330 
another self-destruct there go signature
in<00:01:37.740> half<00:01:38.090> go<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> goal<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.189> as

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
in half go and the goal is just to do as

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
in half go and the goal is just to do as
much<00:01:41.729> damage<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:42.270> possible<00:01:42.329> damage<00:01:43.229> both<00:01:43.590> to

yourself and the environment as possible

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
yourself and the environment as possible
and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.590> make<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.189> money<00:01:47.490> it's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and then you make up more money it's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
and then you make up more money it's
some<00:01:47.790> sort<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> odd<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.630> controlled<00:01:49.380> chaos

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
some sort of odd it's a controlled chaos

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.300 
some sort of odd it's a controlled chaos
okay<00:01:51.090> sort<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> idea<00:01:52.040> give<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.280> more

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
okay sort of the idea give it one more

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.470 
okay sort of the idea give it one more
shot

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.000
