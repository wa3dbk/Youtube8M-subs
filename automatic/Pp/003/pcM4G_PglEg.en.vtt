 and today I 'm going to tell you something super 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.689
 interesting lately what happens to me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.910
 is that when you call me or I leave I go to 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.050
 to marry a client or just ask me 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.759
 advice the first thing you ask me is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.369
 what can I do to have in the closet 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.189
 well organized, well, today I'm going to

 have by mario well organized without 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.810
 need to drive you crazy and feel that 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's chaos early in the morning 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.460
 the million dollar question is what should I do 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.650
 to have a closet that does not produce me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
 horror when opening it and when 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.700
 to select good clothes because I today you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 As I was saying before, I'm going to give you five 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.230
 tips so you can use all your 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.250
 clothes and that your closet does not look like a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.100
 madness every time you open it 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.390
 the first of all is 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.280
 already said a lot of times and it's 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.530
 empty the closet and do a cleaning 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.810
 without mercy when I say without mercy is 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.810
 without mercy that is to say you have to empty the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.060
 wardrobe for clothes that I do not 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.710
 correspond by color we already know that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.360
 you have to know the palette first 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.580
 colors to which it belongs is by 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.410
 morphology you should know what 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.050
 morphology you have and what clothes do not you 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.060
 they favor physically and especially 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.590
 there are a lot of clothes and I 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.960
 I find many closets with clothes 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.710
 that really have a lot of time 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.869
 a garment 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.509
 does not meet any of those three 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.090
 circumstances goes outside yes or yes the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.250
 second and very important is to have the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.790
 doors all the same color though 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.650
 It may seem absurd 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.110
 and find many cabinets that have 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.780
 different dates because the typical thing you have 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.510
 I am a garment to the dry cleaner you 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.460
 they send with a type hanger like that and you 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.230
 what do you put in the closet good 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.510
 these hangers are prohibited gives me 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.600
 just as they are white green yellow 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.940
 or even metal this hanger tends to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.640
 distort the garment and my advice is that 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.350
 you use type dates so you can 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.360
 be white we are all white 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.240
 as they can be hangers that are also 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.340
 of wood color or darker my advice 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.160
 have the hangers all the same color 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.740
 with which this outside hanger and this 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.930
 hanger stays 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.750
 another super important factor at the time 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.670
 to have a wardrobe that is very visual and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.520
 that is very comfortable when choosing 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.130
 clothes is that you have everything in it 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 site I mean bags as you see 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.970
 well I show you a video I have them in 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.460
 the top part I refer to garments 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.400
 ok I have part here and part in the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.350
 another in the other part of the closet and I 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.780
 I mean add-ons and if they can already 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.850
 be shoes very much better all in the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.130
 same place so that when you will have the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.050
 wardrobe is very visual and you have a lot 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.050
 Accessibility to all garments 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 the fourth time and this is very 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.760
 and it is important that garments must 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.890
 be placed and everything has to have 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.850
 an order tots on the one hand is to say 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.250
 Tops Pants Pants 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.840
 shorts and long pants and in the other 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.000
 part of the closet I have dresses and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.660
 blazer very important to have it all 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 at a glance and take off keep this 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.739
 order I am that it costs you to hurry 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.000
 in our routine to our day to day 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.340
 they can do that at a certain moment 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.650
 we lose that order, well, dedicate it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.930
 a little bit of time that costs nothing 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.180
 to maintain order inside the closet 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.120
 because a Monday at six thirty the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.100

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 important or at least I think so 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.900
