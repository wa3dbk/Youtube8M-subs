has also six axis gyros and
accelerometers<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> exactly<00:01:07.200> does<00:01:07.409> similar

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
accelerometers the exactly does similar

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.950 
accelerometers the exactly does similar
in<00:01:08.549> equality<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.570> devices<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.159> use<00:01:11.189> on
