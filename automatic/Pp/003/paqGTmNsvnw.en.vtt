 alive I always started the day some money and why 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 they took me away 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 and also this report is sponsored by initiating 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.310
 miser pays quickie multiplex be a national pride 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.820
 make sure with yours 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.890
 start with the lowest prices compulsory insurance 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.650
 ariel 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 amid the hullabaloo that caused the training of marita hacked us 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.870
 we found other young professional boxing figures 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.730
 them to this lord spillway of the great Mexican champion 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.450
 telesco the salazar has thrown it deny 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.760
 a boy who has to stay in 12 step despite receiving many criticisms 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.559
 despite having top the name of the Pope 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.490
 one of the best fighters in the history of rented pugilism 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.610
 he is here 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.050
 and he was also 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.689
 I will take the previous training 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.909
 to this fight was the Filipino like this was 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.630
 part of the important group of sparring that the pacman had for this lawsuit 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.040
 Against Antonio Margarito, he took advantage of the closing of Julio César Chávez Junior 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.049
 to let go a little to be in the pear to give the jump to jump a 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.499
 little and there you were able to go warming up facing a good possible in combat 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.750
 future in dates but here is what Julio Cesar Chavez Junior said 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.180
 flavors the fight this Saturday this is an authoritative opinion because it was in 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.830
 the pacquiao camp 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.530
 july césar chávez junior 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.420
 talking about mega combat 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 on Saturday 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.990
 it's not a difficult hard fight because because I repeat myself it's a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.740
 will eat of 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.280
 but the difference but that can be 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.060
 physical condition and the speed of manecal pacquiao I think that that can be 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 the difference the fight 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.570
 and then it's a couple fight 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.129
 this marrero has an advantage because of his height his weight 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.400
 and pacquiao because it's much faster and I think it's a much better use because 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.489
 there is too much favoritism for pacquiao or is it real 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.619
 it has to be like that 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.189
 yes it's a little weird because merit comes from 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.549
 of one year and a half of inactivity 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.989
 Esteve the estate we got from 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.429
 his team fight could not knock him out so 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.579
 came a bit of from a difficult moment of his career but 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.949
 at the same time 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.099
 has is 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.389
 everything to gain and nothing to lose 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.779
 that's 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 that's very very very good for the block 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.439
 because he does not have as much pressure as Pacquiao took note of the press that they are going to 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.099
 support 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.620
 - in practice I was already locked up they shared training I know what 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.680
 it feels to be there 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.559
 how it feels to be with pacquiao 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.699
 not because today he is a great fighter 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.729
 we train hard 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.729
 I think that has been the key for what he has done 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.039
 and he has achieved everything he has done from within boxing for his training 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.789
 your dedication and 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.459
 and because I admire him, I do not admire him because he is a great fighter but he is at the same time 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.569
 also with mexican I would like him to do well with the monolith and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.569
 sold he will carry his native of 154 pounds 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.800
 and to be sure to be a 160 pounds here is what Chávez said 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.640
 fuck on purpose ricardo mayorga is scheduled for the month of 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.530
 December in Miami 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.080
 this was what the Mexican answered about the rumors that were heard 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.080
 only a lawsuit against the Nicaraguan ricardo mayorga 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.419
 - Well, I got that month 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.489
 as an option a dance with which technically boxing is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.329
 business too 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.589
 and since he gets older 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.299
 rosemary superior strong enough 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.339
 I think he did not devote 100% to boxing 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.429
 but that he failed a bit in his preparation sometimes 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:00.539
 but it is a prior fight boom 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.149
 very very strong 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.329
 for cala parma a final point to this report 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.119
 from breath in texas with the coverage of peanut pacquiao and antonio margarito 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.740
 the fight 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.750
 of this Saturday 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.290
