00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hey, guys, beauty here is the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.370
 west bringing another video game play 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.389
 in today's video I'll be talking about 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.880
 best class to play hardy point 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 At least here I found until now I 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.069
 I think you are going to do very well with 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.489
 her because I actually found a class 

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:25.439
 very good very easy to be used then 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.539
 I hope you like this class. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.919
 When you're playing you can 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.859
 test it and a good luck with it because 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.609
 She really is very good but I 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:42.149
 I liked it a lot and I got her fame. 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:45.719
 Good yesterday, but before I talk, I almost 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 I'll tell you a bit about this game play and it was 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.909
 on the map plaza was a location by 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:58.469
 connect play is bridge ray in series 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:01.019
 champions then it was basically this 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.789
 location on map plaza location 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.519
 game mode that I like very much 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.520
 you know the three modes 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:15.060
 competitive I really like the three 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 what is the hard point troy 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 are three really great game modes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 very nice competitive then play 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:30.840
 I really like it because it's a game mode. 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.420
 very easy to get the kits because 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.219
 who does not know when you capture ht 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.659
 That's where I'm now that I 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.420
 this location I have to 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.640
 defend the goal 200 points and was the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 first to capture or if I steal 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 location of the enemy is then 200 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.469
 points to enter the player's hp there 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.259
 that you kill every enemy is every 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.979
 you pick up there inside the hp and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.799
 gift 125 points then it's as if you 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.799
 had an online radio a hard line 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.170
 already in game mode then 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.630
 very easy to get even sad escort 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.490
 It is a way of giving much point and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.630
 I advise you to play in if you are 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.110
 catch high sport links or want to 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.990
 even get nuclear 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.870
 You know that nuclear I got db 23 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.390
 and it was on this map too hi 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.880
 only location was the team was not 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.190
 free litigation but I advise a lot 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.720
 so you play with a sport 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.030
 high chic 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.800
 I've never seen an escort who are tall 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.020
 Why do I call play? 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.220
 as soon escort to pick up their game even 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.040
 for the win 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.860
 but if you go and play the open lobby is 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.130
 A great idea to play with high slicks 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.170
 I advise you to play in conversation, dog. 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:53.860
 own more advanced 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.280
 bit more in the beginner 's bishop the old 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 responsive and versatile 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.820
 so let's go here I wanted to move to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.770
 you also strategies for the map 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.620
 plaza and I find a very good map to play 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.160
 but it's a map that requires a lot of strategy 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.480
 also the strategy is very similar 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.739
 similar to that of emem if it is going to be 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.910
 basically so you should play 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.519
 you play with 13 machines on how m 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.910
 and software was the difference here 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.830
 is that the images can be the same as the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.350
 same map and a half you can play 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.810
 when of mg mg for the class I 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.010
 I'll show you what's good for me now. 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.380
 class 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.410
 only to ray software was the advice 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.910
 you play one day and 94 because how is one 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.250
 smaller map will adapt very well because 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.980
 She is forrÃ³ where bush she only gives four 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.340
 shots then burst an automatic weapon 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.519
 an automatic software is would be very 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.130
 or on this map and the guy who will be 10 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.799
 out will talk to you stay out of hp and 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:11.440
 defending those who are very legal 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.260
 that I forgot to spend was that for 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.150
 you go to the next round point 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.940
 that for those who know do not see each 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.090
 minute green bridge county you come 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.979
 every 10 seconds on the other west side 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.479
 missing ten seconds support for another 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.970
 bridge place for you to get the 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.370
 200 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.020
 where capture is because you go 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.270
 capture 1st that your team is still going 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.630
 earn 200 points there will earn 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.610
 200 Easy Dots Just Taking Goal 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.320
 that location is quite easy to 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.610
 defend if you have a team 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.860
 who knows how to play and now I 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.990
 I'm going to present a classic for me. 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.290
 best thing so far that I found the 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:55.400
 compete in that mode there and it is 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.160
 location and despite the 57 as you 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.610
 already could see the sights and to size 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.780
 laser with stock go beyond stock 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.780
 two of me 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.450
 in the first pique ballistic vest in the 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.700
 second obstinacy and in the third you 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.130
 will use the cd advantage will put 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.620
 Tuba Silence and Tactical Mask 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.850
 If you do not want to, you can take the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.540
 tuba links or wear a mask 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.000
 tactic even uses a lethal grenade and a 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:28.720
 light grenade or a smoke grenade 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.460
 it also helps a lot and I was using 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.130
 I really advise you to use 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.220
 only league play in the open lobby 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.840
 I do not think they are very efficient but 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.590
 There, do not call play. 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.760
 I advise you to play with Michel. 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.050
 storm electric discharge and sentinel that 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.419
 this intriguing 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.550
 however I think you can change or 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.190
 light minister that the missile defendant stone 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.260
 Please, let it be with you, summer. 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.110
 just saw what happened in front 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.419
 captured the location so I guess a lot 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.900
 efficient and let be in the location 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.630
 even if you follow, you can make a 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.050
 score very good outside the competitive I am 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.419
 playing against a part of my team 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.120
 I was random, I was not in port. 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.710
 11 get a good gameplay there like me 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.740
 said this class is very good and 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.440
 I advise you to use them I can here 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.270
 a last tactic that a good tactic 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.570
 basic there for when you are 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.300
 there in the ballad that does not know the 1st raid 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.610
 bridge is one of the most complicated of you 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.200
 When you enter it is very 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.389
 difficult for the enemy to take 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:43.039
 basically so you go in there 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.780
 you stay in the banks 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.759
 there you are getting the enemy banks 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.350
 will not be able to take away 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.880
 so this is what folks were you 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.590
 have enjoyed your home that 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.169
 possible your favorite 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.169
 Thank you so much and see you next time.
