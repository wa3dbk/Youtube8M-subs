00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
i have found so i figured out my own way

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
i have found so i figured out my own way
each<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> mark<00:00:57.180> into<00:00:57.660> four

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
each one you're going to mark into four

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
each one you're going to mark into four
equal<00:00:58.020> sections<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
equal sections and I do this by just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.929 
equal sections and I do this by just
finding<00:01:03.719> our<00:01:04.110> fight<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.559> folding<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
finding our fight just folding them in a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.399 
finding our fight just folding them in a
move<00:01:08.150> by<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.390> finding<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> center<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> then

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
move by just finding the center and then

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.760 
move by just finding the center and then
I<00:01:13.409> mark<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.160 

and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.310> from<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.579> center<00:01:20.030> point<00:01:20.299> I<00:01:20.689> use

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
and then from that center point I use

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.929 
and then from that center point I use
that<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.649> find<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:22.250> other<00:01:22.399> two<00:01:22.490> center

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
that and find the other two center

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:30.190 
that and find the other two center

why a speed mark now let's do this one

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.180 
why a speed mark now let's do this one
and<00:02:09.079> also<00:02:09.709> an<00:02:09.950> easier<00:02:10.280> way<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:11.110> if<00:02:12.110> you're<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.160> a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and also an easier way is if you're on a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:22.970 
and also an easier way is if you're on a
mat<00:02:13.459> where<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.000> count<00:02:14.900> even

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.640 

we'll<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.909> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we'll just do this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:03:02.280 
we'll just do this
I<00:02:26.599> have<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.989> that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.260 

okay<00:03:03.129> now<00:03:03.430> they're<00:03:03.640> all<00:03:03.670> marked

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.800 

ok

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.670 

now<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:15.010> spots<00:03:15.340> where<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.510> marked<00:03:16.780> that's

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
now the spots where you marked that's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.760 
now the spots where you marked that's
where<00:03:17.920> you're<00:03:18.069> going<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> glue<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.620> want

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
where you're going to glue and you want

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.059 
where you're going to glue and you want
to<00:03:20.830> keep<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.130> print<00:03:21.849> side<00:03:22.180> down<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:23.590> glue<00:03:23.860> and

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
to keep it print side down to glue and

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:33.830 
to keep it print side down to glue and
work<00:03:24.220> with<00:03:27.780> okay<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.140> we<00:03:29.230> make<00:03:29.410> our<00:03:29.590> first<00:03:29.830> glue

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.059 

and<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.930> want<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.140> bring<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.440> around<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:38.069> it's

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
and you want to bring it around so it's

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.320 
and you want to bring it around so it's
still<00:03:39.610> print<00:03:40.120> side<00:03:40.390> up<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:42.640> way<00:03:42.880> when<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.180> do

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
still print side up that way when you do

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:51.509 
still print side up that way when you do
the<00:03:43.450> loop<00:03:43.660> it's<00:03:44.099> print<00:03:45.099> side<00:03:45.370> up<00:03:45.610> see<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.769> then

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
the loop it's print side up see and then

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.920 
the loop it's print side up see and then
make<00:03:51.790> another<00:03:52.120> glue<00:03:52.450> right<00:03:52.720> next<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
make another glue right next to it and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.090 
make another glue right next to it and
you<00:03:55.930> aren't<00:03:56.200> going<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.380> bring<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.650> big<00:03:56.860> piece

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
you aren't going to bring the big piece

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.820 
you aren't going to bring the big piece
around<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.580> time<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.180> your<00:03:59.019> second<00:03:59.470> mark<00:03:59.680> is

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
around this time and your second mark is

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.820 
around this time and your second mark is
where<00:04:00.430> you're<00:04:00.580> going<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:01.060> put<00:04:01.269> on<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.810> glue

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:14.510 

now<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:05.950> looks<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.160> Mickey<00:04:06.730> Mouse<00:04:06.819> ears

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.479 

now<00:04:15.150> glue<00:04:15.480> again<00:04:18.560> bring<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.650> around<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
now glue again bring it around to the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.630 
now glue again bring it around to the
third<00:04:20.850> mark<00:04:21.860> and<00:04:22.860> third<00:04:23.040> mark<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.460> where

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
third mark and third mark is where

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:32.180 
third mark and third mark is where
you're<00:04:23.790> going<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.000> glue<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.210> down<00:04:24.300> it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.750 

then<00:04:32.900> one<00:04:33.900> lakh<00:04:34.140> glue<00:04:34.560> em<00:04:35.430> back<00:04:36.420> up<00:04:37.550> one<00:04:38.550> last

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
then one lakh glue em back up one last

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.080 
then one lakh glue em back up one last
glue<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.210> bring<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.510> last<00:04:39.690> loop<00:04:39.990> around<00:04:42.110> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
glue to bring the last loop around and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.390 
glue to bring the last loop around and
there<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.210> have<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:47.370> have<00:04:47.550> your<00:04:47.730> loop<00:04:51.110> ok

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
there you have it you have your loop ok

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.500 
there you have it you have your loop ok
we'll<00:04:53.400> do<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.640> other<00:04:53.670> one<00:04:53.850> really<00:04:54.180> fast<00:04:54.420> so

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
we'll do the other one really fast so

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:06.090 
we'll do the other one really fast so
you<00:04:54.600> can<00:04:54.720> see<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.990> put<00:04:55.110> together

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.840 

are<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.850> making<00:05:07.000> now<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.540> small<00:05:08.700> just<00:05:09.700> like

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
are you making now in small just like

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:18.300 
are you making now in small just like
the<00:05:10.000> other<00:05:10.150> one

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:27.000 

just<00:05:19.060> like<00:05:19.480> a<00:05:19.510> bunny<00:05:19.840> hear<00:05:25.230> me<00:05:26.230> out<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.620> little

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
just like a bunny hear me out the little

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:56.390 
just like a bunny hear me out the little
boy<00:05:28.620> mommy<00:05:29.620> is<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:29.980> like<00:05:30.280> somebody<00:05:30.640> sneaking

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.010 

so<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:58.090> last<00:05:58.330> one<00:05:58.600> is<00:05:58.720> done<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.790> then<00:06:01.020> you

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
so the last one is done and then you

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.890 
so the last one is done and then you
just<00:06:02.260> take<00:06:02.530> them<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.330> stack<00:06:04.330> them<00:06:04.510> on<00:06:04.630> top<00:06:04.690> of

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
just take them and stack them on top of

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.660 
just take them and stack them on top of
each<00:06:05.170> other<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:07.920> it's<00:06:08.920> okay<00:06:09.220> if<00:06:09.250> they<00:06:09.490> don't

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
each other and it's okay if they don't

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.570 
each other and it's okay if they don't
lay<00:06:09.820> perfect<00:06:10.300> because<00:06:10.630> that's<00:06:10.960> how<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:12.430> bow

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
lay perfect because that's how the bow

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.660 
lay perfect because that's how the bow
gets<00:06:12.880> his<00:06:13.030> character<00:06:13.570> and<00:06:14.100> if<00:06:15.100> you<00:06:15.250> like<00:06:15.460> how

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
gets his character and if you like how

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:29.239 
gets his character and if you like how
it<00:06:15.700> is<00:06:18.390> just<00:06:19.390> glue<00:06:21.450> and<00:06:22.590> stick<00:06:23.590> it<00:06:23.740> in<00:06:23.950> there

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:29.249 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:34.819 

and<00:06:29.479> then<00:06:32.629> figure<00:06:33.629> out<00:06:33.899> which<00:06:34.229> positioning

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:34.829 
and then figure out which positioning

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:50.589 
and then figure out which positioning
you<00:06:34.919> want<00:06:35.069> the<00:06:35.159> bow<00:06:35.309> and<00:06:36.259> then<00:06:37.259> glue<00:06:37.439> the<00:06:37.589> bone

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.529 

then<00:06:51.599> you<00:06:51.750> can<00:06:51.900> just<00:06:52.080> fix<00:06:52.439> the<00:06:52.680> loop<00:06:52.860> and<00:06:53.539> shut

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
then you can just fix the loop and shut

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:59.270 
then you can just fix the loop and shut
up<00:06:54.659> you<00:06:55.169> have<00:06:55.379> a<00:06:55.409> bow<00:06:56.270> 350
