beta<00:03:15.850> version<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.920> its<00:03:18.190> own<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:20.380> know<00:03:20.590> when

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
beta version so its own you know when

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.530 
beta version so its own you know when
it's<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.640> beta<00:03:22.120> version<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:24.790> doesn't<00:03:25.360> offer

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
it's a beta version it it doesn't offer

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.100 
it's a beta version it it doesn't offer
really<00:03:27.239> good<00:03:28.239> stuff<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.970> beta<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.870> just

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
really good stuff because beta it just

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.370 
really good stuff because beta it just
basically<00:03:32.410> means<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.250> still<00:03:33.610> not<00:03:33.820> fully

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
basically means is still not fully

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.430 
basically means is still not fully
complete<00:03:35.380> yet<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.700> there<00:03:37.239> are<00:03:37.269> some<00:03:37.930> things

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
complete yet so there are some things

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.319 
complete yet so there are some things
that<00:03:38.650> might<00:03:39.579> make<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:41.280> bad<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:44.079> if<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.489> would
