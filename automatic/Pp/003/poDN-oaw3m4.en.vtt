00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.930
 for this purpose 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.430
 the ri acrylic plastic plate 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:22.400
 flask and spilled paint brushes 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.619
 acrylic colors in a plastic plate 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.760
 help yourself with a brush to remove the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.760
 colors from jars 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.370
 after mixing the colors on the plate 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.120
 with a brush start painting 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 the flask 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.930
 let it dry 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 choose the colors you like best 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.339
 pour them into a dish and mix them 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.659
 spread the color on the 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.570
 flask and if this should not 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.290
 be sufficient to add more 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 on the plate 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:31.909
 repeat the same procedure for the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:34.909
 upper part of the object you can 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.720
 give a brighter touch by applying 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.720
 two different colors 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.270
 let it dry 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:28.200
 pour the color into the dish e 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:30.150
 mix it now draw two branches of a 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.190
 tree on the sides of the upper part of the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.750
 flask bearing in mind that if the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.000
 color is not enough 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.000
 you will have to resume it and another 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.790
 now draw two branches of a sui tree 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.709
 sides of the top of the flask 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.670
 bearing in mind that if the color does not 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.439
 should suffice 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.659
 you'll have to take it a little more 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.200
 dipping the brush into the plate of 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.900
 plastic 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.590
 in this way the colors will be more 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.590
 lit 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.860
 once the branches have been created the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.370
 owl's belly by dipping the brush 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.939
 directly into the abyss of color 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.939
 let it dry 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.710
 add the missing parts of the owl 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.710
 beak legs and eyes
