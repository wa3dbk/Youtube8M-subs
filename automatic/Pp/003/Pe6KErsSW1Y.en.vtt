00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
literally the hardest thing to film like

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.590 
literally the hardest thing to film like
i<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.550> ninja<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.330> start

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
i just get all ninja like and start

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.210 
i just get all ninja like and start
moving<00:02:12.750> everywhere<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.800> gets<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.130> of

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
moving everywhere and I gets out of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.670 
moving everywhere and I gets out of
