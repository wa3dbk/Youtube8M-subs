00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740 
so what we're going to do is um probably
notice<00:01:55.950> folder<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> inside<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.240> file<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
notice folder and inside that file that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410 
notice folder and inside that file that
you<00:01:57.930> will<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.860> couple<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.939> files

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you will actually get a couple of files

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.050 
you will actually get a couple of files
these<00:02:01.049> basically<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.710> these<00:02:01.860> stuff<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.909> here

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
these basically all these stuff in here

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
these basically all these stuff in here
it's<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.689> any<00:02:03.990> useful<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> me<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it's not really any useful to me the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
it's not really any useful to me the
only<00:02:05.219> thing<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.390> folder<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
only thing I want out of this folder is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.639 
only thing I want out of this folder is
this<00:02:07.729> demo<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.420> point<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.349> two

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
this demo just to point out with the two

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.520 
this demo just to point out with the two
files<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.459> drawer<00:02:11.819> under<00:02:12.060> Jason<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.260> I'm

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
files in the drawer under Jason so I'm

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 
files in the drawer under Jason so I'm
if<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.160> spiky<00:02:14.670> keep<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.630> for<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
if you spiky keep that in there for a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.260 
if you spiky keep that in there for a
second<00:02:16.410> minimize<00:02:16.920> e<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.280> basically<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.240> down

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
second minimize e and basically go down

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.460 
second minimize e and basically go down
to<00:02:18.600> your<00:02:18.720> start<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.810> press<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.200> %<00:02:22.860> app<00:02:24.470> data

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
to your start and press in % app data

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.640 
to your start and press in % app data
and<00:02:26.360> center<00:02:27.360> again<00:02:27.600> then<00:02:28.080> you'll<00:02:28.260> come<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and center again then you'll come to a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.699 
and center again then you'll come to a
folder<00:02:28.980> called<00:02:29.130> roaming<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:31.260> show<00:02:31.500> on

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
folder called roaming and we show on

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.449 
folder called roaming and we show on
your<00:02:31.920> ami<00:02:32.220> folder<00:02:32.550> go<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:33.090> minecraft<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
your ami folder go to your minecraft and

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.690 
your ami folder go to your minecraft and
then<00:02:35.459> look<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.300> folder<00:02:36.630> called<00:02:36.959> versions

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
then look for a folder called versions

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.400 
then look for a folder called versions
then<00:02:38.700> once<00:02:38.970> you're<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.180> there<00:02:39.600> are<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.170> going

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
then once you're on there are we going

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.130 
then once you're on there are we going
to<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:41.160> up<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:42.300> window<00:02:42.900> what<00:02:43.050> you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
to do is get up the the window what you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.860 
to do is get up the the window what you
had<00:02:43.230> before<00:02:43.410> with<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.800> notice<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.870> just

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
had before with the notice and just

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.430

basically<00:02:46.230> drag<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.860> notice<00:02:47.459> folder<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.870> here

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
basically drag the notice folder in here

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.120 
basically drag the notice folder in here
and<00:02:50.750> make<00:02:51.750> sure<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.080> trip<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.470> our<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.950> and

there's mine cause notice so I'm just
going<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.720> let<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.930> if<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.709> can't<00:03:52.950> actually

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
going to let that if you can't actually

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.130 
going to let that if you can't actually
find<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.880> least<00:03:54.060> do<00:03:54.480> remember<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.959> click

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
find in the least do remember to click

find in the least do remember to click
these<00:03:55.440> options<00:03:55.920> because<00:03:56.220> basically<00:03:56.430> these

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
these options because basically these

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.420

will actually add a more list becomes
some<00:03:59.970> other<00:04:00.090> hacks<00:04:00.299> might<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.690> an<00:04:00.780> alpha

dot 2.0 in the background I'm just going

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.010 
dot 2.0 in the background I'm just going
to<00:04:35.510> open<00:04:36.020> up<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.260> single-player<00:04:36.949> map<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.780> let's

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
to open up a single-player map so let's

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.530 
to open up a single-player map so let's
go<00:04:39.590> six<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.040> see<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.550> world<00:04:40.760> has<00:04:40.970> loaded<00:04:41.360> and

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
go six and see the world has loaded and

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.689 
go six and see the world has loaded and
I<00:04:41.810> believe<00:04:42.199> it<00:04:42.590> because<00:04:43.040> I<00:04:43.250> already<00:04:43.430> installed

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
I believe it because I already installed

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.850 
I believe it because I already installed
the<00:04:44.120> anode<00:04:44.750> atom<00:04:44.960> mod<00:04:45.229> working<00:04:45.440> on<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.770> I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the anode atom mod working on it I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.939 
the anode atom mod working on it I
believe<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.430> had<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.669> new<00:04:47.210> car<00:04:47.479> so<00:04:48.350> that's<00:04:48.710> why

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
believe I had the new car so that's why

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.700 
believe I had the new car so that's why
I<00:04:48.979> say<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.490> believe<00:04:49.790> still<00:04:50.690> on<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.260> last<00:04:51.530> time

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
I say I believe still on the last time

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.500 
I say I believe still on the last time
so<00:04:51.979> just<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.310> prove<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:52.850> actually

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510
