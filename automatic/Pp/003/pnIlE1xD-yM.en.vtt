00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.430 

so<00:00:11.940> if<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.150> take<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.570> box<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.049> just

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so if I take this box and just

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140 
so if I take this box and just
obliterate<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> corner<00:00:14.639> ready<00:00:14.790> and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
obliterate it in the corner ready and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.450 
obliterate it in the corner ready and
then<00:00:15.660> put<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> water<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.100> weight<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
then put it in the water the weight of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.010 
then put it in the water the weight of
the<00:00:17.520> water<00:00:17.730> rushing<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.300> will<00:00:18.449> cause<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> box

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the water rushing in will cause the box

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.519 
the water rushing in will cause the box
to<00:00:19.199> sink<00:00:20.270> if<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.359> take<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.779> box<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to sink if I take this box and do the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.410 
to sink if I take this box and do the
same<00:00:22.740> thing<00:00:28.429> it<00:00:29.429> tips<00:00:29.730> over<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.210> bit<00:00:30.359> but

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
same thing it tips over a little bit but

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.470 
same thing it tips over a little bit but
it<00:00:30.660> still<00:00:30.900> floats<00:00:31.189> this<00:00:32.189> box<00:00:32.520> uses<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> same

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
it still floats this box uses the same

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.750 
it still floats this box uses the same
kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> design<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.530> naval<00:00:35.040> architects<00:00:35.520> use

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
kind of design that naval architects use

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
kind of design that naval architects use
to<00:00:36.270> prevent<00:00:36.510> ships<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> thousand<00:00:37.559> times<00:00:37.739> bigger

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
to prevent ships a thousand times bigger

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
to prevent ships a thousand times bigger
from<00:00:38.370> sinking<00:00:39.079> what's<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.170> special<00:00:40.410> about

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
from sinking what's so special about

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
from sinking what's so special about
this<00:00:40.920> box<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.520> prevents<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> from<00:00:42.149> sinking

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this box that prevents it from sinking

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.670 
this box that prevents it from sinking
even<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.320> hole<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.620> its<00:00:43.739> side<00:00:48.680> let's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
even with the big hole in its side let's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
even with the big hole in its side let's
talk<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.010> why<00:00:50.250> ships<00:00:50.550> sink<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> first

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
talk about why ships sink in the first

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
talk about why ships sink in the first
place<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.170> probably<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> things<00:00:53.070> will

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
place you probably know that things will

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
place you probably know that things will
float<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.550> water<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.030> less<00:00:54.210> dense<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
float in water if they're less dense in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
float in water if they're less dense in
water<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.050> sink<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.530> they're<00:00:55.680> more<00:00:55.829> dense<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
water and sink if they're more dense the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.459 
water and sink if they're more dense the
metal<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.480> ship<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> made<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
metal that this ship is made out of is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
metal that this ship is made out of is
way<00:00:58.649> more<00:00:58.829> dense<00:00:59.100> than<00:00:59.219> water<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> might

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
way more dense than water so you might

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
way more dense than water so you might
think<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.570> would<00:01:00.629> sink<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.949> metal<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
think it would sink but that metal of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.799 
think it would sink but that metal of
shapes<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.879> traps<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> air

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
shapes with that traps a lot of air

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
shapes with that traps a lot of air
which<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> less<00:01:04.470> dense<00:01:04.710> than<00:01:04.890> water<00:01:05.010> inside<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
which is less dense than water inside it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
which is less dense than water inside it
so<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> average<00:01:07.140> density<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> hull<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so the average density of the hull of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
so the average density of the hull of
the<00:01:08.130> ship<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.760> much<00:01:09.150> lower<00:01:09.450> than

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the ship is actually much lower than

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.980 
the ship is actually much lower than
that<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> water<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> ship<00:01:11.159> floats<00:01:11.869> but<00:01:12.869> if

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that of water so the ship floats but if

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
that of water so the ship floats but if
the<00:01:13.110> hull<00:01:13.260> springs<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.619> leak<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.920> fills<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.280> with

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the hull springs a leak it fills up with

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
the hull springs a leak it fills up with
water<00:01:14.460> there's<00:01:15.240> no<00:01:15.330> more<00:01:15.600> air<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> lower<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
water there's no more air to lower the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
water there's no more air to lower the
average<00:01:16.439> density<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> hull<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> ship

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
average density of the hull so the ship

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.010 
average density of the hull so the ship
sinks<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.670> design<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.270> box<00:01:21.509> basically

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
sinks the design of this box basically

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.480 
sinks the design of this box basically
prevents<00:01:22.380> too<00:01:22.560> much<00:01:22.770> water<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.159> getting

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
prevents too much water from getting

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.929 
prevents too much water from getting
into<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:25.590> box's<00:01:26.070> whole<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> divided<00:01:26.759> up

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
into it this box's whole is divided up

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.730 
into it this box's whole is divided up
into<00:01:27.090> watertight<00:01:27.720> compartments<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.530> these

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
into watertight compartments with these

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
into watertight compartments with these
walls<00:01:29.040> called<00:01:29.340> bulkheads<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> made<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
walls called bulkheads so when I made a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
walls called bulkheads so when I made a
hole<00:01:31.259> right<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.470> only<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.490> compartment

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
hole right here only this compartment

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.270 
hole right here only this compartment
filled<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.450> water<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.560> rest<00:01:34.799> stayed<00:01:35.009> dry

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
filled up with water the rest stayed dry

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.480 
filled up with water the rest stayed dry
and<00:01:35.520> were<00:01:35.670> able<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> keep<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> Box<00:01:36.570> afloat

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
and were able to keep the Box afloat

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.990 
and were able to keep the Box afloat
this<00:01:38.490> box<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.000> subdivided<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.350> ization<00:01:41.000> say

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this box is subdivided in so ization say

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
this box is subdivided in so ization say
the<00:01:42.119> ship<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.479> divided<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:42.990> 10<00:01:43.200> watertight

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the ship is divided into 10 watertight

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.010 
the ship is divided into 10 watertight
compartments<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.180> area<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> ship<00:01:45.689> got

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
compartments if one area of the ship got

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
compartments if one area of the ship got
damaged<00:01:46.470> only<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.220> compartment<00:01:47.759> would

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
damaged only that compartment would

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.480 
damaged only that compartment would
flood<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.840> any<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> others<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
flood but not any of the others the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.889 
flood but not any of the others the
added<00:01:50.790> weight<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> water<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.689> would

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
added weight of the water here would

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
added weight of the water here would
cause<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> ship<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> tip<00:01:52.890> over<00:01:53.040> little

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
cause the ship to tip over little

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
cause the ship to tip over little
to<00:01:53.999> be<00:01:54.090> angled<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.719> trimmed<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> water<00:01:55.469> but

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
to be angled or trimmed in the water but

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
to be angled or trimmed in the water but
it<00:01:56.280> wouldn't<00:01:56.549> completely<00:01:56.850> sink<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.600> could

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it wouldn't completely sink and could
