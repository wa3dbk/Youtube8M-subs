00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I think that's definitely I over here

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.150 
I think that's definitely I over here
isn't<00:03:06.060> aful<00:03:06.560> well<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.650> definitely<00:03:07.739> took<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
isn't aful well it definitely took the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.520 
isn't aful well it definitely took the
corners<00:03:08.489> really<00:03:08.640> well<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.570> think<00:03:10.080> we<00:03:10.320> needs

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
corners really well but I think we needs

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.170 
corners really well but I think we needs
to<00:03:10.739> coming<00:03:11.160> out<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.370> second<00:03:11.700> gear<00:03:11.730> was<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
to coming out of second gear was a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.910 
to coming out of second gear was a
little<00:03:12.600> bit<00:03:12.810> doggish<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.470> think<00:03:13.739> that's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
little bit doggish but I think that's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.130 
little bit doggish but I think that's
you<00:03:14.070> know<00:03:14.100> nothing<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.459> tune<00:03:14.670> can't<00:03:14.910> fix<00:03:15.140> so

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
you know nothing to tune can't fix so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.559
