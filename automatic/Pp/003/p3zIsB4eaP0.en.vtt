00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
it's it's tough when you're forced to do

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's it's tough when you're forced to do

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
it started it's been long awaited and I

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.420 
it started it's been long awaited and I
think<00:01:22.780> they're<00:01:22.899> all<00:01:22.990> excited<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.649> have<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.190> real

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
think they're all excited to have a real

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.249 
think they're all excited to have a real
meaningful<00:01:24.670> game<00:01:25.060> offensively<00:01:25.840> they're

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
meaningful game offensively they're

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.130 
meaningful game offensively they're
their<00:01:26.649> threat<00:01:27.040> obviously<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:28.750> just<00:01:28.930> need<00:01:29.050> to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
their threat obviously we just need to

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.810 
their threat obviously we just need to
keep<00:01:29.259> our<00:01:29.440> shape<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:29.950> don't<00:01:30.280> need<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.640> attack

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
keep our shape we don't need to attack

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.570 
keep our shape we don't need to attack
with<00:01:31.240> them<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:31.929> know<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.289> good<00:01:33.250> amount<00:01:33.369> of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
with them you know a good amount of

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.520 
with them you know a good amount of
number<00:01:33.910> but<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.750> know<00:01:34.840> keep<00:01:35.050> our<00:01:35.200> shape<00:01:35.380> in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
number but you know keep our shape in

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.719 
number but you know keep our shape in
the<00:01:35.590> back<00:01:35.770> make<00:01:36.039> sure<00:01:36.069> if<00:01:36.280> we<00:01:36.369> don't<00:01:36.550> get<00:01:36.640> to

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
the back make sure if we don't get to

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.400 
the back make sure if we don't get to
spread<00:01:36.940> out<00:01:37.060> too<00:01:37.240> much<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.660> Blanco<00:01:38.080> can<00:01:38.289> have

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
spread out too much so Blanco can have

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.550 
spread out too much so Blanco can have
time<00:01:38.679> to<00:01:39.640> run<00:01:39.789> at<00:01:39.970> us<00:01:40.090> with<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.360> ball<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:40.990> you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
time to run at us with the ball so you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
time to run at us with the ball so you
know<00:01:41.649> I<00:01:41.679> think<00:01:41.890> if<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.039> do<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.459> we're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
know I think if we do that and we're

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.490 
know I think if we do that and we're
going<00:01:42.789> alright<00:01:43.000> for<00:01:43.810> me<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.050> not<00:01:44.110> about<00:01:44.289> who

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
going alright for me it's not about who

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.669 
going alright for me it's not about who
we're<00:01:44.649> playing<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:46.509> more<00:01:46.720> about<00:01:46.840> how<00:01:47.140> how<00:01:47.619> we

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
we're playing it's more about how how we

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.559 
we're playing it's more about how how we
prepare<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.340> how<00:01:48.429> we<00:01:48.490> get<00:01:48.789> we<00:01:49.060> go<00:01:49.209> out<00:01:49.360> there

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
prepare and how we get we go out there

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.210 
prepare and how we get we go out there
and<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.840> really<00:01:50.289> believe<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.560> i<00:01:50.770> don't<00:01:51.009> i

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
and I really believe that i don't i

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.499 
and I really believe that i don't i
don't<00:01:51.550> think<00:01:51.880> there's<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.060> team<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.479> beat

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
don't think there's a team that can beat

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.960 
don't think there's a team that can beat
us<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.899> work<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.560> our<00:01:53.770> game<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.550> if<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:54.759> can

us and work on our game so if we can

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.820 
us and work on our game so if we can
just<00:01:55.179> take<00:01:55.509> care<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.780> ourselves<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.380> work
