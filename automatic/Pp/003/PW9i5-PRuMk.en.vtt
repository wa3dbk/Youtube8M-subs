and in another fruit bar and a pair of

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.039 
and in another fruit bar and a pair of
dry<00:04:15.560> socks<00:04:15.590> again<00:04:16.239> if<00:04:17.239> your<00:04:17.389> feet<00:04:17.570> start<00:04:17.780> like

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
dry socks again if your feet start like

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.080 
dry socks again if your feet start like
blistering<00:04:18.560> getting<00:04:18.769> wet<00:04:18.949> just<00:04:19.280> nasty<00:04:19.970> its

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
blistering getting wet just nasty its

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.200 
blistering getting wet just nasty its
source<00:04:20.329> thing<00:04:20.539> so<00:04:21.070> yeah<00:04:22.070> that's<00:04:22.550> pretty<00:04:22.789> much

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
source thing so yeah that's pretty much

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.910 
source thing so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:04:23.979> seems<00:04:24.979> like<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.159> ton

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
it seems like a ton

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.070 
it seems like a ton
although<00:04:26.160> I've<00:04:27.150> gone<00:04:27.330> over<00:04:27.390> my<00:04:27.630> list<00:04:27.900> and

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
although I've gone over my list and

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.750 
although I've gone over my list and
there's<00:04:28.200> probably<00:04:28.410> more<00:04:29.040> supplements<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.640> I

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
there's probably more supplements that I

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.060 
there's probably more supplements that I
want<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.970> grab<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.560> definitely<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.650> need<00:04:32.010> to

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
want to grab and definitely I need to

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.650 
want to grab and definitely I need to
get<00:04:32.130> some<00:04:32.310> little<00:04:32.610> snacks<00:04:32.730> with<00:04:33.180> special<00:04:33.510> need

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
get some little snacks with special need

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.390 
get some little snacks with special need
bags<00:04:33.840> they<00:04:34.140> do<00:04:34.200> have<00:04:34.440> lots<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.920> food<00:04:35.130> at<00:04:35.370> all

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
bags they do have lots of food at all

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.670 
bags they do have lots of food at all
these<00:04:35.580> different<00:04:35.760> stations<00:04:36.390> but<00:04:36.680> your

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
these different stations but your

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.160 
these different stations but your
stomach<00:04:38.040> can<00:04:38.190> get<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> little<00:04:38.520> bit<00:04:39.170> sensitive

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
stomach can get a little bit sensitive

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.390 
stomach can get a little bit sensitive
after<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:41.520> long<00:04:41.940> ride<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.080> long<00:04:43.230> run<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.070> it's

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
after a long ride and a long run so it's

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.780 
after a long ride and a long run so it's
good<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.670> have<00:04:44.790> options<00:04:46.400> maybe<00:04:47.400> some<00:04:47.610> things

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
good to have options maybe some things

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.260 
good to have options maybe some things
that<00:04:47.850> are<00:04:47.970> hypoglycemic<00:04:48.870> like<00:04:49.140> beef<00:04:49.350> jerky<00:04:49.410> or

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
that are hypoglycemic like beef jerky or

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.780 
that are hypoglycemic like beef jerky or
salty<00:04:51.380> just<00:04:52.380> anything<00:04:52.740> really<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.550> you

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
salty just anything really that you

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.370 
salty just anything really that you
think<00:04:54.060> you're<00:04:54.210> able<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.570> ingest<00:04:54.900> because<00:04:55.290> I

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
think you're able to ingest because I

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.320 
think you're able to ingest because I
think<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.770> deal<00:04:55.950> is<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.250> burn<00:04:56.610> about<00:04:56.910> 10

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
think the deal is that you burn about 10

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.010 
think the deal is that you burn about 10
to<00:04:57.510> 12,000<00:04:58.320> calories<00:04:58.530> during<00:04:59.010> an<00:04:59.160> ironman<00:04:59.400> day

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
to 12,000 calories during an ironman day

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.890 
to 12,000 calories during an ironman day
which<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.200> four<00:05:01.410> or<00:05:01.590> five<00:05:01.770> times<00:05:01.950> more<00:05:02.340> than

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
which is four or five times more than

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.500 
which is four or five times more than
normal<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.110> your<00:05:04.230> body<00:05:04.380> can't<00:05:04.650> possibly<00:05:05.510> store

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
normal so your body can't possibly store

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.000 
normal so your body can't possibly store
enough<00:05:06.810> energy<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.260> get<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.500> through<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.800> so

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
enough energy to get you through it so

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.280 
enough energy to get you through it so
you<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.340> eat<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:09.360> eat<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.630> eat<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:10.050> think

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
you have to eat and eat and eat I think

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.260 
you have to eat and eat and eat I think
the<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.740> basic<00:05:11.130> rule<00:05:11.340> for<00:05:11.640> how<00:05:11.880> much<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.180> eat

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
the the basic rule for how much to eat

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.300 
the the basic rule for how much to eat
when<00:05:12.420> you're<00:05:12.510> on<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.630> bike<00:05:12.810> leg<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.350> as<00:05:13.680> much

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
when you're on the bike leg is as much

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.460 
when you're on the bike leg is as much
as<00:05:14.490> possible<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:15.150> there<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.300> go<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.960> an

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
as possible so there you go that is an

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.980 
as possible so there you go that is an
Ironman<00:05:17.960> preparation<00:05:18.960> checklist<00:05:20.870> for<00:05:21.870> you

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
Ironman preparation checklist for you

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.230 
Ironman preparation checklist for you
and<00:05:22.200> hopefully<00:05:23.070> we<00:05:23.820> all<00:05:23.850> learned<00:05:24.150> something

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
and hopefully we all learned something

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.600 
and hopefully we all learned something
today
