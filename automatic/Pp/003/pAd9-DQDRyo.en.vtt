the tree to get sunlight you know maybe
around<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.860> bottom<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:17.450> use<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> clear<00:02:18.470> plastic

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
around the bottom I use a clear plastic

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.210 
around the bottom I use a clear plastic
painters<00:02:19.610> plastic<00:02:20.050> six<00:02:21.050> mil<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.650> exact<00:02:22.040> I

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
painters plastic six mil to be exact I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.920 
painters plastic six mil to be exact I
make<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.490> frame<00:02:22.790> around<00:02:23.120> them<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.600> wrap

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
make a frame around them and then I wrap

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.170 
make a frame around them and then I wrap
it<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.709> I'll<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:25.670> keep<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.000> top

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
it in that and I'll just keep the top

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.970 
it in that and I'll just keep the top
block<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.810> it'll<00:02:27.050> allow<00:02:27.260> sunlight<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.709> get<00:02:27.890> in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
