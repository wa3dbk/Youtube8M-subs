00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Speak, everybody, it's okay, we 'll go today. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.400
 show you how to use is the system 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 lighting on your bike in favor 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.500
 your safety when you pedal 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.500
 by the street or on the tracks or unconfirmed 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.050
 The first important tip is for you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.280
 use headlights and lanterns as well 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.379
 daytime 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.340
 Today you have facilities like this one. 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.719
 to use is a headlamp with rechargeable battery 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.440
 needs another stack 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.570
 So do not get friends and lick the battery. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 I'm going to use it only at night because we were going to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.969
 spend per arrives loads and use of the new 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.949
 night then during the day also the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.500
 drivers and pedestrians need to see 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.650
 You arrive with the bike so keep 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 always installed and using that in the parent that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.600
 never patient and backwards all right 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.700
 during the day 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.430
 few people know but there is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.290
 there are options for you to put the headlight 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.320
 also on the helmet and because people 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 indicates you use a bicycle headlight 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 and the handlebars and also the helmet when 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.750
 you will enter a street for example is 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.320
 Can you illuminate where you have to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 log in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 So if you're pedaling, and what? 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.590
 resolve at night mainly to make a 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.689
 conversion or anything like you 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.110
 your way literally you light up 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.689
 your path and keep the focus of light on 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.210
 street and where you want to turn 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.590
 so it is important that also 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 wear a helmet 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.119
 In this case, here we have it for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 example this lighthouse it has all the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.960
 rubberized connectors do not be afraid 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.689
 Go get a rain, no problem. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.370
 from memory that nothing is going to happen is 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.369
 It comes with the battery you put in the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:15.460
 Isa was back here so get out pedaling 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.460
 nableena bothered yesterday 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.140
 Imagine you did not keep your tit 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.870
 lating in seeing anything or track 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.600
 using those headlights with common led 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.760
 they keep getting crap 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.180
 it is there is such here with 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.320
 led clinton technologies was cool and not 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.900
 superstrong light economic and on track is 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.900
 very important you use the headlight as 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.870
 that he is light will not bother 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.940
 Nothing is going to leave, it's just going to be heavy. 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.650
 it's super compact this here by 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.060
 example it has neither the external battery 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.640
 that makes me super strong and is there 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.709
 trail to help you see the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.850
 not all the difficulties you have 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.850
 a tv you know well 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.170
 another important thing is you do not 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.140
 point the lighthouse bike ahead in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.510
 People's eyes do not even come 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.030
 beacon to light your way then 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.530
 fit for the bike that he does 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.160
 I do not know the people when you 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.890
 to use the flashlight or lack the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:51.019
 flashlight is back as far as the headlights 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.410
 small is a great are all they have 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:58.340
 the strobe function is that this function is 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.820
 here the light flashes this here 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.250
 helps save half the battery 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.470
 so it will last twice as long if you use 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.590
 in this way written here 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.709
 understood if it is a very dark place and 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.760
 you pay that same fear you use in the world 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.980
 mode is generally weaker has three 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.110
 weaker modes 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.710
 stronger or weaker battery goes 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.710
 last longer too 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.930
 so you do not have to look like a 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.400
 christmas tree how can it but be 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.890
 well lit 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.350
 both the bike when you are with the 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:53.720
 light up in the helmet behind back on the bike 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.760
 be seen in there stay hidden use 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.640
 light clothes to pedal the single night 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.800
 and with these tips you saw in that 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.140
 video for sure you will pedal more 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.140
 Right there, he spoke
