again<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.120> map<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.440> might<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.829> used

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
again for this map and I might have used

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.000 
again for this map and I might have used
something<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.820> before<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.770> but<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
something like this before so but the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.600 
you can see in the bottom right satcom I
just<00:03:37.560> recommend<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.070> whole<00:03:38.190> point<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.520> this

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
just recommend the whole point of this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.090 
just recommend the whole point of this
is<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.850> get<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.420> radar<00:03:39.780> lit<00:03:40.020> up<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.920> can

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
is to get the radar lit up so you can

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.890 
is to get the radar lit up so you can
use<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.280> or<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.640> believe<00:03:42.150> that's<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.420> first<00:03:42.510> one

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
use it or I believe that's the first one

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.960 
use it or I believe that's the first one
that<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.530> probably<00:03:43.770> swap<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.640> still

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
that you can probably swap out and still

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.699 
that you can probably swap out and still
accomplish<00:03:45.360> what<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.900> need<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.230> get<00:03:46.350> done<00:03:46.530> and

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
accomplish what you need to get done and

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.860 
accomplish what you need to get done and
then<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.520> see<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.880> little<00:03:48.090> glowing<00:03:48.510> ball

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.570 
and I really love this thing not only is
it<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.340> moving<00:03:53.940> trophy<00:03:54.510> system<00:03:55.020> but<00:03:55.860> because<00:03:56.430> it

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
it a moving trophy system but because it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.180 
it a moving trophy system but because it
blocks<00:03:56.850> explosive<00:03:57.780> damage<00:03:58.020> but<00:03:58.709> it's<00:03:58.860> little

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
blocks explosive damage but it's little

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.100 
blocks explosive damage but it's little
radar<00:03:59.370> if<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.730> look<00:03:59.880> up<00:04:00.030> at<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.330> map<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.540> the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
radar if you look up at the map and the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.320 
radar if you look up at the map and the
mini-map<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.770> top<00:04:01.950> left<00:04:02.190> you'll<00:04:02.850> see<00:04:02.910> that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
mini-map on the top left you'll see that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.430 
mini-map on the top left you'll see that
it's<00:04:03.510> got<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> little<00:04:04.170> radar<00:04:05.120> explosions<00:04:06.120> that

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
it's got a little radar explosions that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.260 
it's got a little radar explosions that
spot<00:04:07.440> enemies<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.130> that's<00:04:08.430> pretty<00:04:08.670> awesome<00:04:08.760> it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
spot enemies so that's pretty awesome it

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.260 
spot enemies so that's pretty awesome it
does<00:04:10.020> make<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.650> fan<00:04:11.220> helicopter<00:04:12.090> noise

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
does make a little fan helicopter noise
