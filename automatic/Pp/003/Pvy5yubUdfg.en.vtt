 the projet and so today I also want to 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.050
 channel of theking77nl 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.520
 and of course we have arrow lot 3 again 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.610
 for you because yes that is natural 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.170
 my series that I put on at paul do that 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.580
 do you know now under the hand I think 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.220
 Well I sometimes propose other ones in particular 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.980
 clear the best i like i have the kontest 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.410
 won along with q jay officially and yes 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.390
 that's why this series does i upload 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.670
 twice twice a week at paul 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.280
 for knife that yes who do not know that yet 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.289
 and who think who is that well I have 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.270
 so I won the context and upload it 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.980
 so twice a week with paul 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.170
 call once or duty and call once 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.670
 lot 3 because yes paul didn't have that yet 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.109
 uploaded and then there are quite a few 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.760
 what people who want to see so that 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.859
 I definitely agree with that because yes that good 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.300
 what I receive is for you 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.800
 today I have a gameplay option but 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 our and you already have once or twice 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.820
 in see what our seen before or me not 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.530
 more day in time and I thought yes this is 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.899
 a nice folder for your events 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.850
 quite a lot and yes what you are going for 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.229
 see there are three triple kills 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.319
 So you come later wants 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.360
 namely with the dko 12 and that is the 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:19.030
 shot-gun I play with the narrow and then 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.860
 I switch to the brand kit on which I 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.190
 just before myself for the innocent 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.229
 is 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.030
 yes with the previous explanation I just had the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.789
 engineer and support confused 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.840
 I'm very sorry for that because jacket 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.690
 naturally gives incorrect information 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.099
 then and yes I myself just wear one 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.599
 call or duty player I do call or you 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.550
 in addition, because I sometimes think it's best 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.679
 just like you are not like that 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.000
 not so much at home in how all those 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.530
 classics 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.789
 although that class works so yes I have that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.319
 two were confused 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.729
 information good only yes I have 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.739
 just the name is crystal so that is 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.360
 not very smart so a jacket that one 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.399
 will still look back again 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.229
 just keep that in mind 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.610
 must be swapped because then you are whole 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.700
 good information and here by the way one 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.020
 Stain on the team with popping on 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.989
 and yes this kind of quite a nice one 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.090
 gameplay is quite yes 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.920
 action folder game-play I think I'm going 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.660
 quite a bit dead but eeh yes there 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.039
 is it actually about because yes it is 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.110
 it's just about kills 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.670
 and that made them what you count 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.680
 many 3 can see 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.480
 I play PC so would the graphics 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.579
 might be a little better if 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.930
 as the playstation or xbox 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.519
 you actually 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.959
 yes it is still known that it is much better 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 is on pc 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.709
 Only yes I don't want to show off immediately 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.120
 thea PCs much better 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.170
 this in itself is nice just not for 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.909
 call of duty for battlefield 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.980
 battlefield they also always stay on pc 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.329
 but I or those so I still play too 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.549
 Thinking to appease to a 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.159
 console that it is still a bit more fun 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.099
 is it seems to you did you wake up disco right away 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.349
 especially about talking about is about you 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.239
 patches because yes sometimes you see gadgets or 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.950
 ribbens yes I think they call it a bell 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.439
 much to call them saving 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 that's after or sort of pictures 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.379
 that you see at the top of your screen like 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.359
 be a eztrader for call of duty black 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.200
 people who are vital to see so four and four 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.760
 heads 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.079
 know the story of the wilt or double kill 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.659
 you see all that through those above 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.609
 stand that have 4 3 also that they call 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.079
 then ribbens and you have a lot 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.599
 various chip reasons for example 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.609
 the idea that my two are you have one 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.439
 yes free for all ribbon master in 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.569
 all my stuff and that is 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.060
 pretty good your kick sir I strip 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.349
 part of the match 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.819
 yes so you have a lot of knights you 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.439
 marry shot can have you whole 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.239
 flashes quickly in the picture when they were not 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.030
 Jasper saw it again for espresso 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.979
 pretty fat though you are and you have 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.659
 also as sister higgins and the goes however 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.359
 so very very far so really pretty well 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.579
 nice to collect all that data 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.930
 I myself have the lea reasonably what I 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.849
 I also played quite a lot of that 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.629
 or will I am now less anything 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.359
 less more 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.220
 yes still play but further is his herein 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.220
 is of course super cool to see 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.889
 and yes yes you also look normal 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.930
 for example by what you can achieve 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.269
 besides ribbens you also have yes stars 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.579
 you get stars per weapon if you get 100 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.310
 You have kills with a weapon than you get 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.199
 such a star you get a web and star and 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.000
 yes you can be 100 star in my opinion 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.370
 mauve get the 100 start for a weapon 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.829
 so your 100 stars 100 100 times 100 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.229
 kills and yes you have such a weapon 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.000
 You also have to add actively 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:14.439
 class stars so you brand for example 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.570
 star and we head and sport stars 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.190
 engineer and controller and those are what 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.750
 harder to have languages ​​at least yes i have 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.820
 that can now look over the ricom here 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.860
 star so the sniper star that you get something 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.389
 harder and I find that on my lesson 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.240
 big mistake of calf that or from which 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.210
 coffee tea for pedophile that they 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.940
 have added shopkins to 0 mary 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.800
 could class 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.150
 and is actually just the slide 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.350
 just enter sniper and then you can just 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.630
 be able to set up a shot and then you can 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.370
 just with that i you you sharpen you 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.810
 Sniper class play 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.250
 so that is not really very fat and or 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.950
 I also not very well done 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.810
 yes today is or from which you will find something 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.070
 less and that is in my eyes can 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.020
 you change the way in which I again 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.700
 planted back by his yo that pot and 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.640
 jansen dio those fines and driving 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.560
 cart but you can and shoot 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.300
 so the driver enters the see 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.260
 battlefield much better than on call or 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.730
 duty I think 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.470
 you really see that the knife is full of you 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.030
 goes and then hope edge that chain 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.250
 punishment from that cocktail 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.590
 because thea by text they are actually 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.880
 there is also another story in itself or 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.890
 story apart 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.590
 tags still gives you clear your tower 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.510
 the gold just a pole 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.100
 doc.txt like him by yes yes 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.180
 so other players take it away from you 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.980
 through you see this guest has 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.870
 yes had some weird picture with 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.340
 a bomb and two females free 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.640
 standard because it often passes by 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.250
 get there far you have on premium premium 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.900
 doc.txt and you get it when you 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.920
 premium member 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.410
 and furthermore you can also collect text 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.070
 by playing year round classes and 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.690
 or yes you get deny nurses sewing 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.040
 both are doc.txt 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.480
 and usually the first top tech is not like that 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.770
 very rare and the second would be pretty 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.660
 can be rare so that is in itself 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.370
 super cool of course that you do 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.260
 this also just plain text of yes 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.660
 body off can rip you come as f one 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.160
 nice fidan bath tub tub tub tub tub tub 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.110
 bath 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.700
 Sir Paul Kil and your wife, by the way 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.620
 only with bullets were used up and you got me 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.120
 from bullets in a yes in such a weapon 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.410
 so if not very much 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.669
 it is a shame of course because 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.410
 otherwise you are naturally much more cool 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.820
 estimate that I am certainly a multi 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.190
 feet or higher because such 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.580
 I think 5 or four five men so that it 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.930
 was unwise 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.030
 Excuse me, I am also a little bit myself 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.650
 have a cold now you know who is 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.660
 of course busy and that's so bad 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.030
 fine tapping does not prevent growers everything 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.950
 also known japanese again he halved 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.360
 it could have been a nice shot again 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.010
 I really like so I think every time 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.450
 you get almost 10 kills with it 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.530
 weapon 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.270
 do not know exactly from above but me 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.710
 thought what was something of each jacket 10 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.630
 kills martin in me you get such ribs 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.890
 and I got two because then get 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.510
 you probably have 20 kills with such a thing 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.250
 and you saw the weather as live 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.080
 passing by is really super super fat to 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.430
 see 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.659
 knife I think that is really very cool
