00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.230
 going up on the new aprilia tuono yes 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.300
 immediately perceives the improvements 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.530
 carried out at the level of ergonomics and 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.900
 especially at the level of sel 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.089
 already because while the old woman had one 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.189
 saddle that could almost be compared 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.279
 a plywood was so thin 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.720
 now there is a real saddle that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.999
 especially on road surfaces 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.009
 maybe disconnected helps a lot to 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.649
 absorb the harshness that so much damage 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.260
 also the calibration is particularly annoying 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.510
 of the new fork is something you do 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.210
 in fact, appreciates it immediately while the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.300
 old version tended to dance to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.010
 Also taking this very calmly 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.660
 High speed connection absorbs 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.460
 however very well 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.629
 engine chapter well what to say yes already 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.120
 said a lot about the b4 of a powerful house 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.370
 really exorbitant from the low 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.140
 regimes and offers a wild push 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.839
 this definitely helped by a 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.399
 electronic package without which the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.840
 opened the thunder v4 r 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.330
 probably couldn't either 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.040
 exist because we have the anti wheelie 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.120
 which is true it is a bit rough but a lot 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.680
 effective 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.840
 we have the traction control that 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.740
 also on the track it serves a lot especially 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.660
 with tires 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.790
 maybe not in the mix where the bike 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.350
 would tend to slip a lot 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.390
 on the back 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.400
 traction control intervenes 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.220
 intervenes as in a way that is 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.230
 very intuitive because for the pilot 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.360
 savvy for what he wants to push 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.020
 just set it on the low levels of one 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.850
 on 2 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.090
 because instead maybe he is a beginner 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.040
 everything can be set to 56 giving gas 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.210
 even the center curve and the bike will not do 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.190
 a plissé 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.619
 I'd be lying if I told you I sensed 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.049
 the three extra horses what you hear 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.950
 if anything it is the gear ratio 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.450
 even worse than on her sister 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 rsv4 here in fact in second and third 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.180
 march we really have a lot 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.830
 badness 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 thank goodness there is precisely the traction 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.119
 control that keeps all the beer at bay 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 that the engine and makes available 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.790
 all this is obviously also helped 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.190
 in an environment like the track from the system 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.230
 of quick shift the electronic gearbox does not 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.420
 it is the fastest in circulation but 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.950
 surely it is a help not just 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.690
 continuing to talk about electronics 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.250
 obviously a big news is 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.150
 constituted by the bs 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 coach who say well the operation is 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.850
 optimal it can be regulated on three levels 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.100
 normal which sports for each type of 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.070
 need think that on the track in the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.950
 track mapping even allows for 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.780
 raise the rear wheel 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.599
 thus allowing entry into the drift 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.120
 sliding the back 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.640
 the stuff of real professionals the plant 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.310
 braking well it is absolutely the first 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.890
 of the class itself monobloc brembo not 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.890
 they never lack power but also 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.170
 cycling chapter feeling here too 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 only great confirmations 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.860
 and true the fork offers more comfort 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.590
 as well as the single shock absorber but 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.930
 nothing was lost in the effectiveness in 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.200
 track the bike is really a motorcycle from 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.330
 running is a rsv4 without hull is true e 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.880
 its own is the only naked on the market today 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.670
 to be so sporty to offer 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.230
 similar performance also and above all 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.299
 on the track 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.440
 last but certainly not least 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.849
 chapter price € 16,230 inclusive 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.870
 of the whole electronics package 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.209
 so of a prc and abs certainly not a few of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.829
 these times but certainly in line with
