atmosphere of waking Mars comes from the

atmosphere of waking Mars comes from the
interesting<00:02:55.620> premise<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.160> discovering<00:02:56.760> more

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
and work with yes work with but how you

and work with yes work with but how you
do<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.390> isn't<00:03:04.080> may<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.290> quite<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:04.830> you'd

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
do that isn't may be quite what you'd
