00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.859
 I read it was satanas de mario mendoza this is 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.800
 a book that follows the story of four 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.940
 characters whose stories eventually 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.750
 they go intertwining and good destiny 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.730
 of these stories in the end is a bit 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.589
 well I will not say anything but it is us 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.089
 pretty intense this book I 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.460
 I usually have certain prejudices 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.170
 against Colombian authors - 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.049
 carolina to touch for you carolina your 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.150
 atrophy and good I do not know I have enough 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.040
 prejudices and I always think there I do not 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.780
 they will like it but this book 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.180
 surprised and crossing four 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.439
 stars the next book I read was 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.950
 despues de 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.799
 anatole this book tells the story of 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.270
 a girl who arrives at a university and 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.259
 good meets new colleagues 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.979
 of room and I met people and between that 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.290
 people were a boy a bad boy a 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.220
 British boy 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.170
 Now the case is better than good 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 things happen and if you want to know more about 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.060
 this book I have a review so the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.490
 I'm going to give here 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.820
 to this book I put 4 stars because 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.920
 Spanish is enough and if I'm not for 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 the second book should be coming out in 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 these days I can be wrong but I'm 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.860
 almost sure that saber in this time 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.470
 the next book I read was from 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.299
 martyrdom of Andrew saved this book 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.789
 tells the story of a man who is 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.159
 obsessed with a woman and in the middle of 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.440
 all this creates a band and that band gives 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.600
 as 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.510
 and those things that play at parties 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.580
 rare that water is formed 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.230
 giving and such and a joyful hammer 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 dangerous but if you want to see a 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.780
 objective review of this book can 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.630
 see her here good after hammer I read 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.730
 well the black of capi patrick this book 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.110
 tells the story of two girls who 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.660
 They decide to spend their vacation 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.480
 spring not in hawaii with all its 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.510
 friends but climbing on the mountain like this 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.200
 how good they are going towards the mountain but 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.020
 in the middle of the road they fall a snowfall 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.370
 but a snowfall of epic proportions 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.530
 then they stand in the middle of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.250
 the roads and their options are 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.990
 freeze in the car or look for some 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.630
 cottage that is close in the woods 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.870
 they opt for the seconds but in the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.320
 cottage they find is not very good is 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.440
 say inside the cabin there are two types 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.410
 and well these two guys are already kidnapping 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.050
 if the book develops much more these 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.300
 thematic and has some plot twists 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.310
 pretty good and shortly I'm going to 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.400
 upload a review has is recorded but 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 I have uploaded so many videos that I did not consume 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.170
 so many, I have many waiting but 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.420
 I have to find the time to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.890
 upload them and that they are not all paper more 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.990
 two 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.310
 I really liked this book and it's very 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.050
 different than what written vk 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.590
 fitzpatrick until the moment the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.870
 tetralogy of oxford and that's why 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.880
 I put four stars the next book 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.890
 that I read I do not have it here because I 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.430
 I offer my sister and obviously the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.200
 Cali book and good book if 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.200
 pulled a bone from amy taylor 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.420
 the protagonist of the book is called 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.400
 Caruso and they entered me and he's good 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.590
 some friends that are monsters are 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.659
 chimeras but obviously nobody else knows 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.879
 of them because these monsters are the 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.280
 that have been linked to them but good 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.900
 things happen and they start getting involved in 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.269
 the first ones with the war that have 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.450
 had two million million 40 million days 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.790
 thousands of years with the angels 102 carlos 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.620
 He met an angel and if they want to know more 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.620
 the son of a very good I'll leave 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.440
 my review here in case you want to know 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.209
 he put four stars without tastes the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.790
 next book I read was to enter from 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.739
 christian chaco this book tells the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.660
 story of a boy who is in the high 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.949
 school and what good for some 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.949
 circumstance of life ends 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.660
 working for the narcotics police 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.340
 and good is involved in a lot 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.610
 of things they have to tell these 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.920
 policemen who are propileos alone 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.110
 it is said about the camels 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.420
 well and who distribute the drug in their 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430
 institute but at the same time it's going 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.440
 making friends with these guys and a 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.360
 girl who are pitifully 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.390
 involved in drugs and then it is 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.800
 all this conflict as I say to the 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.050
 police with my friends are 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 involved in this I do not tell you that something 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.720
 good 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.580
 the stopped movement he never saw reads a 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.670
 book like this body theme 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.990
 it was taking him 13 37 the site had 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.180
 joke and law and that is also from me 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.730
 sister that in other notes there was 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.250
 finished how many study of such and the 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.220
 days of blood and the splendor of the itei 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.310
 this is obviously the second part 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.350
 of the trilogy derived a bone and the 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.240
 story continues where what of your last 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.500
 book and then I can not tell you anything 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.990
 because spoilers but I think this book 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.250
 I liked it less than the first 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.950
 because a lot of people say that the first 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.080
 He left romance and I do not think there 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.300
 been like that to me that I am a romantic 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.170
 hard-willed that I can read the books 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:40.580
 roses of life because I lacked romance and 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.460
 this this let's say it's good that I missed 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.410
 much more in the first then that's why 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.720
 I like a little less but you have to 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.230
 say that the limit books and the 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.240
 construction of the world that is wow is 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.100
 such a complex world and all the 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.360
 premises that are handled in r are so 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.360
 similar that 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:05.649
 to have to buy choose for the 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.839
 bronco but that this one I put four 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:12.309
 stars and finally the last book 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.939
 that I read in January was 2002 the mobile 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:16.149
 johnson 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.819
 this book was very entertaining but in 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:21.219
 such beautiful pressure the case tells the 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.239
 story of a girl who is very close 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:27.849
 to his uncle but it turns out in his days he died 

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:29.739
 and his aunt was a local artist who never 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:31.569
 I was home that was always 

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:35.079
 traveling because the artistic need 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.969
 he called her and good crazy things after 

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:41.169
 that the fia was not jean and the 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:45.129
 protagonist receives a box with 13 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:48.189
 blue envelopes and there is a letter congratulates 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.629
 you have to open an envelope each time and 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.549
 the sober degree of going against 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.489
 instructions and tests that should go 

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:56.999
 completing then the first envelopes and 

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:59.729
 he says good here they have money 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.529
 buy yourself a plane ticket to london 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.169
 comes to the house 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:05.869
 So you can open the 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.459
 second envelope and so on 

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:10.739
 then all these clues make them 

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:14.219
 travel throughout europe while when 

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:17.099
 those great people while things are happening 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:20.129
 romantic with a boy who is called 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:23.609
 here and good is free super entertaining 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:24.989
 and I do not know even though I liked it a lot 

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:28.259
 things only three stars 

00:07:24.989 --> 00:07:30.739
 because there I did not miss how to connect 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:33.479
 with the characters how to feel more 

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:36.059
 familiar at the time of reading it but good 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.709
 It was not bad for its three stars and 

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:40.019
 I think if I do not say that this book is from 

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:42.419
 my sister and me kill this book 

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:44.579
 it's on fire and good those towns 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.139
 books that choose January tell me in the 

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:48.119
 comments that books gave him in 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.459
 January of their tour they got some 

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:52.679
 of which I was read and well I do not know 

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:55.039
 I plan to give you video to subscribe to 

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.039
