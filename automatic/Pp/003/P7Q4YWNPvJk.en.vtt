00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi, I'm Mariana and this time 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.360
 I will talk about caster of Anathoth and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 I told booster very strange but it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.469
 well it came out is a book that shows the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 planet I did not know anything about him until 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 I had in my hands I told them in my 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 book or take photos and caused a great 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 controversy the book kidnapped me in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 when I started reading it, let's think 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 who is about to start his first year in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150
 the university gets all excited 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.300
 because because it can be your first day or 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 be to meet new people going to 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.890
 get away from his mother for a while is not not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.020
 true she loves her mom the thing is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 which is how she planned it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.280
 as the roommate totally 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.100
 different from her which has some 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 friends totally different to her is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.860
 he knows harding a guy like bad boy 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 then that 's a contrast because she 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.010
 is all pure all beautiful all organized 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 his life takes a completely turn 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 unexpected that leads to situations 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.940
 too extreme 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.159
 and the truth is that you already start 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.720
 not know a little because he does not understand 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.119
 what is happening in your life 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.509
 she does not know she is in love with harding and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.400
 complain about trafficking superman and I know I 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 I know it's the typical story of the guy 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.350
 bad that treats badly the girl and the girl 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.950
 she falls in love we do not know why she falls in love 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.750
 of abuse and the guy suddenly 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.110
 start to feel something not for her 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.500
 or not the plot is very, very, very 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.800
 interesting I think to make a fan 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 fiction to that they did not know good 6 and 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.560
 knowing all this novel thought doing 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.140
 a fan fiction in harry styles e one 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.830
 Direction rose beautiful caused great impact 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.180
 the publishers is sought 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.950
 what we now have here in 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.140
 our hands something that I have to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.020
 to emphasize is that in no time and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.090
 so he's talking about the group 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.300
 of Harry Okey maybe there are certain 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.399
 similarities with the characters but if 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.310
 you do not like the group if you do not like the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.200
 no problem you can read it is not going to 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.270
 affect anything and on the contrary if you are 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.830
 super fan to like a lot so much 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.950
 with telling them that while I was 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.460
 reading I wanted to listen to music from them 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.980
 Y 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.620
 and this is the first book of the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.770
 it looks like there are going to be four books and they are 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.350
 super chubby and every book that follows 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.200
 It is thicker than the previous garden 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.990
 and tessa have a relationship strip and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.680
 loosen 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.320
 that being sincere I love because I do not 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.880
 you know when they are going to fight and 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.890
 at what point are they going to reconcile 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.960
 Many people find it easy for them 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.640
 It annoys that to me the personal thing 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.150
 He loves it because it's like a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 super intense relationship and and so not the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.910
 book obviously focuses only on 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.490
 garden stiffens and certain little things but 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.350
 a little more secondary just focus 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.510
 in these two characters I think it's a 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.790
 good story I think the way in which 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.480
 the author was structuring it seems to me 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.870
 very very precise ok already already already the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.870
 final 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.470
 to seek the truth while I was 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.140
 reading the book before reaching the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.880
 final I already sensed what was the end 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.280
 I had a feeling it would happen that I 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.020
 I knew it would be that I, I knew that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.300
 that was going to happen but it was still like that 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.880
 too intense and I said ok the way 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.630
 in which they raise it to all I think that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.970
 I liked it, I think I was fascinated by ssa instead 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.050
 to get angry and say to God is in 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.590
 serious was how I love you or is it was not 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.730
 too intense too fascinating 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.930
 why 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.269
 did not leave it was strange book kidnapping me 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:04.150
 as soon as I had it in my hands I did not 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.950
 let him sleep he did not leave me anything or whatever 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.599
 he stopped reading because he explains that he is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.200
 At night I'm supposed to owe myself 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.620
 sleep and was all night dreaming 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.660
 as with what happened next and in the day 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.359
 I was thinking that I want to read it 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.620
 because I want to know what it ends in 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.600
 done right now I'm reading the second 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.520
 book and I'm like I do not want to record 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.160
 video I want to go read the second 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.419
 part this book is not for everyone if you 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.300
 like this kind of relationship books 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.389
 love and hate is a bad thing that ends 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.330
 falling in love this book is for you and the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.250
 truth the truth is that I can not with 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.000
 my life to this book came to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.190
 end with me sincerely and obviously 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.669
 55 star at 10 in Goodreads 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.240
 because I could put more but I did not 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.139
 let 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.180
 yes, when they finish reading it, not because 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.200
 the end but when they finish it 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.150
 read they will feel 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.650
 with a vacuum because one does not happen in 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.650
 real life and 2 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.649
 it does not happen in real life 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.449
 although experience you have passed me 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:18.449
 I would love to know your story because the 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:21.449
 truth is that I sincerely believe that 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:25.050
 this book ends up studying or what 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.449
 you end up loving and I ended up loving you 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.350
 I know that the best for many is the book 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.210
 it's a bit silly 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.729
 I'll be dumb then that's it 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.400
 they do not know how much he has struggled to record 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.069
 I've been postponing this video a lot 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.340
 because it's like I do not know how to express 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.039
 everything that this book caused me this 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.479
 book and well then this would be all for 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.060
 this video I hope you liked it 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.280
 Write me down in the comments if 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.690
 they already read the book that they thought 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.259
 good and I see them later in another video 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.259
 which is pretty
