00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
all right this is a ram rail I guess

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.410 
all right this is a ram rail I guess
probably<00:00:08.360> um<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:10.170> got<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.460> free<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:12.240> review

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
probably um I got it for free to review

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.099 
probably um I got it for free to review
and<00:00:13.250> I'm<00:00:14.250> not<00:00:14.519> sure<00:00:14.820> how<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.389> guys<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.929> get

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
and I'm not sure how you guys can get

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.740 
and I'm not sure how you guys can get
them<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.980> ask<00:00:17.279> around<00:00:17.750> so

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
them but just like ask around so

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.750 
them but just like ask around so
basically<00:00:19.609> it's<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:21.170> rail<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.609> see

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
basically it's a rail as you can see

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810 
basically it's a rail as you can see
it's<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.920> that<00:00:25.920> size<00:00:26.160> compared<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it's about that size compared to a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
it's about that size compared to a
fingerboard<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:29.189> supports<00:00:29.699> are<00:00:29.970> pretty<00:00:30.660> tall

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
fingerboard the supports are pretty tall

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.450 
fingerboard the supports are pretty tall
and<00:00:31.890> bulky<00:00:32.340> they're<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.600> pieces<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.739> square

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and bulky they're just pieces of square

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.459 
and bulky they're just pieces of square
metal<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.300> buy<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.440> hardware

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
metal which you can buy at the hardware

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
metal which you can buy at the hardware
store<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.680> didn't<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.550> like

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
store and then so I didn't really like

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.369 
store and then so I didn't really like
how<00:00:42.030> they're<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.450> tall<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.140> really

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
how they're so tall they don't really

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.810 
how they're so tall they don't really
look<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.590> great<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.010> whatever

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
look that great but whatever

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
look that great but whatever
um<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> rail<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.230> sturdy<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.579> can

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
um the rail is really sturdy as you can

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
um the rail is really sturdy as you can
see<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:49.399> like<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.920> performs

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
see but like I don't know it performs

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.639 
see but like I don't know it performs
good<00:00:55.610> as<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.780> doesn't<00:00:58.320> wobble<00:00:58.469> or

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
good as you can see doesn't wobble or

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
good as you can see doesn't wobble or
anything<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.190> got<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.579> grips<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
anything it's got these grips on the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.060 
anything it's got these grips on the
bottom<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.469> doesn't<00:01:01.739> slide<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:04.070> so

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
bottom too so it doesn't slide and so

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
bottom too so it doesn't slide and so
performance<00:01:05.729> wise<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> pretty<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.510> except

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
performance wise is pretty good except

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.920 
performance wise is pretty good except
the<00:01:07.490> metal<00:01:08.490> piece<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> pretty<00:01:09.659> big

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the metal piece is kind of pretty big

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.640 
the metal piece is kind of pretty big
like<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.040> could<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.610> thinner<00:01:12.650> but

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
like it could be a little thinner but

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.859 
like it could be a little thinner but
it's<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.430> easy<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.150> stuff<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it's really easy to do stuff on so I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
it's really easy to do stuff on so I
guess<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> good<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> only

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
guess that's a good thing I'm the only

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.719 
guess that's a good thing I'm the only
thing<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.270> didn't<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
thing I didn't really like about it is

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
thing I didn't really like about it is
all<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.170> part<00:01:22.470> here<00:01:22.530> those

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
all it is is this part here those

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.710 
all it is is this part here those
supports<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.210> flat<00:01:24.479> part<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
supports and the flat part are just a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.109 
supports and the flat part are just a
like<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> cabinet<00:01:28.560> handle<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> buy

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
like a cabinet handle which you can buy

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.929 
like a cabinet handle which you can buy
at<00:01:30.270> any<00:01:30.450> hardware<00:01:30.780> store<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.579> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
at any hardware store and then as you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
at any hardware store and then as you
can<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> bottom<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.950> screwed

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can see in the bottom it's just screwed

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
can see in the bottom it's just screwed
in<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:37.130> these<00:01:38.210> supports<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.020> could<00:01:40.200> make

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
in to these supports so you could make

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
in to these supports so you could make
it<00:01:40.680> yourself<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.490> five<00:01:41.790> dollars<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> he

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it yourself for like five dollars and he

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.210 
it yourself for like five dollars and he
said<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.970> forget<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.680> 40

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
said I forget I think it was like 40

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.600 
said I forget I think it was like 40
bucks<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.640> something<00:01:48.890> including<00:01:49.890> shipping

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
bucks or something including shipping

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.249 
bucks or something including shipping
which<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.149> 10<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.540> something<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> guess

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
which is like 10 or something so I guess

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.550 
which is like 10 or something so I guess
like<00:01:52.409> 30<00:01:52.740> or<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.759> exactly<00:01:54.000> sure<00:01:54.229> but<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
like 30 or so I'm not exactly sure but I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
like 30 or so I'm not exactly sure but I
think<00:01:56.070> they're<00:01:56.250> about<00:01:56.369> 40<00:01:56.790> bucks<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.390> so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
think they're about 40 bucks or so so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.760 
think they're about 40 bucks or so so
it's<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.340> really<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.640> expensive<00:01:59.880> so

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's kind of really really expensive so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.149 
it's kind of really really expensive so
I'd<00:02:01.770> rather<00:02:02.450> get<00:02:03.450> something<00:02:03.930> else<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.680> primo

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
I'd rather get something else like primo

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.690 
I'd rather get something else like primo
or<00:02:05.280> Black<00:02:05.490> River<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:07.280> don't<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.369> it's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
or Black River but I don't know it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.580 
or Black River but I don't know it's
another<00:02:08.970> option<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.750> want<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.430> yeah

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
another option if you want so yeah

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.949 
another option if you want so yeah
