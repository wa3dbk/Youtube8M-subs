normal until you turn over drive off and
use<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.209> ratchet<00:03:04.420> function<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:07.209> only<00:03:07.450> thing

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
use the ratchet function the only thing

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.670 
use the ratchet function the only thing
it<00:03:07.750> does<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.140> does<00:03:08.320> shift<00:03:08.760> once<00:03:09.760> more<00:03:10.680> forward

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
it does it does shift once more forward

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.790 
it does it does shift once more forward
and<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.190> puts<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.550> in<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.730> neutral<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.620> like

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
and that puts it in a neutral so like

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.520 
and that puts it in a neutral so like
right<00:03:14.980> now<00:03:15.190> it's<00:03:15.370> sitting<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> neutral<00:03:16.209> you

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
right now it's sitting in a neutral you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.770 
right now it's sitting in a neutral you
can<00:03:17.530> know<00:03:17.860> you're<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.160> neutral<00:03:18.370> or<00:03:18.820> second<00:03:19.630> or

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
can know you're in neutral or second or

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.250 
can know you're in neutral or second or
first<00:03:20.049> because<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.769> letter<00:03:20.980> won't<00:03:21.250> lift

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
first because the letter won't lift

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.780 
first because the letter won't lift
probably<00:03:23.260> lift<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.769> go<00:03:23.920> back<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> park<00:03:24.640> of

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
probably lift to go back in the park of

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.050 
probably lift to go back in the park of
it<00:03:24.910> soon<00:03:25.150> they<00:03:25.930> try<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.690> that's<00:03:28.720> drive<00:03:30.060> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
it soon they try so that's drive and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.380 
it soon they try so that's drive and
lift<00:03:31.239> go<00:03:32.230> into<00:03:32.500> neutral<00:03:34.680> lift<00:03:35.680> again<00:03:36.390> into

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
lift go into neutral lift again into

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.680 
lift go into neutral lift again into
reverse<00:03:37.890> reverse<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> highest<00:03:39.940> way<00:03:40.630> to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
reverse reverse is the highest way to

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.160 
reverse reverse is the highest way to
gate<00:03:41.019> system<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.709> works<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.810> order<00:03:43.989> to

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
gate system on it works so in order to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.050 
gate system on it works so in order to
go<00:03:44.350> out<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.560> reverse<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> park<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.700> just

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
go out of reverse to the park you just

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.000 
go out of reverse to the park you just
push<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.269> forward<00:03:47.610> drops<00:03:48.610> down<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.299> park

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
push it forward drops down in the park

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.070 
push it forward drops down in the park
and<00:03:51.010> it's<00:03:51.190> locked<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.700> there<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.600> not<00:03:52.690> going

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
and it's locked in there it's not going

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.140 
and it's locked in there it's not going
anywhere<00:03:54.480> that's<00:03:55.480> pretty<00:03:56.290> much<00:03:56.500> it

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.420 

I<00:03:59.180> guess<00:03:59.810> I<00:04:00.020> might<00:04:00.709> try<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.040> tape<00:04:01.430> my<00:04:02.800> camera<00:04:03.800> to

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
I guess I might try to tape my camera to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.380 
I guess I might try to tape my camera to
the<00:04:04.640> door<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:06.230> see<00:04:06.590> if<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.770> can<00:04:06.890> get<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.090> video<00:04:08.090> of

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
the door and see if I can get a video of

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.440 
the door and see if I can get a video of
it<00:04:08.599> while<00:04:08.900> it's<00:04:09.170> running<00:04:09.349> foot<00:04:10.180> seems<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.360> it

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
it while it's running foot seems like it

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.540 
it while it's running foot seems like it
might<00:04:11.569> be<00:04:11.630> hard<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:11.989> do<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:13.010> probably<00:04:13.280> won't

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
might be hard to do so I probably won't

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.800 
might be hard to do so I probably won't
but<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.480> might<00:04:14.690> we'll<00:04:15.230> see<00:04:15.820> now<00:04:16.820> because<00:04:17.389> what

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
but you might we'll see now because what

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.840 
but you might we'll see now because what
you<00:04:17.930> get

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
you get

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.049 
you get
thank<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.209> hey<00:04:20.989> des
