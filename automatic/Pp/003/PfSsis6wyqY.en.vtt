 Rodriguez assured that this agency as shouted to the air force is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 composed of six military and six civilians 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.280
 we started like this 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.500
 of a new cycle in Ecuador 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 just on April 5, 2005 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 if it is when we start 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 to the meetings of this mixed commission 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 six civilians and six military 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.080
 it was just the beginning of a series of deliberations with the military hierarchy 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.370
 since some refused to provide the records due to 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.929
 who received money from the United States government 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.929
 so they hide information 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.140
 the internal security agent of the presidency of the republic 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.570
 he realizes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.900
 that the American intelligence center was paying the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.020
 Ecuadorian military to hide the information 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.429
 a lot of information 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.869
 the president realizes this issue 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:21.359
 and in an unprecedented case I have the statements and the press 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.069
 unprecedented belt decides expelled all the agents of the company that 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.489
 had already been detected 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.129
 President Rafael Belt meets twice a year with the council of 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.450
 national security at six in the morning 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.330
 In one of those meetings Rodriguez mentioned who was together with a 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.190
 stakeholder group two hours before with banners outside the facility 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.280
 of cosena 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.890
 to press the chief executive and release the records 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.389
 the president in level before tells all the commanders 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.479
 Sirs 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:01.049
 all information about the UFO phenomenon as of today is released 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.059
 we do not want secrets here 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.049
 there was an argument so much that the head of the joint command wielded 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.259
 and it said 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.479
 will remain 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.189
 American machines 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.359
 immediately the president leash raised his voice to order his 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.830
 secretaries who will take out those American ships 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.510
 since they could not violate the Ecuadorian sour space and stressed that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.589
 there would be more bloody in his administration 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.599
 the researcher did not mention that they have also contacted the 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.489
 Minister of Education to make the subject compulsory in schools 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.089
 of basic astronomy 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.690
 we are talking to the education minister 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.730
 so that it is mandatory in all schools 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.389
 the matter of basic astronomy 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.219
 hector lavoe new generations can have access to knowledge 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.009
 of the cosmic environment 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.029
 and so they can understand how the cosmos operates 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.480
 said he received a document signed by the secretary general of the 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.109
 national security council 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.120
 patricio cárdenas proaño 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.709
 to be given all the existing information and that in its 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.949
 archives about UFOs 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.939
 from him he says verbatim that all the information is given to me abi 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:18.859
 and who 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.330
 a document from the air force a document from the army 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.270
 nor a document from him the army the one where it says verbatim 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.860
 that all information must be 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 delivered and declassified without taboos 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.460
 an example that is given after this declassification as sure jaime 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.240
 rodríguez 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.270
 is a photo taken on May 20 of an alleged mobile flying over the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.479
 moroni international airport 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.890
 it's the same people from the air terminal 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.890
 that he has changed his attitude like this to these issues 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.829
 it is important to see the change in the behavior of the people facing the issue 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.180
 before 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.020
 there has always been doubt 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.249
 misappropriation misinterpretation 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.680
 now not the people realized that the UFO phenomenon 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.920
 there are only two alternatives 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.120
 this is a farce in which thousands of people are involved or this is 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.580
 a great reality 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.770
 As of March 13, the first 44 were declassified 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.420
 official testimonies that lie in the power of dry 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.340
 and that the second installment of this work we will present the versions of 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.720
 itp commanders and the two of the ecuador air force 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.810
 colón is to qualify for me hopefully in the coming weeks 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.210
 be more Latin American countries 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.639
 interested in publicizing their files on flying objects 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.110
