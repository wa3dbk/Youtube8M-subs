00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
notice that I didn't think the one was

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.149

the<00:06:40.969> same<00:06:41.180> set<00:06:41.479> but<00:06:41.750> maybe<00:06:42.530> just<00:06:42.710> mixed<00:06:42.979> it<00:06:43.039> up

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
the same set but maybe just mixed it up

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.429 
the same set but maybe just mixed it up
made<00:06:43.460> an<00:06:43.580> alternate<00:06:44.000> design<00:06:44.150> for<00:06:44.599> reach<00:06:45.080> each

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439 
made an alternate design for reach each

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.809 
made an alternate design for reach each
look<00:06:45.740> yeah<00:06:46.159> and<00:06:46.460> had<00:06:48.430> didn't<00:06:49.430> really<00:06:49.639> catch

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
look yeah and had didn't really catch

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.480

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
different than I'm like that max look

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.200 
different than I'm like that max look
very<00:06:54.349> pretty<00:06:54.680> much<00:06:54.860> the<00:06:54.979> same<00:06:55.189> damn<00:06:55.819> Pope<00:06:56.060> a

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
very pretty much the same damn Pope a

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.450 
very pretty much the same damn Pope a
goat<00:06:56.840> that<00:06:56.870> of<00:06:57.050> 199<00:06:57.379> so<00:06:57.800> I'm<00:06:58.099> assuming<00:06:58.189> they

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
goat that of 199 so I'm assuming they

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.180 
goat that of 199 so I'm assuming they
just<00:06:58.639> did<00:06:58.759> a<00:06:58.789> little<00:06:59.270> mixed<00:06:59.539> truth<00:07:00.069> think<00:07:01.069> is

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
just did a little mixed truth think is

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.680 
just did a little mixed truth think is
the<00:07:01.280> homonymous<00:07:01.909> i'm<00:07:02.210> using<00:07:02.449> one<00:07:02.569> of<00:07:02.599> the

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
the homonymous i'm using one of the

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.059 
the homonymous i'm using one of the
reasons<00:07:02.930> i<00:07:03.020> noticed<00:07:03.319> the<00:07:03.379> horizontal<00:07:03.860> design

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069 
reasons i noticed the horizontal design

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.950 
reasons i noticed the horizontal design
just<00:07:04.310> helps<00:07:04.520> the<00:07:04.639> autograph<00:07:05.000> it<00:07:05.509> just<00:07:05.780> looks

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
just helps the autograph it just looks

cooler than me it's more ornately

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.209 
cooler than me it's more ornately
designed<00:07:08.379> but<00:07:09.379> overall<00:07:09.590> I<00:07:09.740> think<00:07:09.919> it's<00:07:10.129> I

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:10.219 
designed but overall I think it's I

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:11.830
