kind of in a problem recently I know
that<00:00:11.040> I've<00:00:11.519> seen<00:00:11.880> many<00:00:12.330> many<00:00:12.570> many

that I've seen many many many

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.589 
that I've seen many many many
dermatologists<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.950> my<00:00:14.070> days<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:15.450> know<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
dermatologists in my days and you know a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.939 
dermatologists in my days and you know a
lot<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> them<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.230> prescribe<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> cream

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
lot of them would just prescribe a cream

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
lot of them would just prescribe a cream
or<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> pill<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:18.180> over<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> long<00:00:18.840> run<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.140> that

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
or a pill but over the long run is that

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
or a pill but over the long run is that
actually<00:00:19.710> making<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.130> skin<00:00:20.400> worse<00:00:20.670> and

actually making your skin worse and
there's<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.300> difference<00:00:21.630> between<00:00:21.859> exfoliating

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
there's a difference between exfoliating

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
there's a difference between exfoliating
which<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.400> healthy<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> skin<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
which is very healthy for the skin and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
which is very healthy for the skin and
natural<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> skin<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.699> then

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
natural for the skin to do and then

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
natural for the skin to do and then
there's<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.660> exfoliating<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.710> cause

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
there's over exfoliating which can cause

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.990 
there's over exfoliating which can cause
pigmentation<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> damage<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.520> scarring<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
pigmentation and damage and scarring and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
pigmentation and damage and scarring and
dark<00:00:33.270> spots<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:34.469> acne<00:00:34.649> worse

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
dark spots and actually make acne worse

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
dark spots and actually make acne worse
so<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.270> exfoliation

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so what is over exfoliation

can happen with something manual like a
clear<00:00:43.530> sonic<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> skin<00:00:44.430> brush<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.239> what

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
some people don't realize is that it can

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
some people don't realize is that it can
also<00:00:47.190> happen<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:47.879> skincare<00:00:48.210> cleanser

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
if it contains ingredients that are

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
if it contains ingredients that are
naturally<00:00:51.120> exfoliated<00:00:51.750> definitely<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> skin

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
naturally exfoliated definitely a skin

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
naturally exfoliated definitely a skin
scrub<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.760> even<00:00:54.059> something<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
scrub but even something like this is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.630

just a foam cleanser it does not have
any<00:00:56.789> scrubbing<00:00:57.300> beads<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.109> also

any scrubbing beads this is also

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.020 
any scrubbing beads this is also
exfoliating<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> does<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
probably will see somewhat of a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390 
probably will see somewhat of a
difference<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.409> only<00:01:28.710> problem<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
difference the only problem is that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
difference the only problem is that
there<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> doctors<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.900> are

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.590 
there are a lot of doctors that are
prescribing<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.070> opinion<00:01:32.579> way<00:01:33.119> too<00:01:33.150> much

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
prescribing in my opinion way too much

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
prescribing in my opinion way too much
and<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:35.159> over<00:01:35.549> exfoliation<00:01:36.060> going

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and there is some over exfoliation going

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.789 
that is definitely something to be
careful<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.200> when<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.440> comes<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
careful of when it comes to

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.949 
careful of when it comes to
overexploiting<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:11.790> what<00:03:12.630> are<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> methods

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
overexploiting so what are the methods

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.559 
overexploiting so what are the methods
like<00:03:13.260> we<00:03:13.440> said<00:03:13.620> manual<00:03:14.010> brushing<00:03:14.569> sometimes

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
like we said manual brushing sometimes

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.610 
like we said manual brushing sometimes
it's<00:03:15.750> too<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.049> if<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.200> take<00:03:16.410> oral

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
it's too much if you take oral

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.410 
it's too much if you take oral
supplements<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.220> do<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.489> how<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.269> know

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
supplements and do this how do you know

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.060 
supplements and do this how do you know
if<00:03:18.540> you're<00:03:18.660> over<00:03:18.900> exfoliating<00:03:19.530> or<00:03:19.650> under

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
if you're over exfoliating or under

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.849 
if you're over exfoliating or under
exfoliating<00:03:20.910> um<00:03:21.660> well<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.320> kind<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.590> hard<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
exfoliating um well it's kind of hard to

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.310 
exfoliating um well it's kind of hard to
know<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.100> you're<00:03:23.220> under<00:03:23.459> exfoliating<00:03:24.060> maybe

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
know if you're under exfoliating maybe

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.620 
know if you're under exfoliating maybe
ask<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.530> doctor<00:03:25.680> or<00:03:26.190> ask<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.940> doctor<00:03:27.090> try<00:03:27.570> to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
ask a doctor or ask a doctor try to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.580 
ask a doctor or ask a doctor try to
figure<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.959> out<00:03:28.079> but<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.320> you're<00:03:28.440> over

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
figure it out but if you're over

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.979 
figure it out but if you're over
exfoliating<00:03:29.340> routinely<00:03:30.209> you'll<00:03:30.480> notice<00:03:30.870> that

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
exfoliating routinely you'll notice that

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.349 
exfoliating routinely you'll notice that
your<00:03:31.140> skin<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.040> glossy<00:03:32.609> do<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.180> ever

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
your skin is kind of glossy do you ever

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.630 
your skin is kind of glossy do you ever
not<00:03:33.660> like<00:03:33.870> oily<00:03:34.320> glossy<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.190> right<00:03:35.459> when

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
not like oily glossy but like right when

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.670 
not like oily glossy but like right when
you<00:03:35.700> get<00:03:35.850> out<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.120> shower<00:03:36.410> or<00:03:37.410> if<00:03:37.500> it's

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
you get out of the shower or if it's

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500 
you get out of the shower or if it's
almost<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:38.100> very<00:03:38.370> very<00:03:38.430> paper-thin<00:03:39.030> but

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
almost like very very paper-thin but

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.140 
almost like very very paper-thin but
like<00:03:39.630> glassy<00:03:40.200> or<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.160> stings<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.970> put

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
like glassy or if it stings to put

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.330 
like glassy or if it stings to put
things<00:03:42.269> on<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:42.660> obviously<00:03:43.500> if<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.799> over<00:03:44.100> like

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
things on now obviously if you over like

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.310 
things on now obviously if you over like
obviously<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.450> exploit<00:03:45.900> your<00:03:45.989> skin<00:03:46.230> with

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
obviously if you exploit your skin with

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.900 
obviously if you exploit your skin with
a<00:03:46.380> Clarisonic<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.160> then<00:03:47.280> go<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.609> put<00:03:47.760> some

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
a Clarisonic and then go on and put some

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.340 
a Clarisonic and then go on and put some
benzoyl<00:03:48.180> peroxide<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.780> might<00:03:48.900> sting<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> little

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
benzoyl peroxide it might sting a little

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.550 
benzoyl peroxide it might sting a little
bit<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:50.040> I'm<00:03:50.160> saying<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.660> if<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.019> exfoliate

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
bit but I'm saying like if you exfoliate

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.199 
bit but I'm saying like if you exfoliate
your<00:03:52.650> skin<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.100> shower<00:03:53.340> or<00:03:53.640> whatever<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
your skin in the shower or whatever and

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.000 
your skin in the shower or whatever and
you<00:03:54.269> come<00:03:54.510> out<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.840> even<00:03:54.989> water<00:03:55.380> burns<00:03:55.530> your

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
you come out and even water burns your

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.530 
you come out and even water burns your
skin<00:03:56.370> which<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.700> has<00:03:56.850> happened<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.359> me<00:03:57.510> before

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
skin which it has happened to me before

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.800 
skin which it has happened to me before
that<00:03:58.049> right<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.859> is<00:03:58.980> over<00:03:59.250> exfoliation<00:04:00.000> so

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
that right there is over exfoliation so

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.449 
that right there is over exfoliation so
if<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.019> are<00:04:01.200> overexploiting<00:04:02.040> how<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.370> you

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
if you are overexploiting how can you

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.970 
if you are overexploiting how can you
stop<00:04:02.730> well<00:04:02.970> first<00:04:03.510> off<00:04:03.720> stop<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.230> burn<00:04:04.410> what<00:04:04.950> I

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
stop well first off stop the burn what I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.740 
stop well first off stop the burn what I
would<00:04:05.160> recommend<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.700> finding<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:06.060> pH<00:04:06.329> similar

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
would recommend is finding a pH similar

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.550 
would recommend is finding a pH similar
to<00:04:06.900> your<00:04:06.989> skin

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
to your skin

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
to your skin
water<00:04:07.769> has<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.010> pH<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.370> about<00:04:08.549> 7<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.870> skin

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
water has a pH of about 7 and the skin

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.050 
water has a pH of about 7 and the skin
is<00:04:10.530> between<00:04:10.950> like<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.160> 4<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> 5<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.880> really

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
is between like a 4 and a 5 it really

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.490 
is between like a 4 and a 5 it really

that's<00:04:15.810> pH<00:04:16.260> balanced<00:04:16.859> if<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.100> know<00:04:17.310> that

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
that's pH balanced if you know that

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.860 
that's pH balanced if you know that
you're<00:04:17.549> over<00:04:17.820> exfoliating<00:04:18.389> or<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.750> your

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
you're over exfoliating or that your

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.420 
you're over exfoliating or that your
skin<00:04:19.289> stings<00:04:19.769> regularly<00:04:20.519> because<00:04:21.090> you

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
skin stings regularly because you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.800 
skin stings regularly because you
could<00:04:21.489> be<00:04:21.609> using<00:04:21.850> something<00:04:22.120> way<00:04:22.300> too<00:04:22.360> acidic

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
could be using something way too acidic

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.480 
could be using something way too acidic
or<00:04:22.960> way<00:04:23.139> too<00:04:23.199> basic<00:04:23.770> that's<00:04:23.979> causing<00:04:24.220> more

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
or way too basic that's causing more

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.659 
or way too basic that's causing more
issues<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:25.389> don't<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.050> could<00:04:26.259> use<00:04:26.410> water

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
issues so don't you could use water

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.770 
issues so don't you could use water
because<00:04:27.669> water<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.240> kind<00:04:28.509> of<00:04:28.570> right<00:04:28.750> in

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
because water is like kind of right in

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.930 
because water is like kind of right in
the<00:04:28.900> middle<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.199> like<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> seven<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.699> would

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the middle of like a seven but I would

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.240 
the middle of like a seven but I would
definitely<00:04:31.360> recommend<00:04:31.530> trying<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.740> find<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:33.009> pH

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
definitely recommend trying to find a pH

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.550 
definitely recommend trying to find a pH

anything like that when you get out of
