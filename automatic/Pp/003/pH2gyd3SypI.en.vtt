00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello is very welcome to Canal + 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.569
 games I'm capable and today we go 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.569
 learn how to make fireworks 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 the basic recipe of fireworks 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.869
 it's very simple just a sheet of paper 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.119
 and a gunpowder item and you're going to make a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.800
 Good rocket and if it's only you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.900
 put as much as you want inside 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.070
 a dispenser and you push a button and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 they launch the most 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.570
 Interesting fireworks 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.890
 load if you add it to the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.300
 rocket stay the same 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 but this time you can see the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 much more local effects to make the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.550
 charge is very simple 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.530
 We're going to need two 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 mandatory ingredients and two 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 optional ingredients the first 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.660
 essential ingredient of the cargo is the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.520
 gunpowder 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.899
 and the second is the color and we have 16 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.059
 colors to choose only one item from the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.949
 proof and color item a nursery in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.609
 soccer, joining the two you have a 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.190
 star 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.370
 You take away the effect that is left here. 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.370
 on here 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.490
 all fireworks or have the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.260
 same format unless you add 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 the ingredient that modifies their form 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.460
 if you add a chardy band 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.070
 you can create a large sphere and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 you add a range of gold you 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 can make a star shape 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.430
 if you add the chardy track and do 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.080
 the large - mouth format and it stays 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.470
 thus comparatively the bope that neither is 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.210
 this one if you add the format 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.240
 star it becomes the format of the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.330
 rocket is unique and can only be or the common 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.680
 or wait great or star 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.960
 however you can add an effect 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.990
 also the effect it can be sparks 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 trail two at the same time 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.660
 this here is the spark effect can 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.030
 see here at the end of the explosion he 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.810
 continues to make small exhibitions in 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 this is the trace effect that is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.440
 very handsome but with a diamond before 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.640
 to show the last step in the making 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.019
 of our cargo I'm going to give some 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.910
 examples for you 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.350
 so if we just pick up an item from 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.450
 gunpowder and something 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.519
 Let's get light blue here in daycare. 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.350
 in time we put the ingredients 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.239
 in any order, I can exchange for 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.459
 example for any lot here folks 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.829
 can take a load and she said ball 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.780
 that the ball and light blue that is blue 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.310
 clear 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.150
 now a little more complicated let's go 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.430
 create one with our ingredients 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 compulsory what is gunpowder a thing 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.769
 Anyways, let's get the green and the people. 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.680
 will choose the star format 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.060
 and we will add an effect of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.890
 sparks at the end of the explosion 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.600
 just let's get these four 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.310
 ingredients of what we want to do and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.900
 put them in a nursery on time in 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.320
 any order that we want to 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.299
 people here take a charge she has star 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.459
 shape that is green star shape that 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.180
 is green and latch which is the effect of 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.160
 favors 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.590
 the last interesting thing that people 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.090
 Can do with our load is to do 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.489
 a transition of curves then its 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.410
 load may explode a color and at the end 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.880
 of the explosion becomes another color 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.530
 so let's take as an example this 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 here is military green 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.400
 so let's make a green transition 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.130
 for white we just need to get the color 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.270
 put the entire kraft together with 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.060
 what we want to make the transition 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.090
 so here she says green but 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.670
 here she says it's green day to night in 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.160
 third line there then it means 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.020
 What is she going to do is a wave of 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.240
 thank you for white we can do 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.190
 The same with other people can make the 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.780
 the color gradation but all this is 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.610
 optional are only ingredients 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.500
 mandatory are those two above and 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.290
 everything else is optional 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.750
 Let's do ours here, if our 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.670
 second rocket switch from blue to 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.460
 red then here again 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.720
 I'll put it here it's light blue, come on. 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.230
 condition a red here in any 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.420
 place 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.740
 She is going to cross Jesus clear to 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.210
 red and is ready to be 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.130
 added on the rocket do the last 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.870
 process step 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.160
 the last stage of our 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.480
 creation of a rocket 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.550
 just put a craft 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.340
 integrated the load that you just 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.150
 make a paper item and an item 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.130
 gunpowder 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.660
 one's there coolest thing that has us 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.790
 fireworks here they behave 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.100
 up to three different charges then you 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.750
 can create a lot of effects and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.610
 put up to three made within the same 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.920
 rocket that is represented by this 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.930
 paper and the amount of gunpowder that 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.880
 goes at the end controls rocket height 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.680
 so if you need to put a 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.870
 gunpowder that the minimum height of the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.120
 if you put two separate tests in 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.160
 two lots of pf integrated we will go 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.320
 send a high rocket if you put 3 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.640
 goes very high 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.180
 this is an example of a rocket with 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.180
 three loads 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.120
 this is an example of a rocket that 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.120
 goes very high 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.850
 comparatively this here is height 1 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.850
 This is the height 3 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.360
 now you already know how to make fireworks 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.040
 artifice in case you do not understand 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.140
 something leaves a question in the 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.030
 comment and if you liked it 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.530
 video to join the channel because 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.300
 Every week, there's again. 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.300
 big hug for you and even more 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.550
 I'll show you how to create a 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.670
 empty map 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.290
 it is very useful for you to do tests 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.500
 So if you want to build a 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.500
 mansion
