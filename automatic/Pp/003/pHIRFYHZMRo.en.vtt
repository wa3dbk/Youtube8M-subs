love or a best friend the key is that

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.810 
love or a best friend the key is that
the<00:00:12.509> lines<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.410> top<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.309> lovers<00:00:14.610> knot

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the lines on the top of the lovers knot

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.480 
the lines on the top of the lovers knot
could<00:00:15.690> never<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.139> refolded<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.920> exactly<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
could never be refolded in exactly the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.400 
could never be refolded in exactly the
same<00:00:17.520> way<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> wrote<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.140> note<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
same way so if you wrote this note to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990 
same way so if you wrote this note to
someone<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.070> some<00:00:20.609> other<00:00:20.760> person

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
someone and some other person

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300 
someone and some other person
intercepted<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.050> tried<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> read<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.710> they

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
intercepted it and tried to read it they

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.920 
intercepted it and tried to read it they
could<00:00:23.490> never<00:00:23.609> get<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> folded<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.480> again<00:00:24.779> in

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
could never get it folded up again in

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.420 
could never get it folded up again in
the<00:00:25.019> exact<00:00:25.320> same<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.160> would<00:00:26.279> know

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the exact same way and you would know

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.939 
the exact same way and you would know
that<00:00:26.460> someone<00:00:26.970> else<00:00:27.029> had<00:00:27.240> read<00:00:27.390> your<00:00:27.510> message

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
that someone else had read your message

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.290 
that someone else had read your message
so<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.010> start<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> piece<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> origami

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so you start with a piece of origami

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.870 
so you start with a piece of origami
paper<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.500> write<00:00:31.679> your<00:00:31.859> secret<00:00:32.579> message

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
paper and you write your secret message

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
paper and you write your secret message
on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> inside<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:35.360> once<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:36.630> set<00:00:36.870> we

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
on the inside of it once you are set we

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
on the inside of it once you are set we
are<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> start<00:00:38.070> folding<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.610> number<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
are going to start folding a number of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650 
are going to start folding a number of
guidelines<00:00:39.829> going<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> fold<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.460> half<00:00:41.660> left

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
guidelines going to fold it in half left

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.170 
guidelines going to fold it in half left
to<00:00:42.899> right<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> crease<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.700> down<00:00:45.590> open<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> up

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
to right and crease that down open it up

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.890 
to right and crease that down open it up
fold<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.480> half<00:00:48.510> top<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.500> bottom

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.270 

the<00:00:52.900> key<00:00:53.080> here<00:00:53.110> is<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.440> make<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.770> number<00:00:54.130> of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
the key here is to make a number of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.520 
the key here is to make a number of
lines<00:00:54.490> so<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.630> rest<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:56.080> the<00:00:56.170> folding

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
lines so that the rest of the folding

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.980 
lines so that the rest of the folding
goes<00:00:56.770> more<00:00:57.040> easily<00:00:57.370> later<00:00:57.940> on<00:00:58.740> open<00:00:59.740> it<00:00:59.830> up

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
goes more easily later on open it up

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.590 
goes more easily later on open it up
fold<00:01:01.990> it<00:01:02.170> diagonally<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:03.190> one<00:01:03.370> direction<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
fold it diagonally in one direction so

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.310 
fold it diagonally in one direction so
that<00:01:04.630> the<00:01:04.840> two<00:01:05.020> corners<00:01:05.380> me<00:01:06.510> dividends

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 

and<00:01:10.440> open<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> you've<00:01:11.940> guessed<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.360> we

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and open it up and you've guessed it we

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.540 
and open it up and you've guessed it we
fold<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:13.020> diagonally<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> opposite

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
fold it diagonally in the opposite

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.450 
fold it diagonally in the opposite
direction<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.650> two<00:01:16.830> corners<00:01:17.220> meet<00:01:19.460> so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
direction so the two corners meet so

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.860 
direction so the two corners meet so
there<00:01:20.640> you've<00:01:20.760> got<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.510> different

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
there you've got it with the different

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.399 
there you've got it with the different
folds<00:01:22.200> already<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> next<00:01:24.810> part<00:01:25.140> might

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
folds already now this next part might

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.260 
folds already now this next part might
seem<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.010> confused<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.820> watch<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
seem a little confused but watch it a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
seem a little confused but watch it a
couple<00:01:27.300> times<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> hang<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.500> what

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
couple times to get the hang of it what

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
couple times to get the hang of it what
you're<00:01:29.460> doing<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.970> squashing<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.750> bottom

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you're doing is squashing the bottom

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.070 
you're doing is squashing the bottom
down<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.430> forms<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.880> triangle<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
down so that it forms a triangle and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.280 
down so that it forms a triangle and
when<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.220> happens<00:01:35.840> they<00:01:36.840> tighten<00:01:37.200> up

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
when that happens they tighten up

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.770 
when that happens they tighten up
forming<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.860> triangle<00:01:38.190> too<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.630> all

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
forming a triangle too because of all

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.510 
forming a triangle too because of all
those<00:01:39.900> guidelines<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.500> made<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.190> look<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
those guidelines we made so look at this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.400 
those guidelines we made so look at this
from<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.910> side<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.380> how

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
from the side and you can see how

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.560 
from the side and you can see how
there's<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> bottom<00:01:44.070> triangle<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
there's a bottom triangle and then the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
there's a bottom triangle and then the
pieces<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.080> paper<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
pieces of paper go in and out in the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.020 
pieces of paper go in and out in the
middle<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> trap<00:01:48.899> triangle<00:01:49.940> once<00:01:50.940> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
middle and then a trap triangle once you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
middle and then a trap triangle once you
get<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.420> set<00:01:51.690> then<00:01:52.470> give<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.830> nice

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
get it all set then give it a nice

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.290 
get it all set then give it a nice
crises<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.119> flatten<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:55.080> inside<00:01:55.440> parts

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
crises to flatten down the inside parts

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.639 
crises to flatten down the inside parts
and<00:01:57.300> again<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.869> something<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.440> might

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and again this is something that might

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.190 
and again this is something that might
look<00:01:58.770> confusing<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.520> first<00:01:59.550> but<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.840> get

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
look confusing at first but if you get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.160 
look confusing at first but if you get
that<00:02:01.380> piece<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> paper<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.160> folded<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.640> nicely

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
that piece of paper all folded up nicely

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
that piece of paper all folded up nicely
take<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> look<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> couple<00:02:04.890> times<00:02:05.039> then

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
take a look at this a couple times then

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.940 
take a look at this a couple times then
it<00:02:05.940> will<00:02:06.060> really<00:02:06.240> make<00:02:06.479> sense<00:02:06.720> how<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.560> bottom

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it will really make sense how the bottom

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.249 
it will really make sense how the bottom
triangle<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.820> top<00:02:09.030> triangle<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.690> then

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
triangle and the top triangle and then

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
triangle and the top triangle and then
the<00:02:10.410> two<00:02:10.590> sides<00:02:10.890> fold<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the two sides fold in to make that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.340 
the two sides fold in to make that
squish<00:02:12.360> down

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
squish down

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.930 
squish down
so<00:02:14.950> once<00:02:15.160> you've<00:02:15.280> caught<00:02:15.460> up<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.730> me<00:02:15.820> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so once you've caught up to me and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.240 
so once you've caught up to me and
you've<00:02:16.060> got<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.390> part<00:02:16.630> set<00:02:16.870> take<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> top

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
you've got that part set take the top

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.590 
you've got that part set take the top
point<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.910> your<00:02:19.030> triangle<00:02:19.480> fold<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.650> down

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.150 

now<00:02:23.690> you're<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.110> fold<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.620> left<00:02:24.860> point

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
now you're going to fold the left point

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.390 
now you're going to fold the left point
in<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> center<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.740> then<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.160> right

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
in to the center and then the right

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.290 
in to the center and then the right
point<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> center<00:02:31.030> these<00:02:32.030> are<00:02:32.150> all

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
point in to the center these are all

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.930 
point in to the center these are all
just<00:02:32.330> again<00:02:33.020> preliminary<00:02:33.680> folds<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.790> can

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
just again preliminary folds so we can

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.440 
just again preliminary folds so we can
do<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.150> next<00:02:35.210> part<00:02:36.190> put<00:02:37.190> your<00:02:37.400> thumbs<00:02:37.880> under

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
do this next part put your thumbs under

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.160 
do this next part put your thumbs under
that<00:02:38.600> top<00:02:39.020> layer<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.620> lift<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.790> up<00:02:40.930> see<00:02:41.930> how<00:02:42.050> it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
that top layer and lift it up see how it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.280 
that top layer and lift it up see how it
goes<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.500> makes<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.860> little<00:02:43.810> straight<00:02:44.810> line<00:02:45.050> up

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
goes and makes a little straight line up

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.620 
goes and makes a little straight line up
there<00:02:45.530> by<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.860> point<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.060> now<00:02:47.180> fold<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
there by the point and now fold in the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.510 
there by the point and now fold in the
two<00:02:47.930> sides<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.530> they<00:02:48.740> will<00:02:48.860> fold<00:02:49.100> down<00:02:49.220> nicely

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
two sides and they will fold down nicely

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.910 
two sides and they will fold down nicely
to<00:02:50.330> meet<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.780> top<00:02:50.990> line<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.440> just<00:02:51.650> fold

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
to meet that top line that you just fold

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to meet that top line that you just fold
it<00:02:52.040> up<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.610> means<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.090> point<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.670> again

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
it up that means the point so again

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.220 
it up that means the point so again
those<00:02:56.090> guidelines<00:02:56.390> make<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.020> happen

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
those guidelines make this happen

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.420 
those guidelines make this happen
relatively<00:02:58.130> easily<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> show<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.080> again

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
relatively easily so to show you again

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.670 
relatively easily so to show you again
we've<00:03:01.430> got<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:02.450> top<00:03:02.690> point<00:03:03.050> which<00:03:03.290> we<00:03:03.320> fold

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
we've got the top point which we fold

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.280 
we've got the top point which we fold
down<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:06.410> pulled<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.520> side<00:03:08.180> triangle<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:08.990> to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
down and pulled the side triangle in to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.140 
down and pulled the side triangle in to
give<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> guideline<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.760> other<00:03:10.850> side

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
give a guideline and the other side

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.090 
give a guideline and the other side
triangle<00:03:11.600> into<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.990> center<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.920> give<00:03:13.070> a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
triangle into the center to give a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.390 
triangle into the center to give a
guideline<00:03:14.050> now<00:03:15.050> if<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.320> put<00:03:15.560> your<00:03:15.740> fingers<00:03:16.250> or

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
guideline now if you put your fingers or

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.270 
guideline now if you put your fingers or
thumbs<00:03:16.640> into<00:03:17.060> just<00:03:17.270> that<00:03:17.420> top<00:03:17.630> layer<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.980> lift

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
thumbs into just that top layer and lift

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.630 
thumbs into just that top layer and lift
that<00:03:19.490> top<00:03:19.790> layer<00:03:20.030> up<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.560> goes<00:03:21.770> up<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.430> meet

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
that top layer up so it goes up to meet

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.680 
that top layer up so it goes up to meet
three<00:03:23.060> top<00:03:23.360> point

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
three top point

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.860 
three top point
this<00:03:25.230> means<00:03:25.470> backed<00:03:25.710> up<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> right<00:03:26.400> side

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
this means backed up on the right side

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.960 
this means backed up on the right side
follow<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.950> they<00:03:29.880> will<00:03:30.030> fold<00:03:30.300> flat<00:03:31.970> to

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
follow in and they will fold flat to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.810 
follow in and they will fold flat to
meet<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.930> top<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.250> extreme<00:03:35.670> line

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
meet the top so you have extreme line

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.570 
meet the top so you have extreme line
across<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> top<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.770> point<00:03:38.160> down

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
across the top and you have a point down

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.660 
across the top and you have a point down
at<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.820> bottom<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:40.040> hope<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> helped<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.370> show

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
at the bottom I hope it helped to show

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.280 
at the bottom I hope it helped to show
that<00:03:41.820> from<00:03:42.180> both<00:03:42.300> sides<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:42.960> can<00:03:43.170> see

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
that from both sides that you can see

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.150 
that from both sides that you can see
what<00:03:43.440> was<00:03:43.560> happening<00:03:45.500> alright<00:03:46.500> we're<00:03:47.070> going

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
what was happening alright we're going

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.520 
what was happening alright we're going
to<00:03:47.310> fold<00:03:47.550> over<00:03:47.820> just<00:03:48.210> one<00:03:48.300> layer<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.410> we

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
to fold over just one layer so that we

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.830 
to fold over just one layer so that we
now<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.860> pointy<00:03:50.490> triangle<00:03:50.760> instead<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.690> it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
now have a pointy triangle instead of it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.870 
now have a pointy triangle instead of it
poop<00:03:52.050> in<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.650> center<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.130> again<00:03:53.400> fold<00:03:53.760> in

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
poop in the center and again fold in

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.450 
poop in the center and again fold in
just<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.330> layer<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:55.410> if<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.620> point<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.950> triangle

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
just one layer so if I point a triangle

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.890 
just one layer so if I point a triangle
that's<00:03:57.030> how<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.210> know<00:03:57.360> you've<00:03:57.480> got<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.720> fold

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
that's how you know you've got the fold

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.340 
that's how you know you've got the fold
right<00:03:58.100> fold<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.250> bottom<00:03:59.880> point<00:04:00.630> triangle<00:04:01.200> up

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
right fold the bottom point triangle up

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.620 
right fold the bottom point triangle up
to<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> top<00:04:01.770> flip<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.700> over<00:04:02.820> fold<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.510> bottom

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:17.559 
each of the four folds and that way if

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.259 
each of the four folds and that way if
anyone<00:05:17.949> else<00:05:18.069> tries<00:05:18.399> to<00:05:18.549> open<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.939> and<00:05:19.029> close

anyone else tries to open it and close
it<00:05:19.329> there's<00:05:19.989> no<00:05:20.199> way<00:05:20.319> that<00:05:20.469> they'll<00:05:20.649> ever<00:05:20.769> get

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
it there's no way that they'll ever get

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.859 
it there's no way that they'll ever get
this<00:05:21.249> all<00:05:21.369> folded<00:05:21.759> up<00:05:21.909> again<00:05:22.209> and<00:05:22.389> have<00:05:22.719> all

this all folded up again and have all
those<00:05:22.989> squiggly<00:05:23.289> lines<00:05:23.619> meet<00:05:23.889> so<00:05:24.729> it'll<00:05:24.939> be

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
those squiggly lines meet so it'll be

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.139 
those squiggly lines meet so it'll be
clear<00:05:25.299> that<00:05:25.449> someone<00:05:25.629> else<00:05:25.779> has<00:05:26.019> intercepted
