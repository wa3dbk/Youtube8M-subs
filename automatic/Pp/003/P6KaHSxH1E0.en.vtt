 for everyone how this day is part of a series of editorials that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.349
 bad do not throw it away 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.199
 that will enter on products that we do not like as it acts when we like the 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.699
 colorado indiana works badly or that is how we can take advantage of them 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 in particular it's about the farc is that we do not like 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.910
 to me this is to keep these taxable camera vats from the stores of the 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909
 Chinese specifically this center is supposed to be the only one I do not like 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.069
 because it covers a little look at me making that signature 

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:37.069
 acquire from there is 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.520
 it covers a little 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.060
 then I liked it for nothing has 101 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.910
 ue uu days as color as the lines of the mannequins that is so 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.800
 Fashion 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.749
 creator 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.689
 it does not cover a bit and then it is as semi-transparent that it can be 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:59.649
 appreciate who helps faithful appointment to the rag or wood chips better 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.290
 Well the fact is that I do not like it well, because we can do with them several 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.850
 things we can do things directly in the enamel so that the changes will 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.130
 do the Valdez channels and we have just gone to the ibook store 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.240
 A car 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.619
 to get capitation say if it's a little bit of enamel it mixed what it 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 longing applied and I keep retaining this endorse me to be able to make different 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.320
 social change as we want if we like a lot changes we will make known 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.760
 directly pijijiapan we close that uncheck in that way 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.090
 As we aspire to several houses of adobe do in terrible ones 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 I go to that little rite recipe of the week 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.210
 i the perimeter that intervenes we also had to do that is clear with a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.410
 little shadow 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.720
 whether it's a shade in dust like that type say tobacco could be a shadow that 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.369
 we have broken that we can take advantage 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.920
 and we're going to mix it with the enamel 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.990
 Well, I'm going to use for example 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.680
 being in the shadow of here is a title in everything 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.269
 let it be in a tone 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.939
 very dark kings 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.519
 it's like a grayish green 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.849
 Well, I'm just going to mentally pick up where the enamel comes from and I can blame a 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.859
 bit 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:19.960
 delphi 30 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.960
 we mix well 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:28.509
 and it is that in the area they remain united from another side that has nothing to do with 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.869
 the values ​​that we had 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.869
 vélez 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.959
 I'm going to apply a little about the notebook for what 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.419
 eta has known 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.529
 green magazine time super nice day more people comment heap 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.529
 because he reads a foot he said pilates 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.809
 specifically in this change we like a lot then what would I do 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.419
 I would harvest some sterile mentasti directly on the battery in 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.159
 villa alternating channels like it would be something else we can do certain 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.360
 words make a mix uncheck 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.459
 I'm going to catch 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.239
 the strategist is that I do not like it I'm going to take away some of this dark brown 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.959
 you and I like it but when I'm going to forget a little and a little 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:15.630
 January 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.059
 and so while the father palmar 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.299
 let's catch 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.169
 the enamel you will see 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
 I'll be in a cart 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.409
 I tell you the same thing if we like it or we can not do it directly on the edge 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.409
 of the enamel said 'we have a glaze that we like 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.139
 we are also going to do the tests 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.429
 in the cart and then if we like it can be perfectly in the scheme 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.389
 I'm going to be 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.389
 one boot only from brown 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.919
 and for now only also black 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.119
 the time of color we get 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.179
 and now key issues 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.199
 nail polishes have also been shown 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.870
 in 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.579
 montse doing as omar scorer is a technique the truth that had 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.440
 disturbed blurry that keeps casting Baltics in water and then tuck the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
 nails and it gets bigger statewide libya is not a bit cumbersome 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.910
 that they leave pretty well then doing is a mix enamels can also be 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.240
 get if we do not mix well a bit spectra a little bit way 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.120
 rad 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.600
 Well, it's already 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.150
 we have managed to strain totally different what we like more or 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.719
 less 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:48.319
 to me specifically I like more than the color that I have had most beautiful 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.810
 and also how he claims them with a sensual mint like this much more 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.449
 with consolidated with color that covers much more there you have it 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.110
 I tell you the same thing if we like it we do it directly in the enamel what we are going 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.430
 well and we already have the enamel that we like fernandez has been the own 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.909
 Estevez has resurrected destined to 100 of them will
