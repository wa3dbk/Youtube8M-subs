00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.180
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.779
 let's make some strawberry cupcakes 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.060
 for the cake we're going to need 60 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.210
 grams of softened butter 100 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.210
 grams of sugar an egg 100 grams of 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.840
 flour a teaspoon of yeast in 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 powder 60 milliliters of milk and a half 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.690
 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 for the cream we will need 500 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.310
 milliliters of cream to mount 40 grams 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.830
 of strawberry jelly and 150 grams of 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.900
 icing sugar as a decoration we will use 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.330
 some red trinkets too 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.520
 we will need a pink coloring that in 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.290
 my case is in gel and I bought it in a 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.050
 online store with very 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.240
 good prices I'll leave the link in the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.160
 description box and we do not know 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.810
 forget the pastry bag with a 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.810
 nozzle that in my case I have chosen 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.700
 smooth and a few paper capsules first thing 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.750
 what we are going to do is mix the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.750
 butter with sugar 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.240
 now we will add the egg 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 and we will integrate everything well 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.760
 now let's pour the milk 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.750
 we will mix the yeast with the flour and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.440
 with vanilla 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 and we are going little by little 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.810
 now we will put the capsules in the mold 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.780
 Now let's fill the capsules 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.990
 and we'll put them 20 minutes to 180 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.990
 degrees 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.650
 once removed from the oven we will leave it 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.870
 cool a bit and meanwhile we will 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.940
 the cream now we will start doing 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.860
 our cream and the first thing we're going to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.440
 do is throw the dye to our 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.150
 cream as it is a gel dye is very 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.830
 powerful so with a little bit that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.830
 let's say let's have enough 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.690
 the next thing we're going to do is ride 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.450
 cream 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.600
 right away we will be adding little by little 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.520
 the icing sugar while continuing to beat and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.160
 when we almost have it assembled 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.020
 we'll add the strawberry gelatin and 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.420
 we will beat for a few minutes so that 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.430
 It integrates well with the cream to me 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.740
 like this rose if you 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.020
 you want to put it more intense you give it a 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.880
 little bit more coloring we will put it in 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.430
 the fridge about three hours so that it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.130
 harden we have our cream ready 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.710
 to start decorating our cupcakes 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.600
 then we will fill our sleeve 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.600
 pastry to start decorating 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.850
 we will take our cupcakes and we will go 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.850
 smearing a little bit over 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.710
 how are we decorating ourselves with cream 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.660
 stock cupcakes are rather for 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.970
 eat them at the moment or 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 keep them in the fridge because if you do not 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.640
 all the cream will fall due to the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.640
 temperature 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.680
 now we will put our final ornament 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.150
 and we already have our delicious 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.550
 Cupcakes ready to eat if you have 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.099
