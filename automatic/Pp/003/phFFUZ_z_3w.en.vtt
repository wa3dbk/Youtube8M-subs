00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.760 

that<00:00:02.909> looks<00:00:03.179> good<00:00:04.460> now<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.520> need<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.740> make<00:00:07.740> this

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
that looks good now we need to make this

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.020 
that looks good now we need to make this
line<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:09.510> end<00:00:09.960> which<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> simple<00:00:11.849> box

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
line and this end which is a simple box

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.400 
line and this end which is a simple box
I<00:00:12.240> think<00:00:12.480> these<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.380> many<00:00:14.009> many<00:00:14.219> many<00:00:14.400> spheres

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
I think these are many many many spheres

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:25.599 
I think these are many many many spheres
so<00:00:16.410> let's<00:00:16.650> make<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:21.769> will<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.400> sphere

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
so let's make this will make one sphere

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.580 
so let's make this will make one sphere
something<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:29.779> maybe<00:00:30.779> smaller<00:00:31.199> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
something like this and maybe smaller so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.770 
something like this and maybe smaller so
let's<00:00:32.070> give<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.460> radius<00:00:32.790> 10<00:00:33.480> points<00:00:34.079> oh<00:00:34.230> wait

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
let's give it a radius 10 points oh wait

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.700 
let's give it a radius 10 points oh wait
maybe<00:00:36.780> 01<00:00:37.620> 09<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:39.350> we're<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.559> duplicate

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
maybe 01 09 and we're going to duplicate

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.819 
maybe 01 09 and we're going to duplicate
it<00:00:41.750> something<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.930> 50<00:00:43.260> times<00:00:45.500> I'm<00:00:46.500> holding

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it something like 50 times I'm holding

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
it something like 50 times I'm holding
shift<00:00:47.690> when<00:00:48.690> i'm<00:00:48.780> doing<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> i'm<00:00:49.170> holding

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
shift when i'm doing this i'm holding

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.430 
shift when i'm doing this i'm holding
shift<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.420> dragging<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.309> sphere<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:54.440> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
shift and dragging the sphere down to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.369 
shift and dragging the sphere down to
create<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.030> we're<00:00:57.360> gonna<00:00:57.510> give<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.840> 50

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
create this so we're gonna give it 50

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.359 
create this so we're gonna give it 50
sphere<00:00:58.710> something<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.309> this<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> big

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
sphere something like this is it big

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
sphere something like this is it big
enough<00:01:05.630> yes<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.380> perfect<00:01:08.689> maybe<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:10.110> little

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
enough yes it's perfect maybe a little

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.910 
enough yes it's perfect maybe a little
bit<00:01:10.770> more<00:01:11.010> spheres<00:01:12.770> take<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> whole<00:01:14.100> thing<00:01:14.430> up

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
bit more spheres take the whole thing up

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
bit more spheres take the whole thing up
to<00:01:16.920> pop<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> duplicate

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to pop here and we're going to duplicate

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.510 
to pop here and we're going to duplicate
the<00:01:21.869> spheres<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:23.689> down<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:27.770> in<00:01:28.770> place

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
the spheres it can down here in place

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.139 
the spheres it can down here in place
and<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.719> reference<00:01:32.079> bottle<00:01:32.469> they<00:01:32.710> get<00:01:33.520> until

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
and the reference bottle they get until

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.539 
and the reference bottle they get until
I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:37.240> maybe<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.159> we're<00:01:39.310> going<00:01:39.429> to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
I think maybe here so we're going to

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.660 
I think maybe here so we're going to
delete<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.939> spheres<00:01:40.390> we<00:01:40.539> don't<00:01:40.750> need<00:01:41.670> we're

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
delete the spheres we don't need we're

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.270 
delete the spheres we don't need we're
going<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:42.909> look<00:01:43.000> at<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:45.549> looks<00:01:45.759> great<00:01:45.969> but

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
going to look at it that looks great but

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.730 
going to look at it that looks great but
you<00:01:48.280> need<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.520> move<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:49.090> spheres<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
you need to move the spheres to the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.319 
you need to move the spheres to the
right<00:01:57.009> little<00:01:57.610> bit<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.890> I<00:01:59.950> think<00:02:03.329> that's

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
right little bit here I think that's

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.469 
right little bit here I think that's
fine<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:06.189> only<00:02:06.340> we<00:02:06.489> need<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.729> connect<00:02:07.090> all<00:02:07.360> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
fine not only we need to connect all the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.150 
fine not only we need to connect all the
spheres<00:02:07.539> together<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.560> we're<00:02:08.739> going<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.979> take

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
spheres together so we're going to take

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.460 
spheres together so we're going to take
one<00:02:09.429> sphere<00:02:09.700> we're<00:02:10.509> going<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.810> convert<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.440> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
one sphere we're going to convert it to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.960 
one sphere we're going to convert it to
editable<00:02:12.069> poly<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:16.060> we're<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> attach

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
editable poly and we're going to attach

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.309 
editable poly and we're going to attach
list<00:02:20.370> all<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.430> spheres<00:02:21.849> in<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.420> scene<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.230> i'm

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
list all the spheres in the scene so i'm

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.880 
list all the spheres in the scene so i'm
going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> write<00:02:23.590> s<00:02:25.620> p-please<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:26.829> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
going to write s p-please going to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.000 
going to write s p-please going to
select<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> spirits<00:02:27.700> by<00:02:27.849> itself<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
select all the spirits by itself and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.920 
select all the spirits by itself and
that's<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.910> we're<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:33.720> connected<00:02:34.720> all<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
that's it we're now connected all the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's it we're now connected all the
spheres<00:02:37.079> now<00:02:38.079> we're<00:02:38.260> going<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.470> create<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
spheres now we're going to create the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.240 
spheres now we're going to create the
box<00:02:41.130> around<00:02:42.130> here<00:02:44.819> I'm<00:02:45.819> going<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> take<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.209> box

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
box around here I'm going to take a box

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.000 
box around here I'm going to take a box
we're<00:02:48.250> gonna<00:02:49.380> create<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.560> something<00:02:50.980> like

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
we're gonna create it something like

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.729 
we're gonna create it something like
this<00:02:51.370> Oh<00:02:53.100> point<00:02:54.100> six<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.920> six<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
this Oh point six and six and in the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.190 
this Oh point six and six and in the
haight<00:03:00.630> 1.22<00:03:01.630> times<00:03:02.260> higher<00:03:03.930> I'm<00:03:04.930> going<00:03:05.079> to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
haight 1.22 times higher I'm going to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.099 
haight 1.22 times higher I'm going to
move<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.470> box<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.970> fits<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.599> end<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
move this box so it fits the end of the

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.860 
move this box so it fits the end of the
spheres<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:09.780> center<00:03:10.780> from<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.349> top<00:03:11.560> viewport

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
spheres the center from the top viewport

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.680 
spheres the center from the top viewport
I'm<00:03:13.870> going<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.079> put<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.319> in<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.650> center<00:03:14.829> of<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
I'm going to put it in the center of the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.530 
I'm going to put it in the center of the
sphere<00:03:17.609> and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
sphere and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.520 
sphere and
I'm<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> convert<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.500> editable<00:03:23.130> poly

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
I'm going to convert it to editable poly

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.740 
I'm going to convert it to editable poly
and<00:03:25.910> take<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:28.290> vertices<00:03:28.620> at<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.460> top<00:03:29.750> make

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
and take the vertices at the top make

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.710 
and take the vertices at the top make
them<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.990> little<00:03:31.080> bit<00:03:31.350> smaller<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:32.280> so

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
them a little bit smaller like so

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.180 
them a little bit smaller like so
because<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:34.110> what<00:03:34.200> happens<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
because that's what happens here in the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.550 
because that's what happens here in the
photo<00:03:36.740> now<00:03:37.740> one<00:03:38.190> more<00:03:38.220> thing<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.840> sides<00:03:40.200> of

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
photo now one more thing the sides of

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.010 
photo now one more thing the sides of
this<00:03:40.860> form<00:03:41.220> are<00:03:41.460> very<00:03:41.700> sharp<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.360> want<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.780> a

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
this form are very sharp I want you a

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.680 
this form are very sharp I want you a
little<00:03:43.800> bit<00:03:44.010> unsure<00:03:44.220> out<00:03:44.430> them<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.000> I'm<00:03:45.420> doing

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
little bit unsure out them and I'm doing

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.200 
little bit unsure out them and I'm doing
this<00:03:45.870> by<00:03:46.380> using<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.860> champ<00:03:47.130> or<00:03:47.340> modifier<00:03:47.790> in

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
this by using the champ or modifier in

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.810 
this by using the champ or modifier in
the<00:03:48.480> edge<00:03:48.660> mode<00:03:49.260> I'm<00:03:49.530> going<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.250> choose<00:03:50.550> all

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
the edge mode I'm going to choose all

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.390 
the edge mode I'm going to choose all
the<00:03:50.970> edges<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.540> then<00:03:52.200> I'm<00:03:52.380> going<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.650> hit<00:03:53.130> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
the edges and then I'm going to hit the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.870 
the edges and then I'm going to hit the
settings<00:03:53.880> near<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.300> chamber<00:03:54.750> modifier<00:03:55.880> so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
settings near the chamber modifier so

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.600 
settings near the chamber modifier so
that's<00:03:57.150> not<00:03:57.420> good<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.930> need<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.740> make<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
that's not good you need to make the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.290 
that's not good you need to make the
chain<00:03:59.790> for<00:03:59.970> much<00:04:00.300> much<00:04:00.540> much<00:04:00.810> smaller<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:03.120> then

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
chain for much much much smaller so then

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.430 
chain for much much much smaller so then
like<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.840> maybe<00:04:04.530> two<00:04:04.830> times<00:04:06.110> now<00:04:07.110> if<00:04:07.320> I

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
like that and maybe two times now if I

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.160 
like that and maybe two times now if I
look<00:04:07.470> at<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.880> can<00:04:08.910> see<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.420> smoother<00:04:09.810> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
look at it you can see it's smoother a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.840 
look at it you can see it's smoother a
little<00:04:10.590> bit<00:04:10.770> if<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.400> look<00:04:11.550> from<00:04:11.670> this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
little bit if you look from this

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.470 
little bit if you look from this
distance<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.510> looks<00:04:12.750> great<00:04:16.700> all<00:04:17.700> right<00:04:17.940> now

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
distance it looks great all right now

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.630 
distance it looks great all right now
again<00:04:19.019> with<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.500> colors<00:04:20.630> make<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.750> all<00:04:21.900> grey

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.420 

that's<00:04:26.640> fine<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:28.370> we<00:04:29.370> have<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.730> lamp<00:04:30.110> now

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
that's fine and we have the lamp now

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.180 
that's fine and we have the lamp now
we're<00:04:32.430> going<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.760> create<00:04:33.800> these<00:04:34.800> little

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
we're going to create these little

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.490 
we're going to create these little
things<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:35.610> hold<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.390> Chinese<00:04:37.290> work

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
things that hold the Chinese work

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.590 
things that hold the Chinese work
together<00:04:37.710> there's<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.610> line<00:04:38.910> here<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.270> think

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
together there's a line here I think

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.200 
together there's a line here I think
it's<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.840> box<00:04:40.080> from<00:04:40.919> this<00:04:41.160> side<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.460> maybe<00:04:41.880> that

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
it's a box from this side and maybe that

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.659 
it's a box from this side and maybe that
side<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:44.450> it<00:04:45.450> holds<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.200> roof<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.460> roof

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
side and it holds this roof to this roof

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.630 
side and it holds this roof to this roof
and<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.780> box<00:04:49.080> up<00:04:49.470> here<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.430> we're<00:04:50.520> going

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
and to that box up here so we're going

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.940 
and to that box up here so we're going
to<00:04:50.729> create<00:04:50.910> this<00:04:51.210> point<00:04:51.540> I'm<00:04:52.350> going<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.710> go<00:04:52.890> to

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
to create this point I'm going to go to

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.270 
to create this point I'm going to go to
front<00:04:53.820> viewport<00:04:54.090> i'm<00:04:54.979> going<00:04:55.979> to<00:04:56.100> create<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.400> box

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
front viewport i'm going to create a box

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.110 
front viewport i'm going to create a box
that's<00:04:59.280> holding<00:05:00.180> this<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:01.290> goes<00:05:02.120> kill

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
that's holding this and goes kill

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.680 
that's holding this and goes kill
something<00:05:03.780> sorry<00:05:04.880> though<00:05:05.880> still<00:05:06.210> something

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
something sorry though still something

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.460 
something sorry though still something
like

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
like

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.510 
like
here<00:05:09.670> now<00:05:10.670> solving<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.360> whole<00:05:11.570> firm<00:05:11.900> together

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
here now solving the whole firm together

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.670 
here now solving the whole firm together
form<00:05:13.520> together<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:16.030> think<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.570> bends<00:05:17.930> inside

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
form together so I think it bends inside

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.920 
form together so I think it bends inside
now<00:05:19.490> when<00:05:19.670> you<00:05:19.700> then<00:05:20.000> don't<00:05:20.240> have<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.540> reference

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
now when you then don't have a reference

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.500 
now when you then don't have a reference
photo<00:05:21.260> all<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.830> object<00:05:22.190> itself<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:23.180> need<00:05:23.330> to

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
photo all the object itself you need to

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.410 
photo all the object itself you need to
take<00:05:23.950> educated<00:05:24.950> guesses<00:05:25.370> so<00:05:25.970> I<00:05:26.030> hope<00:05:26.210> you

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
take educated guesses so I hope you

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.600 
take educated guesses so I hope you
guess<00:05:27.100> I'll<00:05:28.100> say<00:05:28.610> this<00:05:28.880> line<00:05:30.070> stop<00:05:31.070> this<00:05:31.280> thick

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
guess I'll say this line stop this thick

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.410 
guess I'll say this line stop this thick
and<00:05:32.770> in<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.920> front<00:05:34.190> viewport<00:05:34.490> i'm<00:05:34.970> going<00:05:35.300> to

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
and in the front viewport i'm going to

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.070 
and in the front viewport i'm going to
add<00:05:37.750> length<00:05:38.750> segments<00:05:40.090> which<00:05:41.090> i'm<00:05:41.480> going<00:05:41.960> to

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
add length segments which i'm going to

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.270 
add length segments which i'm going to
use<00:05:42.290> to<00:05:42.620> bend<00:05:42.920> the<00:05:43.100> form<00:05:43.430> so<00:05:43.790> it<00:05:43.820> goes<00:05:44.180> and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
use to bend the form so it goes and

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.160 
use to bend the form so it goes and
touches<00:05:46.280> both<00:05:46.730> Chinese<00:05:47.420> roots<00:05:49.930> convert<00:05:50.930> to

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
touches both Chinese roots convert to

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.170 
touches both Chinese roots convert to
editable<00:05:51.470> for<00:05:52.100> me<00:05:52.250> again<00:05:52.810> take<00:05:53.810> these<00:05:54.050> points

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
editable for me again take these points

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.540 
editable for me again take these points
and<00:05:56.180> move<00:05:56.420> them<00:05:56.650> now<00:05:58.090> this<00:05:59.090> form<00:05:59.470> do<00:06:00.470> this<00:06:00.620> here

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
and move them now this form do this here

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.040 
and move them now this form do this here
this<00:06:02.270> goes<00:06:02.690> here<00:06:03.400> now<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:04.580> forms<00:06:04.970> is<00:06:05.180> it<00:06:05.510> this

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
this goes here now this forms is it this

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.810 
this goes here now this forms is it this
form<00:06:06.320> is<00:06:06.470> held<00:06:06.770> by<00:06:07.100> this<00:06:08.200> box<00:06:09.200> and<00:06:09.550> it<00:06:10.550> touches

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
form is held by this box and it touches

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.890 
form is held by this box and it touches
the<00:06:11.270> first<00:06:11.660> group<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.200> then<00:06:12.770> it<00:06:12.950> touches<00:06:13.340> the

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
the first group and then it touches the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.980 
the first group and then it touches the
second<00:06:14.900> move<00:06:16.900> then<00:06:17.900> it<00:06:18.080> goes<00:06:18.290> something<00:06:18.590> like

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
second move then it goes something like

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.220 
second move then it goes something like
maybe<00:06:20.990> touch<00:06:21.890> second<00:06:22.460> loop<00:06:22.610> here<00:06:22.940> then<00:06:23.810> it

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
maybe touch second loop here then it

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.310 
maybe touch second loop here then it
holds<00:06:24.620> it<00:06:24.740> like<00:06:24.980> so<00:06:25.810> so<00:06:26.810> if<00:06:26.900> we<00:06:26.960> look<00:06:27.050> at<00:06:27.260> the

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
holds it like so so if we look at the

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.170 
holds it like so so if we look at the
farm<00:06:27.620> in<00:06:28.430> 3d<00:06:28.880> you<00:06:29.170> can<00:06:30.170> see<00:06:30.730> that's<00:06:31.730> attached

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
farm in 3d you can see that's attached

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.950 
farm in 3d you can see that's attached
here<00:06:32.570> it's<00:06:33.500> holding<00:06:33.890> the<00:06:33.950> form<00:06:34.370> in<00:06:35.120> this<00:06:35.690> spot

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
here it's holding the form in this spot

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.020 
here it's holding the form in this spot
and<00:06:36.320> then<00:06:36.950> it's<00:06:37.130> holding<00:06:37.400> the<00:06:37.460> form<00:06:37.790> in<00:06:37.880> this

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
and then it's holding the form in this

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.530 
and then it's holding the form in this
place<00:06:38.800> so<00:06:39.800> in<00:06:40.310> real<00:06:40.610> life<00:06:40.820> I<00:06:41.030> think<00:06:41.090> it<00:06:41.360> would

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
place so in real life I think it would

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.680 
place so in real life I think it would
look<00:06:41.960> something<00:06:42.230> like<00:06:42.470> this<00:06:43.060> I'm<00:06:44.060> gonna<00:06:44.300> leave

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
look something like this I'm gonna leave

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.880 
look something like this I'm gonna leave
it<00:06:44.840> be<00:06:46.210> maybe<00:06:47.210> a<00:06:47.360> little<00:06:47.630> less<00:06:48.080> thick<00:06:48.440> here<00:06:48.710> so

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
it be maybe a little less thick here so

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.470 
it be maybe a little less thick here so
I'm<00:06:48.980> going<00:06:49.220> to<00:06:49.310> take<00:06:49.490> these<00:06:49.700> points<00:06:50.180> and<00:06:50.330> move

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
I'm going to take these points and move

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.520 
I'm going to take these points and move
them<00:06:51.310> like<00:06:52.310> so<00:06:52.640> then<00:06:53.450> you<00:06:53.630> move<00:06:53.810> them<00:06:53.990> closer

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
them like so then you move them closer

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
them like so then you move them closer
together<00:06:55.810> like<00:06:56.810> so<00:06:58.180> and<00:06:59.180> I<00:06:59.750> think<00:07:00.080> that's<00:07:00.290> fine

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
together like so and I think that's fine

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.390 
together like so and I think that's fine
I'm<00:07:01.550> going<00:07:01.790> to<00:07:01.880> duplicate<00:07:02.030> it<00:07:02.360> or<00:07:03.100> rather<00:07:04.100> i'm

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
I'm going to duplicate it or rather i'm

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.680 
I'm going to duplicate it or rather i'm
going<00:07:04.760> to<00:07:04.940> mirror<00:07:05.540> it<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:07.160> other<00:07:07.340> side<00:07:07.690> i'm

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
going to mirror it the other side i'm

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.760 
going to mirror it the other side i'm
going<00:07:08.930> to<00:07:09.020> copy<00:07:09.260> the<00:07:09.680> mirror<00:07:09.860> and<00:07:10.210> place<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.770> on

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
going to copy the mirror and place it on

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.320 
going to copy the mirror and place it on
the<00:07:12.980> other<00:07:13.190> side<00:07:13.490> of<00:07:13.520> the<00:07:13.730> phone<00:07:13.970> because<00:07:14.710> now

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 
probably there are two lines in for one

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.790 
probably there are two lines in for one
on<00:07:21.569> this<00:07:21.690> side<00:07:21.930> one<00:07:22.289> on<00:07:22.319> this<00:07:22.560> side<00:07:23.150> all<00:07:24.150> right
