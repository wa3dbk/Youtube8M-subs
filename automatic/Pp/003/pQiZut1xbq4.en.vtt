about any of that stuff and it helps

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130 
about any of that stuff and it helps
prolong<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> life<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> batteries<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
prolong the life of the batteries the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.660 
prolong the life of the batteries the
other<00:01:10.290> thing<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.190> charge

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
other thing is that you can charge

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
other thing is that you can charge
multiple<00:01:12.330> batteries<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:13.380> have

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
multiple batteries and they don't have

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.860 
multiple batteries and they don't have
to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.710> same<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.550> that<00:01:15.390> helps<00:01:15.720> out

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
to be the same thing so that helps out

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
to be the same thing so that helps out
here<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.440> have<00:01:16.710> an<00:01:16.800> 18<00:01:17.070> 650<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:21.380> also<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
here I have an 18 650 I also have the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
here I have an 18 650 I also have the
nickel<00:01:23.130> metal<00:01:23.220> hydride<00:01:23.400> battery<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.330> over

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
nickel metal hydride battery up over

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.890 
nickel metal hydride battery up over
here<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.610> you'll<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.970> it'll<00:01:30.300> start<00:01:30.690> off

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
here and you'll see that it'll start off

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.740 
here and you'll see that it'll start off
and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.230> go<00:01:31.440> up<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.310> detecting<00:01:33.030> what

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and then go up as it's detecting what

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.890 
and then go up as it's detecting what
needs<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> happen<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.980> go<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.900> then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
needs to happen there we go and then

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
needs to happen there we go and then
once<00:01:37.050> they're<00:01:37.230> done<00:01:37.380> obviously<00:01:37.560> it'll<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
once they're done obviously it'll go to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.460 
once they're done obviously it'll go to
the<00:01:39.780> top<00:01:40.080> here<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.790> cr123<00:01:42.780> show<00:01:43.410> you
