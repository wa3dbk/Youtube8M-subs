00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 on the channel or not that the fast video I 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.429
 I was thus memory to explain the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.500
 size of coruna and also some 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.679
 things that are asking for much that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 Let me explain and explain to me the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.050
 you you is not the first time that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.390
 I'm here taking the butt 11 82 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 centimeters 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.660
 you have to focus on the ground cutting cut 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 have to be 39 centimeters because this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.329
 range here will depend on your size 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
 understood 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.670
 according to its size it has to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.100
 be supported like this will 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 stay to get well let's shoot 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.270
 understood in his corner in one here and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 Rest your trigger finger ready 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:01.940
 When you obeyed, this is from here to here. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:04.019
 you leave your 40 to 50 centimeters 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.390
 from here to here 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:13.619
 then you cut between 50 cents 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.729
 and making rock of 39 make a cut of 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.460
 39 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.340
 You come here here, remembering that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:32.130
 we did it by measuring it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:36.900
 it would be 50 centimeters from here you pick up 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.409
 from here I ceded the size of 12 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.200
 cm trigger the post that will 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 be this here in this trigger in seven 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 centimeters 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.090
 here you do it the same way you are 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 here to get the ball here it goes 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.030
 the Christian, and that part here is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 where is the trigger that he when you 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.020
 lapa will pull the shake invaded the street 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.619
 here in the corner you're pulling it goes 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.530
 go down 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.390
 that's all you have to deserve. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.990
 size because the color a pipe 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.990
 in the kitten it has to stay accurate here 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.020
 It came right 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:32.670
 You do not have to stay if it's just getting 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:42.180
 so you make the cut here does not exist 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:43.800
 no record here and another normal course 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.290
 Another thing I'll tell you both. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.860
 you is not fast when you use your 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.730
 starts here she thinks of what 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:01.410
 it's going to cover is for the student to pass do not do 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.540
 so that part return two two gloves 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.110
 25 did not have sex demonstration 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.200
 two moons you put a world is in 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.230
 of a barrel of 25 will fit normal and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.850
 leave a space so it will stay the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.549
 murray thinks of the fence that goes 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.900
 close this part here and let 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.430
 ending this part here leaves only one 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.540
 little piece that will stay like this 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.260
 to buy a glove of 25 with 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:37.850
 these drones here or $ 5 against 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.850
 she and you will put her in the fit 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.209
 in box here is soon this fight here with 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.709
 You put her in too much 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.780
 talent, you pass some tape 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.329
 inside to be able to stay 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.120
 going outside to learn more there and 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.640
 here you get that emery 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.040
 leave a little bit just to do another 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.920
 another entrance of the city here to put 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.530
 another little rock like that 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.079
 I voted and was rude and stay dropping 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.650
 so I have to do it there, stay 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.959
 good 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.430
 she got the two parties here do not 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.049
 will let you through 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.419
 and here you will screw that part 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.940
 here in the front here in the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.160
 then it will not just come out 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.990
 screw understood or getting stuck here 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.259
 on this street 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.250
 It happens in a step from the uta you 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:33.620
 leave the xbox and leave so this was 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.610
 here's a scolding 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.970
 I do not know the size 6 average there the vacancy 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.660
 Rodrigo lets himself go like this never 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.479
 read 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.650
 he will come in with a little time off with 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.509
 Slack for you to put this part here. 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.520
 in the corner taking a rift with the hand 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:58.639
 live speaking also you go there 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.840
 Simulating oil it can use ae 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.750
 or those people a long time it goes 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.270
 to dry vote this part here to stay 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.830
 like this 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.349
 I think you put it before you do 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.830
 this cut that you actually put 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.830
 here o 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.300
 you are going to put on the attack and 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.599
 center in the middle and who to stay 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.150
 centralized beyond what is very annoying 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.500
 put this deal to know 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.240
 personally the rubbers for you 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:44.360
 centralize its first centralization 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:46.210
 it puts centralized and looks like it is 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.349
 that will stay 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.750
 center soon 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.349
 when it is centralized that he stays like this 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:03.199
 oh you can measure the cuts 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:05.210
 remembering that the cuts will stay 28 and 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.770
 middle of the pipe 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.770
 from here to 28
