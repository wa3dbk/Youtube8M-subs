00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 here is the brighton cgn classical guitar 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.460
 for beginners so let's see what 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.049
 that this guitar has in the belly 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 obviously like all guitars 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.690
 classics we have a very round sound of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.359
 very nice very round bass and the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.800
 treble too are accurate but with a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.800
 some candor some heat 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 so for those who want to start 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 in the classical guitar will offer you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 all the palettes of sounds that can 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.130
 that we can imagine in an instrument 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.750
 such as this one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.760
 so you really have an idea of ​​what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.399
 what can give a guitar a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.750
 classical guitar 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.280
 you will play nails with your right hand 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.230
 so you will have a little more acute sound 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.730
 than what it gives here I play 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.420
 without the nails so we have something 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.420
 a little bit rounder 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.620
 but we really have these guitar 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.620
 very hot classic then 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.160
 here we have two notes that sounds good 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.690
 Basque people who remain very 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.360
 interesting for an inhabitant who wants to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.190
 put in the classics but also not 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.510
 necessarily someone who will go to 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.300
 classics but someone who will want 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.470
 to play flamenco maybe where we are 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.910
 not have to play the classic of the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.970
 flamenco to play on a guitar to 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.230
 nylon strings so in flamenco by 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.500
 example of rhythm sounds great 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.500
 as well 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.640
 solo it works very well 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.420
 and then nothing prevents you from playing 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 other songs on a guitar 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 classical 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.600
 this guitar also exists in 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.920
 several sizes so much for the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.070
 adults only for children ranging from 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.180
 a quarter to 3 1/2 k so everyone 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.180
 can find his happiness
