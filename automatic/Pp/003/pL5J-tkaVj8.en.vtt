techniques<00:00:08.340> we're<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.269> learning

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
techniques we're going to be learning

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.999 
techniques we're going to be learning
how<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:09.990> stencil<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.000> I<00:00:12.049> have<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> stencil<00:00:13.980> that

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
how to stencil and I have a stencil that

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.310 
how to stencil and I have a stencil that
I've<00:00:14.340> cut<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.820> myself<00:00:15.059> which<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.630> basically<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
I've cut out myself which is basically a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.460 
I've cut out myself which is basically a
spray<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> roses<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.880> lots<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.330> leaves<00:00:18.570> so

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
spray of roses with lots of leaves so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.849 
spray of roses with lots of leaves so
instead<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.330> doing<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.689> more<00:00:22.080> traditional

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
instead of doing the more traditional

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.120 
instead of doing the more traditional
way<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.930> using<00:00:24.930> colors<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.529> would<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.859> green

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
way of using colors which would be green

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.859 
way of using colors which would be green
stems<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.000> leaves<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.779> possibly<00:00:28.199> red<00:00:29.070> roses

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
stems and leaves and possibly red roses

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.930 
stems and leaves and possibly red roses
we're<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.489> color

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we're just going to do it in one color

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.440 
we're just going to do it in one color
which<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.840> probably<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.180> update<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
which is probably going to update the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.920 
which is probably going to update the
look<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.469> large<00:00:37.800> degree<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.399> well<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.690> have

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
look to a large degree as well so I have

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900 
look to a large degree as well so I have
a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.410> bit<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> artists<00:00:41.129> color<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a little bit of artists color it's a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.819 
a little bit of artists color it's a
brown<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.579> important<00:00:45.270> tool

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
brown I have a very very important tool

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.650 
brown I have a very very important tool
paper<00:00:46.829> towels<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.000> offload<00:00:48.600> your

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
paper towels which you offload your

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.580 
paper towels which you offload your
brush<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.280> stencil<00:00:50.820> brush<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.379> key

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
brush on and a stencil brush so the key

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.490 
brush on and a stencil brush so the key
is<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.039> dab<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.719> bit<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> paint

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
is to dab on a little bit of the paint

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.279 
is to dab on a little bit of the paint
offload<00:00:56.570> try<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.559> lot<00:00:59.340> of<00:01:00.020> paint<00:01:01.020> on

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
offload try not to get a lot of paint on

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.399 
offload try not to get a lot of paint on
your<00:01:01.739> stencil<00:01:02.250> brush<00:01:02.629> because<00:01:03.629> it'll<00:01:04.110> start

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
your stencil brush because it'll start

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.070 
your stencil brush because it'll start
bleeding<00:01:04.830> under<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.500> stencil<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.450> using<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
bleeding under the stencil so using a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.890 
bleeding under the stencil so using a
circular<00:01:10.680> motion<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:13.880> applied<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.299> color

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
circular motion you applied the color

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
circular motion you applied the color
into<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.770> stencil<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.380> also<00:01:19.860> stipple<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
into the stencil you can also stipple it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.719 
into the stencil you can also stipple it
in<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.930> usually<00:01:22.229> works<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.950> nicely<00:01:23.280> if

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
in but it usually works really nicely if

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.469 
in but it usually works really nicely if
you<00:01:23.970> use<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.140> circular<00:01:26.630> stroke<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:29.299> one<00:01:30.299> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you use this circular stroke and one of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 
you use this circular stroke and one of
the<00:01:30.689> ideas<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.500> you're<00:01:31.770> using<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.729> stencil

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the ideas when you're using a stencil

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.890 
the ideas when you're using a stencil
such<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.049> let's<00:01:34.470> say<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.600> wall<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.869> your

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
such as this let's say on a wall in your

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.539 
such as this let's say on a wall in your
room<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.570> randomly<00:01:40.560> place<00:01:41.040> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
room is that you can randomly place this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
room is that you can randomly place this
stencil<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.810> flip<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> over<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
stencil you know flip it over have a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.580 
stencil you know flip it over have a
mirror<00:01:44.340> image<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:48.240> work<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
mirror image or you can just work on the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.399 
mirror image or you can just work on the
same<00:01:49.860> image<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.149> randomly<00:01:51.840> spaced

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
same image but you know randomly spaced

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.359 
same image but you know randomly spaced
out<00:01:52.680> over<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.340> wall

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.249 

it's<00:02:01.369> also<00:02:01.520> important<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.360> remember<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:03.080> you

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
it's also important to remember that you

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.910 
it's also important to remember that you
don't<00:02:03.290> want<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.700> same<00:02:05.090> amount<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.690> paint<00:02:06.049> in

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
don't want the same amount of paint in

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.960 
don't want the same amount of paint in
every<00:02:07.850> opening<00:02:09.069> because<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:11.080> how<00:02:12.080> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
every opening because that is how it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.000 
every opening because that is how it
naturally<00:02:13.970> looks<00:02:14.840> more<00:02:15.110> beautiful<00:02:17.620> now<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
naturally looks more beautiful now the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.470 
naturally looks more beautiful now the
time<00:02:19.250> for<00:02:19.280> us<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.910> lift<00:02:20.239> off<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.840> stencil<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
time for us to lift off the stencil and

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.740 
time for us to lift off the stencil and
try<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.720> different<00:02:30.050> technique<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:32.390> bring

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
try a different technique just bring

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.850 
try a different technique just bring
this<00:02:32.930> back<00:02:33.319> up<00:02:33.350> here<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:38.090> time<00:02:38.500> use<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
this back up here and this time use a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.259 
this back up here and this time use a
roller<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.739> using<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.340> same<00:02:43.610> paint

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
roller which is using the same paint

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.250 
roller which is using the same paint
that<00:02:44.630> we<00:02:44.810> used<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> brush<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:47.269> again<00:02:47.870> very

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
that we used on the brush but again very

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.030 
that we used on the brush but again very
very<00:02:48.350> important<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.250> offload<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:51.530> amount<00:02:51.860> of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
very important to offload the amount of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.080 
very important to offload the amount of
color<00:02:52.310> on<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.640> roller<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:55.430> find<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:55.910> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
color on the roller and I find that a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.190 
color on the roller and I find that a
foam<00:02:56.450> roller<00:02:58.390> distributes<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.600> paint<00:02:59.840> much

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
foam roller distributes the paint much

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.039 
foam roller distributes the paint much
more<00:03:00.470> evenly<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.329> obviously<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.840> much

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
more evenly this is obviously a much

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.199 
more evenly this is obviously a much
quicker<00:03:03.380> way<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.920> doing<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.049> can<00:03:06.230> see

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
quicker way of doing it but you can see
