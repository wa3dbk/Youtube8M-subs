this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.830> neat<00:00:32.309> computer<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> seems<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
this is a very neat computer it seems to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.150 
this is a very neat computer it seems to
be<00:00:33.840> very<00:00:33.870> thin<00:00:34.380> I'll<00:00:34.500> show<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> profile

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
be very thin I'll show you the profile

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.250 
be very thin I'll show you the profile
of<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.300> super<00:00:36.660> duper<00:00:36.870> 10<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.140> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of it it's not super duper 10 but it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
of it it's not super duper 10 but it's
it's<00:00:37.829> relatively<00:00:38.340> thin<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.180> has<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it's relatively thin but it has all the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.389 
it's relatively thin but it has all the
connectivity<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> desktop<00:00:40.680> PC<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.250> top

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
connectivity of a desktop PC and on top

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
connectivity of a desktop PC and on top
of<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.790> has<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> vesa<00:00:42.329> mount<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> back

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
of that it has a vesa mount on the back

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.420 
of that it has a vesa mount on the back
so<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.680> mount<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.250> your

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so you can actually mount this on your

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
so you can actually mount this on your
wall<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> want<00:00:45.270> something<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
wall so if you want something in the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
wall so if you want something in the
kitchen<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.950> right<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.520> alley<00:00:47.670> but

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
kitchen this is right up your alley but

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
kitchen this is right up your alley but
don't<00:00:48.930> cut<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> know<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.070> give<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
don't cut it you know don't give it a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
don't cut it you know don't give it a
any<00:00:50.700> slack<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.480> pretty<00:00:51.660> powerful

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
any slack it's actually pretty powerful

any slack it's actually pretty powerful
this<00:00:52.320> thing<00:00:52.500> does<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.190> intel<00:00:53.489> core<00:00:53.520> i3

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
this thing does have an intel core i3

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
this thing does have an intel core i3
it's<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.050> 2100<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it's the 2100 which is one of the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's the 2100 which is one of the
fastest<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.930> least<00:00:58.140> frequency<00:00:58.649> why<00:00:58.800> CPUs<00:00:59.370> it's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
fastest at least frequency why CPUs it's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 
fastest at least frequency why CPUs it's
a<00:00:59.609> 3.1<00:01:00.390> Giga<00:01:00.899> heard<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.680> display<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
a 3.1 Giga heard this display is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.750 
a 3.1 Giga heard this display is
actually<00:01:02.850> 23<00:01:03.270> inches<00:01:03.539> diagonally<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.760> 1920

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
actually 23 inches diagonally it's 1920

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.940 
actually 23 inches diagonally it's 1920
x<00:01:05.850> 1080<00:01:06.000> p<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> we'll<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.990> HD<00:01:07.409> videos<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> can
