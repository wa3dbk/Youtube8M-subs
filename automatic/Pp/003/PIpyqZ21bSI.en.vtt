00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
coming to you guys with a tutorial on

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.740 
coming to you guys with a tutorial on
last-hitting

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750

this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.349> an<00:00:13.500> advanced<00:00:13.980> technique<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.549> will

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
this is an advanced technique that will

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.369 
this is an advanced technique that will
help<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.940> guys<00:00:15.120> take<00:00:15.450> down<00:00:15.719> enemies<00:00:16.199> with

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
help you guys take down enemies with

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.680 
help you guys take down enemies with
high<00:00:16.560> defence<00:00:17.039> such<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.699> turtles<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.390> crabs

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
high defence such as turtles and crabs

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
high defence such as turtles and crabs
very<00:00:19.470> efficiently<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.400> pretty<00:00:21.150> much<00:00:21.300> will

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
very efficiently and pretty much will

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.330 
very efficiently and pretty much will
ensure<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> maximum<00:00:22.859> number

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
ensure that you get the maximum number

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.920 
ensure that you get the maximum number
of<00:00:23.400> hits<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.269> way<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.480> don't<00:00:24.660> end<00:00:24.869> up

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
of hits in that way you don't end up

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.990 
of hits in that way you don't end up
taking<00:00:25.109> extra<00:00:25.650> damage<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> didn't<00:00:26.880> mean

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
taking extra damage that you didn't mean

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960 
taking extra damage that you didn't mean
to<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.960> without<00:00:28.859> further<00:00:29.039> ado<00:00:29.340> let's<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.789> into

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to so without further ado let's get into

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.959 
to so without further ado let's get into
what<00:00:30.000> its<00:00:30.630> technique<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.550> essentially<00:00:32.550> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
what its technique is essentially it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.020 
what its technique is essentially it
revolves<00:00:33.450> around<00:00:33.540> getting<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.680> most<00:00:35.030> hits

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
revolves around getting the most hits

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.420 
revolves around getting the most hits
out<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.480> combo<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.170> possible<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.250> for

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
out of your combo as possible and for

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.260 
out of your combo as possible and for
those<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> guys<00:00:38.760> who<00:00:38.910> don't<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.090> what

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
those of you guys who don't know what

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.470 
those of you guys who don't know what
combo<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.950> combo<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.550> number<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> hits

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
combo is combo is the number of hits

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.590 
combo is combo is the number of hits
that<00:00:42.719> each<00:00:43.350> unit<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.370> deal<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.149> opposing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that each unit will deal to the opposing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.350 
that each unit will deal to the opposing
enemy<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.610> number<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.670> his<00:00:47.820> varies<00:00:48.210> from

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
enemy now number of his varies from

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
enemy now number of his varies from
character<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> character<00:00:49.010> but<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.039> doesn't

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
character to character but that doesn't

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.369 
character to character but that doesn't
mean<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:50.940> their<00:00:51.629> damage<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.230> many

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
mean that they do their damage that many

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
mean that they do their damage that many
times<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.800> means<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.370> takes<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
times it just means that it takes that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
times it just means that it takes that
many<00:00:53.940> hits<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.809> deal<00:00:54.989> their<00:00:55.170> overall<00:00:55.649> damage

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
many hits to deal their overall damage

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
many hits to deal their overall damage
so<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.239> instance<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> blue

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
so for instance if we look at the blue

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.790 
so for instance if we look at the blue
penguin<00:00:59.219> blue<00:01:00.120> penguin<00:01:00.480> has<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> combo<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.469> five

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
penguin blue penguin has a combo of five

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
penguin blue penguin has a combo of five
that<00:01:02.190> means<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.699> hit<00:01:02.850> five<00:01:03.539> times

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that means that it will hit five times

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
that means that it will hit five times
and<00:01:04.379> normally<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.580> irrelevant<00:01:05.909> because

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and normally this is irrelevant because

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
and normally this is irrelevant because
all<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.720> matters<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> damage<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
all that matters is the damage that you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.490 
all that matters is the damage that you
deal<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> come<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.659> characters

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
deal but when you come to characters

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950 
deal but when you come to characters
with<00:01:10.650> high<00:01:10.860> defense<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.520> crabs<00:01:11.880> Turtles<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
with high defense like crabs Turtles the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750 
with high defense like crabs Turtles the
archers<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.740> normally<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> elite

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
archers that are normally on the elite

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
archers that are normally on the elite
islands<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.780> guys<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.200> only<00:01:16.350> take<00:01:16.650> one

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
islands these guys will only take one

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460 
islands these guys will only take one
damage<00:01:17.220> per<00:01:17.880> hit<00:01:17.909> unless<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> deal<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
damage per hit unless you deal a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
damage per hit unless you deal a
ridiculous<00:01:20.130> amount<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> damage<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.909> bypass

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
ridiculous amount of damage to bypass

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
ridiculous amount of damage to bypass
their<00:01:21.750> defense<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:22.920> cases<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.490> just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
their defense in some cases they just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.090 
their defense in some cases they just
can't<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.740> with<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:25.890> guys

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
can't do that so with these guys

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.560 
can't do that so with these guys
especially<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> archers<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.390> will

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
especially with the archers that will

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
especially with the archers that will
kill<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.020> hit<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.189> important

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
kill you in one hit it's very important

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.039 
kill you in one hit it's very important
that<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> deal<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> maximum<00:01:30.540> number<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> hits

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that you deal the maximum number of hits

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.640 
that you deal the maximum number of hits
that<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.700> die<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.650> what

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that you can so you don't die so what

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.380 
that you can so you don't die so what
exactly<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.310> technique<00:01:35.790> well

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
exactly is this technique well

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.530 
exactly is this technique well
essentially<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
essentially what you do is that you

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
essentially what you do is that you
attack<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:39.780> unit<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.829> once

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
attack with your unit and then once

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 
attack with your unit and then once
you've<00:01:41.310> dealt<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> number<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.119> hits<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you've dealt the number of hits you the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
you've dealt the number of hits you the
maximum<00:01:44.070> number<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.430> hits<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.270> you'll<00:01:45.509> move

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
maximum number of hits then you'll move

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
maximum number of hits then you'll move
on<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.200> character<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> seems

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
on to the other character and it seems

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.010 
on to the other character and it seems
simple<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.700> let<00:01:48.450> me<00:01:48.540> explain<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.930> guys

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
simple but let me explain to you guys

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050 
simple but let me explain to you guys
how<00:01:49.409> exactly<00:01:49.829> combos<00:01:50.250> work<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.729> why<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
how exactly combos work and why it's a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.830 
how exactly combos work and why it's a
bit<00:01:51.210> more<00:01:51.390> tricky

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
bit more tricky

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.859 
bit more tricky
now<00:01:52.380> combos<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.549> way<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> works<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.149> let's<00:01:54.720> say

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
now combos the way it works is let's say

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.300 
now combos the way it works is let's say
like<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.140> talked<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.710> blue<00:01:55.890> penguin

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like I talked about the blue penguin

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
like I talked about the blue penguin
that<00:01:56.549> deals<00:01:56.759> combo<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.299> five<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:58.350> means<00:01:58.560> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that deals combo of five that means that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219 
that deals combo of five that means that
if<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.880> press<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.450> penguin<00:02:00.899> button

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
if you just press the penguin button

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
if you just press the penguin button
you're<00:02:02.040> gonna<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.369> automatically<00:02:02.909> two<00:02:03.210> hits

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you're gonna get automatically two hits

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.200 
you're gonna get automatically two hits
no<00:02:03.659> matter<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.560> always<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.610> number

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
no matter what you always get the number

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
no matter what you always get the number
of<00:02:06.299> combo<00:02:06.630> minus<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.229> hits<00:02:07.890> guaranteed

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
of combo minus three hits guaranteed

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.270 
of combo minus three hits guaranteed
then<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> good<00:02:10.379> you'll<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.039> an

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
then if you get a good you'll get an

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
then if you get a good you'll get an
extra<00:02:11.730> hit<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.030> three<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
extra hit so it's three if you get a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.670 
extra hit so it's three if you get a
great<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.230> four

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
great that's four

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
great that's four
and<00:02:13.799> she<00:02:14.010> hit<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.189> perfect<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.879> five

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
and she hit a perfect that's five

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.830 
and she hit a perfect that's five
however<00:02:16.129> you<00:02:17.129> know<00:02:17.250> other<00:02:17.519> ways<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.329> get<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
however you know other ways to get the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
however you know other ways to get the
five<00:02:19.140> other<00:02:19.650> than<00:02:19.950> getting<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.430> perfect<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
five other than getting a perfect and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.970 
five other than getting a perfect and
that<00:02:21.090> or<00:02:21.629> there's<00:02:22.200> only<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:22.560> way<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
that or there's only one way to do it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.300 
that or there's only one way to do it
and<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.159> is<00:02:23.219> just<00:02:24.409> don't<00:02:25.409> hit<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:25.650> press

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and that is just don't hit don't press

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
and that is just don't hit don't press
the<00:02:26.459> button<00:02:26.489> at<00:02:26.969> all<00:02:27.000> if<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.870> don't<00:02:27.959> press<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the button at all if you don't press the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.140 
the button at all if you don't press the
button<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.709> it'll<00:02:29.040> go<00:02:29.159> past<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.670> perfect

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
button at all it'll go past the perfect

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.849 
button at all it'll go past the perfect
timing<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.900> actually<00:02:31.230> end<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.560> getting<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
timing and you actually end up getting a

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.520 
timing and you actually end up getting a
miss<00:02:32.129> but<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.120> an<00:02:33.239> early<00:02:33.569> miss<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.019> lateness

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
miss but not an early miss a lateness

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.539 
miss but not an early miss a lateness
that's<00:02:34.799> why<00:02:34.859> I<00:02:34.920> call<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.099> late<00:02:35.310> hitting

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
that's why I call it late hitting

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.750 
that's why I call it late hitting
because<00:02:36.359> essentially<00:02:36.780> you're<00:02:37.049> trying<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.760> hit

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
because essentially you're trying to hit

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.270 
because essentially you're trying to hit
the<00:02:38.909> button<00:02:39.060> as<00:02:39.239> late<00:02:39.719> as<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.290> now<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.010> can

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
the button as late as you can now we can

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.619 
the button as late as you can now we can
ensure<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.939> maximum<00:02:42.090> number

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
ensure that you get the maximum number

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.539 
ensure that you get the maximum number
of<00:02:42.659> hits<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:43.859> before<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.250> move<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.459> to

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
of hits and then before you move on to

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.830 
of hits and then before you move on to
the<00:02:44.639> other<00:02:44.760> character<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.359> so<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:45.659> why

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the other character and so that's why

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.750 
the other character and so that's why
it's<00:02:46.349> kind<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.620> counterintuitive<00:02:47.010> if<00:02:47.639> you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it's kind of counterintuitive if you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.159 
it's kind of counterintuitive if you
want<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:47.970> hit<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.180> most<00:02:48.419> number<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> hits<00:02:49.049> you

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
want to hit the most number of hits you

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.659 
want to hit the most number of hits you
think<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.769> need<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.189> perfect

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
think if you need to get it perfect

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.429 
think if you need to get it perfect
which<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> used<00:02:51.419> to<00:02:51.510> think<00:02:51.659> but<00:02:52.169> really

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
which is what I used to think but really

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.920 
which is what I used to think but really
I<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.859> is<00:02:53.099> gonna<00:02:53.459> miss<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:54.239> late<00:02:54.659> miss

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I have to do is gonna miss a late miss

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.539 
I have to do is gonna miss a late miss
so<00:02:55.669> the<00:02:56.669> best<00:02:56.970> way<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.419> this<00:02:57.599> is<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.739> look<00:02:59.099> at

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
so the best way to do this is to look at

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.240 
so the best way to do this is to look at
the<00:02:59.700> number<00:03:00.030> underneath<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.769> unit<00:03:02.129> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the number underneath the unit that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.339 
the number underneath the unit that
you're<00:03:02.370> hitting<00:03:02.609> so<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.419> if<00:03:03.870> you're<00:03:04.049> hitting<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
you're hitting so if if you're hitting a

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.140 
you're hitting so if if you're hitting a
unit<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.099> said<00:03:05.310> something<00:03:05.939> that<00:03:06.030> has

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
unit with like I said something that has

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.339 
unit with like I said something that has
a<00:03:06.180> lot<00:03:06.419> more<00:03:06.480> defense<00:03:06.930> than<00:03:07.019> what<00:03:07.260> you're

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
a lot more defense than what you're

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.409 
a lot more defense than what you're
attacking<00:03:07.829> one<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.669> will<00:03:08.819> deal<00:03:09.000> damage<00:03:09.030> in

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
attacking one you will deal damage in

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.449 
attacking one you will deal damage in
increments<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.870> one<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.379> then<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:11.099> way<00:03:11.250> that

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
increments of one and then the way that

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.729 
increments of one and then the way that
you<00:03:11.579> can<00:03:11.790> see<00:03:12.180> how<00:03:12.780> much<00:03:12.930> you're<00:03:13.139> dealing<00:03:13.620> is

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
you can see how much you're dealing is

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.530 
you can see how much you're dealing is
if<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.040> look<00:03:14.219> underneath<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.939> character

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
if you look underneath the character

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.479 
if you look underneath the character
that<00:03:15.629> you're<00:03:15.750> hitting<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.530> will<00:03:16.680> indicate<00:03:17.129> how

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
that you're hitting it will indicate how

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.219 
that you're hitting it will indicate how
many<00:03:17.549> hits<00:03:17.849> you've<00:03:18.060> done<00:03:18.269> essentially<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.109> how

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
many hits you've done essentially so how

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.780 
many hits you've done essentially so how
much<00:03:19.349> damage<00:03:19.590> equal<00:03:19.949> number<00:03:20.129> of<00:03:20.190> hits<00:03:20.370> it's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
much damage equal number of hits it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.259 
much damage equal number of hits it's
only<00:03:20.909> one<00:03:21.209> at<00:03:21.449> a<00:03:21.750> time<00:03:22.109> so<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:23.129> this<00:03:23.400> case<00:03:23.729> when

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
only one at a time so in this case when

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.879 
only one at a time so in this case when
I<00:03:24.299> here<00:03:24.479> with<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.720> Penguins<00:03:25.229> you'll<00:03:25.409> see<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
I here with the Penguins you'll see that

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.129 
I here with the Penguins you'll see that
I<00:03:25.919> only<00:03:26.040> deal<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.849> increments<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.840> one<00:03:27.989> to

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
I only deal in increments of one to

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.679 
I only deal in increments of one to
these<00:03:28.260> enemies<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.419> essentially<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.659> way

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
these enemies and so essentially the way

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.659 
these enemies and so essentially the way
you<00:03:30.930> do<00:03:31.169> this<00:03:31.260> technique<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.919> as<00:03:32.099> soon<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.549> you

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
you do this technique is as soon as you

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.599 
you do this technique is as soon as you
see<00:03:32.939> that<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:34.680> you've<00:03:34.919> hit<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.310> number<00:03:35.549> of

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
see that that you've hit the number of

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.099 
see that that you've hit the number of
maximum<00:03:36.000> number<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.239> hits<00:03:36.449> in<00:03:36.629> this<00:03:36.720> case<00:03:36.930> it's

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
maximum number of hits in this case it's

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.319 
maximum number of hits in this case it's
a<00:03:37.199> penguin<00:03:37.439> so<00:03:37.799> as<00:03:38.250> soon<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.669> see<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.060> five

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
a penguin so as soon as I see the five

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.449 
a penguin so as soon as I see the five
show<00:03:39.750> up<00:03:39.870> under<00:03:40.229> the<00:03:40.349> enemy<00:03:40.680> that's<00:03:41.220> when<00:03:41.370> I

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
show up under the enemy that's when I

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.420 
show up under the enemy that's when I
will<00:03:41.519> press<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.419> next<00:03:42.629> character<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
will press the next character the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.159 
will press the next character the
important<00:03:44.819> thing<00:03:44.909> here<00:03:44.939> is<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.930> doesn't

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
important thing here is that it doesn't

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.210 
important thing here is that it doesn't
matter<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.590> said<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:46.829> magic<00:03:47.099> either

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
matter like I said this magic either

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.649 
matter like I said this magic either
perfect<00:03:47.519> sometimes<00:03:48.120> you'll<00:03:48.359> get<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.479> perfect

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
perfect sometimes you'll get a perfect

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.479 
perfect sometimes you'll get a perfect
with<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.109> sometimes<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.560> won't<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:50.250> doesn't

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
with this sometimes you won't it doesn't

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.460 
with this sometimes you won't it doesn't
matter<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:51.629> important<00:03:51.930> thing<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.169> that<00:03:52.319> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
matter the important thing is that you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.569 
matter the important thing is that you
move<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:52.919> to<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.069> next<00:03:53.340> character<00:03:53.540> without

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
move on to the next character without

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.189 
move on to the next character without
losing<00:03:56.579> any<00:03:56.729> combo<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:57.689> I<00:03:57.720> want<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.049> like

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
losing any combo what I want it like

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.780 
losing any combo what I want it like
what<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> used<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.949> do<00:03:59.069> was<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.400> would<00:03:59.609> try

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
what I used to do was that I would try

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.429 
what I used to do was that I would try
to<00:03:59.819> go<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.329> perfect<00:04:00.810> again<00:04:01.019> that's<00:04:01.259> how<00:04:01.319> I

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
to go for a perfect again that's how I

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.080 
to go for a perfect again that's how I
would<00:04:01.680> get<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:02.009> and<00:04:02.099> I<00:04:02.489> sometimes<00:04:02.669> would<00:04:02.909> get

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
would get it and I sometimes would get

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.999 
would get it and I sometimes would get
it<00:04:03.180> great<00:04:03.419> because<00:04:03.989> I'd<00:04:04.109> miss<00:04:04.409> most<00:04:04.889> but<00:04:04.979> you

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:05.009

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.530 
it great because I'd miss most but you
know<00:04:05.159> if<00:04:05.549> everyone<00:04:05.909> misses<00:04:06.090> from<00:04:06.239> time<00:04:06.449> to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
know if everyone misses from time to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.229 
know if everyone misses from time to
time<00:04:06.569> so<00:04:07.319> once<00:04:08.129> did<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.310> saw<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.729> then<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.060> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
then I'm going to the next character so

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.229 
then I'm going to the next character so
this<00:04:13.829> is<00:04:13.919> a<00:04:13.949> perfect<00:04:14.370> way<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:14.759> guys<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.180> I
