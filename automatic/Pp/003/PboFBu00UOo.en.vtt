possibilities and I'm sure that by now
you<00:01:33.450> fully<00:01:33.840> realize<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.320> potential<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you fully realize the potential of this

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is go to each of the top six tools show

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.109 
is go to each of the top six tools show
you<00:01:42.060> step-by-step<00:01:42.810> how<00:01:43.470> easy<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.909> use

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you step-by-step how easy it is to use

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
you step-by-step how easy it is to use
them<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> little<00:01:46.770> test<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.520> check

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
them and also do a little test to check

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
them and also do a little test to check
the<00:01:48.090> accuracy<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> results<00:01:48.869> given<00:01:49.740> by<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the accuracy of the results given by it

the accuracy of the results given by it
of<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.369> tools<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.350> design<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.070> least

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of these tools to do design it at least

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.840 
of these tools to do design it at least
two<00:01:54.000> example<00:01:54.509> phone<00:01:54.720> numbers<00:01:55.219> one<00:01:56.219> US<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> one

for<00:02:04.640> obvious<00:02:05.240> reasons<00:02:05.660> but<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.260> can<00:02:06.470> still<00:02:06.710> use

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
for obvious reasons but I can still use

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.490 
for obvious reasons but I can still use
a<00:02:06.890> number<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:08.660> kind<00:02:08.930> of<00:02:09.050> public

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
institution but that's not really a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.440 
institution but that's not really a
problem<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.730> way<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.210> prove

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
problem because this way I can prove

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.160 
problem because this way I can prove
that<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.900> results<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.440> good<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.050> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
that the results are good so this is the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
testing data I took this data and put it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.330 
testing data I took this data and put it
into<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.470> text<00:02:48.890> file<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:51.440> would<00:02:51.740> have<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.040> quick

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
into a text file so I would have a quick

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.180 
into a text file so I would have a quick
access<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.290> let's<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.410> go<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> first

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
access to it let's just go to the first

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.540 
access to it let's just go to the first
tool<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.560> maybe<00:02:57.560> before<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.190> just

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
tool and maybe before I do that just

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.800 
tool and maybe before I do that just
another<00:02:59.420> short<00:02:59.840> explanation<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.550> test<00:03:01.880> that

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
another short explanation the test that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.780 
another short explanation the test that
I'm<00:03:02.990> going<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.530> do<00:03:03.740> now<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.130> very<00:03:04.370> simple

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790

each of these tools input the phone
number<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.519> see<00:03:10.820> if<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.300> address<00:03:11.420> returned

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
number and see if the address returned

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.840 
number and see if the address returned
by<00:03:12.380> these<00:03:12.560> tools<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.250> right<00:03:13.430> one<00:03:13.640> as
