about<00:04:42.760> this<00:04:42.910> is<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.200> say<00:04:44.200> an<00:04:44.260> enemy<00:04:44.620> kills

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
about this is that say an enemy kills

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.610 
about this is that say an enemy kills
your<00:04:45.099> teammate<00:04:45.520> from<00:04:45.610> across<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:45.970> map<00:04:46.620> you

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
your teammate from across the map you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.770 
your teammate from across the map you
can<00:04:47.800> go<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.130> collect<00:04:48.280> your<00:04:48.640> teammates<00:04:49.510> dog

tag and the enemy won't get the kill for
it<00:04:52.510> which<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.870> thought<00:04:53.050> was<00:04:53.200> pretty<00:04:53.380> cool<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:54.010> it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
it which I thought was pretty cool so it

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.430 
it which I thought was pretty cool so it
looks<00:04:54.729> like<00:04:54.820> they're<00:04:55.060> kind<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.330> enforcing<00:04:56.020> um

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440
