00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello guys , what's up? 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
 2015 debut with the right foot guys 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 I bring you the newest picture of the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.740
 channel that is called in that galera table 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 I would be telling you all the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 my farm attacks and defenses are all 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 attack that is interesting and curious 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 who has used a legal strategy 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 and what has happened 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 curious is saying to you in the same 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.480
 form the defense is in compliance with 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.700
 defends those that I think are worth the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.100
 It's a pity to bring that picture to me. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.809
 bring so you can earn more 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 experience if as I go too 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 learning and gaining experience with 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 attacks I suffer cool guys you 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.870
 absorb the techniques and strategies that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.399
 your opponents use beauty then 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 People, I'm going to close here because of this attack. 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 because it was the end of this serious attack 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.160
 I had the brilliant idea to bring 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.010
 this new frame for the channel 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 The golden idea then was I was 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 naturally speaking it is not usually 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 But civilian and honest and guys 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.500
 when you hit this village here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.450
 that I could only licata today 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.020
 trophies here dodo served face that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.250
 though I fucking thought I hand cracked 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 that this guy looks at the amount of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 resources that have and looked first 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.409
 troops and I saw that they were very 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 strong but lacks scene this layout here 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 I had to 64 in 2005 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.140
 blows the mayor to occupy the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.520
 young people and not for the barbarians to judge me 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.090
 I much prefer the blow from the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.009
 level means crazy to stay 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 hallucinated for a debate quite by chance 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.020
 was with two giants to those who did not 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.520
 know 8 will earn a good period the farm 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.710
 using giant after I stayed 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.640
 very good cow and wander but only 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.340
 with those goblins types in hessen without 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.770
 order without archers sometimes makes 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.509
 four walls break facim galera and to 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 Whose cable to get gets a tip 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.369
 for those who ended up taking 68 or stalks and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.800
 8 for some time now and want a tip from 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.960
 Where to cook it you need elixir 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.120
 of gold to step the defense 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.150
 the camp and barracks to gold three 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.850
 guys have faces have native life giving 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.360
 bobeira direct with very much resource 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.240
 people and even black is screwed 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.980
 black also has is large quantities 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.290
 The more you focus on the league you go. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.530
 find more but number 3 has a face in a 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.150
 enough I'll do it my 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.970
 hit level 10 quietly 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.370
 I 've already scratched myself. 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.070
 archer and hit level two forming 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.740
 we do not protect to buy then 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.470
 he was the third gold is to tranquilão 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.600
 who does not know 8 do not despair 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.100
 So guys I was talking here and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.990
 I thought put 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.720
 with these troops here even having the king 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.430
 the queen at e3 spells at a glance that i 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 I did not use people, but in the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.160
 Hell, I'll explain why not me 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.840
 I am a little more in this case that was not 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.630
 because the people are dumb 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.120
 Okay, I watched happen to come here. 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.100
 do and although at first I found 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.650
 would not have been able to attack 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.360
 I noticed that ok x guy bug was 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.580
 being updated you can see why 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.310
 She has a kiyota playpen. 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.190
 and the car embargo was also 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.770
 the plan castle can 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.110
 without flag or is without tacin clan 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.260
 is is even assumed that the prudent in the attack 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.210
 today between direct in verifying if it had 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.130
 troops he could have troops right here 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.430
 not having the right clan flag 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.700
 and something else that encouraged me to attack 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.410
 was the fact that the DTS is always here 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.680
 sit here where you have several resources 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.690
 inside here is entering by this diagonal 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.300
 here these can see I would have to 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.550
 these two deposits and here 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.030
 In the end, these two would not be left out. 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.370
 that these three here is more will see that 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.080
 I can also lead to deposits 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.920
 Here then bora there guys I told 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.200
 damn it 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.260
 O before knocking down Selau, I 've already 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.720
 the walls break that side between him and 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.210
 with that the giant is in a row 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.310
 there and is already playing card - yes 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.680
 I wanted to make a ranch here soon to 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.020
 clean up on this front here for the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.270
 Hero does not go to the right side 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.110
 note the following there is a mortar here 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.419
 very well occupied 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.569
 The mortar here only one thing happened. 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.099
 very cool that the cards 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.719
 these batteries here 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.270
 while giant takes the attention of the 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:39.550
 monkey assaca they came here gave 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.669
 time they overthrow this 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.770
 camp and then went straight to 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.810
 mortars because he came here for the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.300
 castle but how nice they were not 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.599
 in another battle here has another mortar 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.050
 is this giant him who was the last of the 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:58.509
 Mohicans there was to taste the flight and bake 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.669
 faces necklace bes machinery while 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.189
 those who came from behind were there 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.779
 on that mortar then it was excellent 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.599
 and then my two spring breakers 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.639
 they have been able to help here and open 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.750
 passing to the goblins you can see that the 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.069
 hit guys 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.729
 how they go straight there this piolo 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:21.099
 I to TV he thinks that of the baré king 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.840
 to release the barbarians together so that 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.849
 they make a shield for queen you want 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.740
 and for the goblins too 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.039
 Look , the poor made the party win. 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.180
 up and down there the queen came 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:36.819
 here for this deposit here and while 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.060
 charter was going there and goblin activist was there 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.520
 focused there and then he turned to the queen 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.120
 Unfortunately I still do not have the cloak, right? 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.529
 love your level 2 until you can handle it 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.419
 can see that only the level of the event 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:53.190
 quite a blow of the beast 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.789
 only after the slow aiming of the 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.520
 cannon right 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.120
 They really win there. 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.930
 heroes 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.289
 then she goes and dies then was 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.909
 because I did not use a 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.729
 lightning although it is possible to have 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.520
 destroyed in a mortar with him, right? 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.759
 It's a pretty cool thing, so let me 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.009
 come back here guys I did not use the 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.259
 spell because of it here 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.169
 I top in my snack factory 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:26.199
 and at 7 o'clock today a 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:29.650
 war in my clan or I did the three 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:32.529
 bulbs are attacking in the 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.990
 war of any factory for the chat 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:38.129
 I will not be able to cast a spell for 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.399
 this war so I precavied physical 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:43.619
 comment and leave spells stored 

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:46.499
 there and in the war he was even more 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:48.419
 approach him and I will attack and I 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:54.589
 very lucky guy because I'm going to keep a 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:59.249
 standard attack dragons and look here O 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:06.689

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:10.169

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.830
 here very badly paid and bug lists 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.129
 on here 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.189
 the rest is not well the priest to the 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:18.389
 cards and the magicians 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:20.369
 so that will bring more difficulty 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.369
 who are going to be the beasts to the dragons 

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:26.429
 but not so much portel and are level 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:28.679
 11 on then it was so nice to order 

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:31.979
 3 did lightning that there is 

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:34.319
