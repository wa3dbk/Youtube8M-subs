00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.029

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.280

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.429

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.959

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.960
 david and thank you also for being here 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.460
 because when you lose it's difficult but 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.830
 is that today they have made a super match 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.010
 also yes well I tried it as 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.370
 it always does not happen that with rafa rafa rafa 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.890
 rafa is very good and good to congratulate you 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 because I have lost four times 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 but I lost with a big one that has 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 who has david 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.400
 this man because you have a lot and the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.350
 who has more 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.840
 Well, it does not have many good things 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.530
 I think it's thanks to your uncle that's left 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.530
 well it 's very good 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.530
 the great big part of how rafa is 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.210
 also good it does everything right in the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.270
 story track and it's very good and that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.130
 apart as a person as it improves a rafa 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.690
 Maybe it was the day you saw more 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.250
 close to defeat at least in some 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.920
 in the second set and also you 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.440
 endangered good more than some set in the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.730
 party because it has undoubtedly been the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.320
 most difficult match I had since 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.720
 the david earth season will begin 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.100
 It always takes you to the limit and the truth 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.950
 that the first set has been very lucky 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.680
 in some ball is stuck 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
 to a comedy with the cane that the line 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.100
 the truth that I was lucky there after 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.450
 obviously when you have four or 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.460
 five but where are the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.000
 you save all a luck factor always 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.150
 is there 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.560
 so today he is on my side 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.000
 thank you who I have to thank 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.410
 you're going to see that and then the second 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.479
 set also when he is here for the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.040
 match though he's more than he gave the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.350
 set ball is also very close 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.830
 again lest partly it has been a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.500
 little lottery has fallen from my side 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.240
 asserting but very happy is good 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.070
 clear that you are the best in the world in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.830
 beaten earth you are the second best 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.429
 from the world of the public because we have 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.299
