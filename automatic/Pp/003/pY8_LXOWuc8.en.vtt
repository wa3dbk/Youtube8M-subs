00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.500
 that did mention it when I did the green poland I remember there 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.009
 at the portuguese club, it seems that the back is already there 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.759
 Try to get the home market down well in advance 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:21.680
 and no 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.999
 this is no reason it is just 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.949
 a perfect match is twice as much, but he is also a child cnn 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.899
 none of that but how can yuma quickly become something 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.640
 the more and more population and the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.240
 85 p50 piece for all-day seat 19 bronze 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.539
 in seven games 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.870
 priest playing system week for tainio orchestra six feet 2 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.050
 the man has everything to be a success but money 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.520
 he the money pair of packers 25 85 is this and 550 prix fox but is you gonna watch that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.620
 that is what I am going to tell now and put them belonged rickenbacker namely 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.280
 namely 86 there are orphans at the second start 86 strength and endurance 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.430
 and the responses 93 cover positioning but it also a few calm 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 points that almost the neighborhood behind it is a very bad one 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.140
 it is smart is also not optimal but light music that attention and cash 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 84 sold out existing the 80 long shot 90 should power no says that if it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.930
 a short fitting that is packages a crack is not optimal we help 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.070
 how often used all that besides pistol whipped is the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.450
 thyroid ballot papers left foot people so much better than that 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.610
 even for two-thirds great already a plus 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 this man's strong point is just literally 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.409
 after all it's been an hour of walking and that sounds so clichÃ© they sacrifice for 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.490
 proactive 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.970
 it really is a bit of a dose the passenger has to tidy away 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.479
 and you are still needed for japan even now 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.770
 Mario never weak this strip as he did the small spaces they were 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.350
 not invited in the speed marks here much like a very busy one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.810
 mess is up to speed 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.859
 but the small space absolutely does not 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.729
 but that one badly did the alice running actions to tackle every ball deadly 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.790
 Again gun holes work and it's great 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.900
 this man is such a monker dominant 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.200
 that those defenders 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 traffic gets almost as fast as co-financing and then you know what is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.410
 the guy well the finger that is so peer ah well 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.029
 hold 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.769
 what first wants the world of hats from the Netherlands 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.069
 is unbelievable m i think best of them 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.049
 first turn are employability and from the evening valcke you do it again 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.269
 well i use it concerns the situation on the 4 2 and 2 second variant 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.299
 but I also see how he can work in bolt as a lone striker in the pike 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.589
 sadness third variant 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.319
 can work offline in, for example, a squeaky mortgage market 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.589
 I have that there are very many options to look at strong 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.589
 point because he can really do a lot of facebook is fast 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.829
 very strong and you notice that especially in the ears I say that it also works 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.089
 but that it is so low to continue to expand was denied by the 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.970
 porch full 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.260
 He had always dreamed of it but that there is still a contract to make it say 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.630
 but there is no show in the physical duels 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.000
 one by one well 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.549
 Dassen also offers sure to be strong 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.010
 for example, they see that ball and think that we are both out of position 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.589
 with his left that ball just goes in he is incredible here too 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:16.099
 once it's out of the plan, you won't notice much hidden 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.110
 follow us on twitter i already know who usually thinks the word 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.940
 and on yielded then still known as a kind of thing you really work enormously 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.600
 becomes this 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.190
 wonderfully just perfect book posted who that is just really great 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.820
 pointed ball dnb that comebacks because left leg lived most striking keeper 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.929
 and you see this man in several clubs 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.719
 the perfect match can play football, it is always in the right place 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.879
 runs together at the right time he makes every bar with left and right as well 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.199
 great headlines the only thing he can't dribble is the small space that is 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.829
 really something bad news 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:48.989
 I have to get better 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.400
 yes if i would do it i would know that it will come to a good end 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.249
 us to do 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.700
 if I have a so-called 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.230
 with the number then the sign from the back would be favored because that we 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.180
 break you notice there are not too many worse just years put use I gave very 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.730
 what places at the contractor running action or make the cigar real 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.700
 idealis man suspected by the tub alfred schaffer let me know 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.510
 labyad plays 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.760
 it seems to extinguish then here and there I am cigar later with new video 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.420
 keep waiting
