of a minor well the broken chord will

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:17.410 
of a minor well the broken chord will
sound<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.480> this

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.880 

that's<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.660> broken<00:01:18.960> cord<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.380> minor<00:01:19.620> but<00:01:19.860> I

that's your broken cord in a minor but I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's your broken cord in a minor but I
would<00:01:20.100> always<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:21.330> anyone<00:01:22.230> to<00:01:22.530> practice<00:01:23.160> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
would always get anyone to practice that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.080 
would always get anyone to practice that
broken<00:01:24.030> cord<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:25.230> block<00:01:25.680> chord<00:01:26.370> first<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
broken cord as a block chord first of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.220 
broken cord as a block chord first of
all<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> could<00:01:27.510> do<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.690> with<00:01:27.870> all<00:01:27.990> your

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
all you could do this with all your

all you could do this with all your
broken<00:01:28.380> cord<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.190> play<00:01:29.760> all<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.390> three

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
broken cord so you play all the three

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
broken cord so you play all the three
notes<00:01:30.990> together<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:33.260> then<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.470> find<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
notes together and then you find the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
notes together and then you find the
position<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.270> NICS<00:01:36.510> called<00:01:37.050> making<00:01:37.590> sure

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
position of the NICS called making sure

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
position of the NICS called making sure
that<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.190> have<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.520> correct<00:01:38.850> fingering<00:01:39.390> over

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that you have the correct fingering over

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
that you have the correct fingering over
the<00:01:39.900> notes<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> play<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.950> next

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the notes and then you play the next

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
the notes and then you play the next
chord<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> next<00:01:43.530> chord<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.870> so<00:01:45.870> on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
chord and then the next chord and so on

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.130 
chord and then the next chord and so on
until<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.980> top<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.990> then<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
until you get to the top and then you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.470 
until you get to the top and then you
come<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:52.430> now<00:01:53.430> once<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.030> play<00:01:54.240> all

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
come back down now once you can play all

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.900 
come back down now once you can play all
the<00:01:54.960> notes<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.470> same<00:01:55.710> time<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.730> then

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
the notes at the same time you can then

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.180 
the notes at the same time you can then
break<00:01:57.300> them<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:58.830> would<00:01:59.040> always

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
break them up now what I would always

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.050 
break them up now what I would always
suggest<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:02.190> sure<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.550> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
suggest you do is make sure that the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
suggest you do is make sure that the
wrist<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> flexible<00:02:04.140> than<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.290> fingers<00:02:04.860> are

wrist is flexible than the fingers are

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
wrist is flexible than the fingers are
nice<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.640> firm<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:07.050> if<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.320> wrist

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
nice and firm because if your wrist

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.740 
nice and firm because if your wrist
isn't<00:02:07.860> flexible<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.910> your<00:02:09.030> fingers<00:02:09.420> are<00:02:09.450> not

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.250 
isn't flexible and your fingers are not
curved<00:02:10.430> it's<00:02:11.430> impossible<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.780> all<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> notes

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
curved it's impossible for all the notes

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
curved it's impossible for all the notes
to<00:02:13.560> go<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> same<00:02:14.310> time<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:16.110> once<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
to go down at the same time now once you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.030 
to go down at the same time now once you
can<00:02:17.520> play<00:02:17.760> your<00:02:18.050> basic<00:02:19.050> broken<00:02:19.770> chord

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
can play your basic broken chord

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.340 
can play your basic broken chord
patterns<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:20.820> then<00:02:21.080> extend<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
patterns you can then extend the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.320 
patterns you can then extend the
exercise<00:02:23.070> into<00:02:23.370> something<00:02:23.880> that's<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.150> little

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
exercise into something that's a little

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.920 
exercise into something that's a little
more<00:02:24.600> complicated<00:02:25.010> if<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:27.090> take<00:02:27.330> F<00:02:27.570> major

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
more complicated if you take F major

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.500 
more complicated if you take F major
broken<00:02:28.620> chord<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.190> example<00:02:32.330> where<00:02:33.330> you're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
broken chord for example where you're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:48.910 
broken chord for example where you're
just<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.870 

the<00:02:49.819> tendency<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:51.170> try<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.610> stretch<00:02:52.610> over

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
the tendency is to try to stretch over

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.240 
the tendency is to try to stretch over
as<00:02:53.270> many<00:02:53.660> notes<00:02:53.900> as<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.319> can<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:54.830> often<00:02:54.980> see

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
as many notes as you can and I often see

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.370 
as many notes as you can and I often see
students<00:02:55.640> do<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.750> see<00:02:56.959> them<00:02:57.140> doing<00:02:57.260> it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
students do this and I see them doing it

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.559 
students do this and I see them doing it
in<00:02:57.530> arpeggios<00:02:58.069> as<00:02:58.250> well<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:59.030> example

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
in arpeggios as well so for example

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.690 
in arpeggios as well so for example
you've<00:02:59.930> got<00:02:59.959> your<00:03:00.290> basic<00:03:00.620> four<00:03:01.190> note<00:03:01.459> chord

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
you've got your basic four note chord

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.760 
you've got your basic four note chord
pattern<00:03:07.630> which<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:08.780> its<00:03:08.930> own<00:03:09.080> is<00:03:09.290> actually<00:03:09.590> a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
pattern which all its own is actually a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.590 
pattern which all its own is actually a
big<00:03:10.250> stretch<00:03:10.640> because<00:03:11.000> you've<00:03:11.150> got<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.450> two

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
big stretch because you've got the two

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.690 
big stretch because you've got the two
notes<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.930> between<00:03:11.990> so<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.950> increases<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
notes in between so it increases the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
notes in between so it increases the
stretch<00:03:13.970> between<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.660> thumb<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.650> fifth

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
stretch between the thumb and the fifth

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.940 
stretch between the thumb and the fifth
finger<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.940> always<00:03:17.390> advise<00:03:18.260> people<00:03:18.739> not

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
finger that I always advise people not

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.100 
finger that I always advise people not
to<00:03:19.160> prepare<00:03:19.730> more<00:03:19.940> than<00:03:20.090> two<00:03:20.300> notes<00:03:20.569> at<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.870> time

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
to prepare more than two notes at a time

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.110 
to prepare more than two notes at a time
so<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.739> case<00:03:22.150> here's<00:03:23.150> your<00:03:23.450> first<00:03:23.780> chord

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
so in this case here's your first chord

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.770 
so in this case here's your first chord
so<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.690> prepare<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> first<00:03:27.800> two<00:03:28.130> notes

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
so you just prepare the first two notes

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.470 
so you just prepare the first two notes
and<00:03:29.890> then<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:30.920> reach<00:03:31.280> for<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.700> other<00:03:31.820> two<00:03:32.120> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and then you reach for the other two and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.570 
and then you reach for the other two and
then<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.440> bring<00:03:33.680> your<00:03:33.739> thumb<00:03:34.100> up<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.459> that

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
then you bring your thumb up so that

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.630 
then you bring your thumb up so that
it's<00:03:34.730> ready<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.239> play<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:36.019> next<00:03:36.050> chord

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
it's ready to play the next chord

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.400 
it's ready to play the next chord
prepare<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.790> second<00:03:38.239> finger<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.200> reach

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
prepare the second finger and you reach

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.979 
prepare the second finger and you reach
up<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.070> fourth<00:03:40.340> finger<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.940> then<00:03:41.810> you

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
up to the fourth finger and then you

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.550 
up to the fourth finger and then you
prepare<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.980> thumb<00:03:43.400> for<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.820> next<00:03:44.560> second

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
prepare the thumb for the next second

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.990 
prepare the thumb for the next second
finger<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:47.890> then<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.010> bring<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.550> thumb<00:03:49.820> up

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
finger and then you bring the thumb up

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.229 
finger and then you bring the thumb up
to<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.540> first<00:03:50.930> note<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.590> next<00:03:51.950> chord

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
to the first note of the next chord

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.810 
to the first note of the next chord
prepare<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.420> second<00:03:53.870> finger<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.610> on

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
prepare the second finger and so on

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.170 
prepare the second finger and so on
always<00:03:56.390> with<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> good<00:03:57.650> firm<00:03:58.130> touch<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.910> a

always with a good firm touch and a
flexible<00:03:59.840> wrist<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.590> then<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:00.829> can<00:04:00.980> do<00:04:01.160> the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
flexible wrist and then you can do the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.180 
flexible wrist and then you can do the
same<00:04:01.519> exercises<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.600> left<00:04:02.840> hand<00:04:03.140> as<00:04:03.380> well

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
same exercises in the left hand as well

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.569 
same exercises in the left hand as well
and<00:04:04.880> once<00:04:05.180> you're<00:04:05.540> able<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.959> play<00:04:06.530> your<00:04:06.579> chords

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
and once you're able to play your chords

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.360 
and once you're able to play your chords
with<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.180> good<00:04:08.630> structure<00:04:09.530> which<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.160> what<00:04:10.340> I

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
with a good structure which is what I

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.610 
with a good structure which is what I
call<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:11.780> you're<00:04:11.870> as<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.049> say<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.350> know

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
call it so that you're as I say you know

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.949 
call it so that you're as I say you know
a<00:04:12.650> nice<00:04:12.860> rounded<00:04:13.459> hand<00:04:13.880> firm<00:04:14.360> fingers

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
a nice rounded hand firm fingers

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.710 
a nice rounded hand firm fingers
flexible<00:04:15.890> wrist<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.669> can<00:04:16.700> then<00:04:17.030> move<00:04:17.269> on<00:04:17.510> to

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
flexible wrist you can then move on to

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.620 
flexible wrist you can then move on to
more<00:04:17.870> difficult<00:04:18.130> chord<00:04:19.130> exercises<00:04:19.970> I've

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
more difficult chord exercises I've

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.690 
more difficult chord exercises I've
actually<00:04:20.870> written<00:04:21.290> out<00:04:21.590> another<00:04:22.070> exercise

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
actually written out another exercise

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.659 
actually written out another exercise
which<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.090> still<00:04:23.600> based<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.200> basic<00:04:24.860> chord<00:04:25.340> so

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
which is still based on basic chord so

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.010 
which is still based on basic chord so
in<00:04:25.760> this<00:04:25.880> case<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:27.110> C<00:04:27.560> major<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.729> can<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.840> can

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
in this case of C major you can you can

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.130 
in this case of C major you can you can
vary<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.470> any<00:04:30.650> which<00:04:30.950> way<00:04:30.979> you<00:04:31.250> like<00:04:31.700> and

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
vary it in any which way you like and

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.719 
vary it in any which way you like and
this<00:04:33.140> is<00:04:33.200> just<00:04:33.590> basically<00:04:33.979> going<00:04:34.280> up<00:04:34.520> the

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
this is just basically going up the

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.340 
this is just basically going up the
scale<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.300> three<00:04:36.169> note<00:04:36.410> triads<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.080> here's<00:04:39.080> my

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
scale in three note triads so here's my

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:56.890 
scale in three note triads so here's my
example<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:55.250> here<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.240> most<00:04:56.419> important

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
example and here the most important

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.350 
example and here the most important
thing<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.229> that<00:04:57.260> your<00:04:57.740> over<00:04:58.280> all<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.910> three

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
thing is that your over all the three

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.180 
thing is that your over all the three
notes<00:04:59.599> are<00:04:59.780> four<00:05:00.020> called<00:05:00.320> fingers<00:05:00.800> of<00:05:00.950> firm

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
notes are four called fingers of firm

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.350 
notes are four called fingers of firm
nice<00:05:01.430> rounded

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
nice rounded

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.929 
nice rounded
hand<00:05:02.810> position<00:05:03.680> trying<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.550> make<00:05:04.729> sure<00:05:04.759> that

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
hand position trying to make sure that

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.450 
hand position trying to make sure that
all<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.569> notes<00:05:05.780> go<00:05:06.020> down<00:05:06.259> exactly<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.189> same

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
all the notes go down exactly the same

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.029 
all the notes go down exactly the same
time<00:05:07.789> and<00:05:07.969> then<00:05:08.539> you<00:05:08.569> can<00:05:08.900> just<00:05:09.139> copy<00:05:09.469> the<00:05:09.680> same

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
time and then you can just copy the same
