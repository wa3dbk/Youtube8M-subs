one earth makes this bridge so smart and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.490 
one earth makes this bridge so smart and
that's<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> pretty<00:00:15.719> good<00:00:15.900> question

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
that's a pretty good question

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
that's a pretty good question
one<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.070> pet<00:00:17.310> hates<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.789> pop-up<00:00:18.240> bridges

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
one of my pet hates about pop-up bridges

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.029 
one of my pet hates about pop-up bridges
is<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.140> fact<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.470> always<00:00:19.830> leave

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
is the fact that they always leave

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
is the fact that they always leave
flowing<00:00:20.490> water<00:00:20.699> streams<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> middle<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
flowing water streams in the middle of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.910 
flowing water streams in the middle of
your<00:00:21.600> lakes<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.320> don't<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.830> looks

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
your lakes and I don't think that looks

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
your lakes and I don't think that looks
particularly<00:00:23.340> good<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> thought<00:00:24.390> I'd

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
particularly good so what I thought I'd

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.490 
particularly good so what I thought I'd
do<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.689> come<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> design<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
do is come up with the design that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.170 
do is come up with the design that
doesn't<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> come

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
doesn't do that and this is what I come

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.029 
doesn't do that and this is what I come
up<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.349> clip<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.710> want<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
ground this is a two-block deep leg but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.360 
ground this is a two-block deep leg but

have a fantastic time then once we're
done<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.180> run<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
way back flick the lever once again and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
way back flick the lever once again and
as<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> bridge<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.019> retracted

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
as you can see the bridge is retracted

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
as you can see the bridge is retracted
back<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> ground<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
back down to the ground and all of the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.960 
back down to the ground and all of the
water<00:01:06.570> returns<00:01:07.409> back<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> normal<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.880> we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
water returns back to normal so if we

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.429 
water returns back to normal so if we
just<00:01:09.150> hop<00:01:09.299> off<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> edge<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> see

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
just hop off the edge here you can see

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.690 
just hop off the edge here you can see
all<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> Redstone<00:01:11.159> behind<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.490> thing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
all of the Redstone behind this thing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
all of the Redstone behind this thing
and<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.360> those<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.720> who<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.960> fairly<00:01:13.200> new

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and so those of you who have fairly new

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
and so those of you who have fairly new
to<00:01:13.590> redstone<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.130> may<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.310> sat<00:01:14.520> there

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to redstone you may be sat there

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
to redstone you may be sat there
thinking<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.240> looks<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.049> very

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
thinking that looks really very

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
thinking that looks really very
complicated<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.250> promise<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
complicated but I can promise you this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
complicated but I can promise you this
is<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.229> simple<00:01:19.530> indeed<00:01:19.979> this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
is actually all very simple indeed this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.249 
is actually all very simple indeed this
blue<00:01:20.939> circuit<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> slime<00:01:22.140> block

nice and easy and this orange circuit
here<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> timing<00:01:26.939> circuit<00:01:27.180> which

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
here is just a timing circuit which

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.690 
here is just a timing circuit which
allows<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> water<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.070> flow<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
allows all of the water to flow back to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
allows all of the water to flow back to
its<00:01:29.820> original<00:01:29.909> state<00:01:30.270> without<00:01:30.869> leaving<00:01:31.350> any

its original state without leaving any
water<00:01:31.799> streams<00:01:32.159> because<00:01:32.340> everyone<00:01:32.610> knows

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
water streams because everyone knows

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.100 
water streams because everyone knows
they're<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.450> ugly<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
they're really very ugly so I can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.600 
they're really very ugly so I can
promise<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.920> everyone<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.520> able

tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to<00:01:51.000> build<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.420> module<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to build one module because all of the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
to build one module because all of the
modules<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.040> same<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.640> Redstone<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
modules are the same the Redstone is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.460 
modules are the same the Redstone is
identical<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> basically

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
identical you just have to basically

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
identical you just have to basically
copy<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> paste<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> over<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.759> over<00:01:56.820> again<00:01:57.000> so

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
copy and paste it over and over again so

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.969 
copy and paste it over and over again so
for<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.899> module<00:01:58.290> you're<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> need<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
for this module you're going to need to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.560 
for this module you're going to need to
start<00:01:59.189> things<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.790> three<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.240> six

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
start things off with a three by six

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.700 
start things off with a three by six
area<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> first<00:02:01.290> thing<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> we're

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
area and the first thing that we're

area and the first thing that we're
going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:01.979> doing<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> be

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
going to be doing is we are going to be

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.630 
going to be doing is we are going to be
tucking<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.960> our<00:02:04.140> piston<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.799> first<00:02:05.040> off<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
tucking in our piston so first off you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
tucking in our piston so first off you
want<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:05.939> blocks<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.719> place

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
want to go two blocks up like this place

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
want to go two blocks up like this place

repeater running straight into that
block<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.860> side<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.310> block<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
block then on the side of this block you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.729 
block then on the side of this block you
want<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> place<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.270> redstone<00:02:39.630> torch<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.230> block

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
want to place a redstone torch a block

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.770 
want to place a redstone torch a block
on<00:02:40.950> top<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.310> torch<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:42.300> another

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
on top of that torch and then another

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.870 
on top of that torch and then another
redstone<00:02:43.050> torch<00:02:43.470> there<00:02:43.739> which<00:02:44.100> will<00:02:44.340> push<00:02:44.610> all

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
redstone torch there which will push all

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.400 
redstone torch there which will push all
of<00:02:44.910> these<00:02:45.120> blocks<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.750> wouldn't<00:02:46.260> worry

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
of these blocks up I wouldn't worry

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.650 
of these blocks up I wouldn't worry
about<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.800> one<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.160> yet<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:48.000> over<00:02:48.450> by<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
about that one just yet then over by the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.479 
about that one just yet then over by the
side<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.530> redstone<00:02:49.860> torch<00:02:50.190> here<00:02:50.250> you

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
side of this redstone torch here you

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.590 
side of this redstone torch here you
just<00:02:50.610> want<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.760> place<00:02:50.910> two<00:02:51.150> blocks<00:02:51.300> going

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
just want to place two blocks going

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.449 
just want to place two blocks going
across<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.170> repeaters<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.100> both<00:02:53.280> of

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
across like this repeaters up both of

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.310 
across like this repeaters up both of
them<00:02:53.640> set<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.910> full<00:02:54.330> ticks<00:02:54.630> running<00:02:55.019> into<00:02:55.290> a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
them set to full ticks running into a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.500 
them set to full ticks running into a
block<00:02:55.709> up<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.340> redstone<00:02:57.060> torch<00:02:57.180> on

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
block up like this a redstone torch on

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.479 
block up like this a redstone torch on
the<00:02:57.570> side<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.019> block<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.440> then<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.190> block

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the side of that block and then a block

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.340 
the side of that block and then a block
on<00:02:59.700> top<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.269> which<00:03:00.840> will<00:03:01.080> eventually

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
on top of that one which will eventually

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.229 
on top of that one which will eventually
have<00:03:01.950> your<00:03:02.130> piston<00:03:02.550> next<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.060> now<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
have your piston next to it so now you

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.940 
have your piston next to it so now you
want<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> take<00:03:03.630> out<00:03:03.750> all<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.380> stuff<00:03:04.650> here

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
want to take out all of this stuff here

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.250 
want to take out all of this stuff here
they<00:03:05.430> say<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> sticky<00:03:05.940> piston<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.959> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
they say a sticky piston like that a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.960 
they say a sticky piston like that a
slime<00:03:07.980> block<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.610> across<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> middle

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
slime block of going across the middle

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.000 
slime block of going across the middle
like<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.050> two<00:03:10.290> blocks<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.769> either

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
like that and then two blocks on either

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.670 
like that and then two blocks on either
side<00:03:11.310> just<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:12.170> final<00:03:13.170> bits<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.440> do<00:03:13.530> now

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
side just like that final bits to do now

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.290 
side just like that final bits to do now
you<00:03:13.739> just<00:03:13.950> want<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.160> place<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.519> block<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:15.030> next

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
you just want to place a block at next

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.000 
you just want to place a block at next
to<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.720> repeater<00:03:16.080> right<00:03:16.320> here<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.680> then

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
to this repeater right here and then

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.770 
to this repeater right here and then
shut<00:03:17.220> down<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> lever<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.790> as<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.180> see<00:03:18.390> we

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
shut down a lever and as you can see we

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
shut down a lever and as you can see we
got<00:03:18.930> ourselves<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.410> double<00:03:19.680> extension<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
got ourselves a double extension and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.640 
got ourselves a double extension and
also<00:03:21.150> at<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.420> double<00:03:21.780> retraction<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.500> now

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
also at the double retraction so now

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.500 
also at the double retraction so now
what<00:03:22.829> we<00:03:22.950> have<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.130> do<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.489> place<00:03:23.940> blocks<00:03:24.239> in

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
what we have to do is place blocks in

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.120 
what we have to do is place blocks in
like<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.840> or<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.140> either<00:03:25.350> side<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.010> keep

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
like this or on either side just to keep

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.380 
like this or on either side just to keep
everything<00:03:26.400> watertight<00:03:26.940> because<00:03:27.209> otherwise

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
everything watertight because otherwise

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.060 
everything watertight because otherwise
you'll<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.049> water<00:03:28.380> flowing<00:03:28.769> into<00:03:28.890> your

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
you'll have water flowing into your

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.699 
you'll have water flowing into your
redstone<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.540> always<00:03:30.840> bad<00:03:31.200> news<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
redstone and that is always bad news and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.350 
redstone and that is always bad news and
then<00:03:32.160> as<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.519> see<00:03:32.579> when<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.940> extends

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
then as you can see when it extends

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.940 
then as you can see when it extends
there<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.660> nowhere<00:03:34.019> for<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.590> water<00:03:34.709> to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
there is nowhere for all of the water to

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.710 
there is nowhere for all of the water to
go<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:36.090> you've<00:03:36.209> got<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.540> is

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
go so now what you've got to do is

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.960 
go so now what you've got to do is
you've<00:03:37.049> got<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.410> copy<00:03:37.650> all<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.370> build

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
you've got to copy all of this and build

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.940 
you've got to copy all of this and build
them<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.269> right<00:03:39.510> next<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.959> each<00:03:40.049> other<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.739> I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
them up right next to each other like I

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.160 
them up right next to each other like I
have<00:03:41.040> done<00:03:41.190> over<00:03:41.459> here<00:03:41.870> now<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.019> you've

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
have done over here now that you've

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.199 
have done over here now that you've
built<00:03:43.350> all<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.680> your<00:03:43.890> modules<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.640> also<00:03:45.000> I've

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
built all of your modules and also I've

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.670 
built all of your modules and also I've
added<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.690> all<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.019> water<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.530> can<00:03:46.560> see

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
added in all of the water you can see

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.170 
added in all of the water you can see
this<00:03:47.010> flowing<00:03:47.340> streams<00:03:47.790> there<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.090> we're

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
this flowing streams there and we're

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.400 
this flowing streams there and we're
going<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.329> be<00:03:48.420> sorting<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.140> couple

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
going to be sorting that out in a couple

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.990 
going to be sorting that out in a couple
seconds<00:03:49.799> what<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.579> do<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:50.880> want

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
seconds what you want to do is you want

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.819 
seconds what you want to do is you want
to<00:03:51.060> head<00:03:51.180> down<00:03:51.209> here<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.780> place<00:03:52.380> two<00:03:52.680> blocks

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
to head down here and place two blocks

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.860 
to head down here and place two blocks
in<00:03:53.100> between<00:03:53.250> all<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:53.910> these<00:03:54.090> blocks<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:54.600> all

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
in between all of these blocks it's all

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.660 
in between all of these blocks it's all
the<00:03:54.989> way<00:03:55.079> across<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.530> then<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.459> from

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the way across like that then up from

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.880 
the way across like that then up from
the<00:03:56.790> side<00:03:57.030> with<00:03:57.390> your<00:03:57.540> input<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.739> want

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
the side with your input you just want

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.770 
the side with your input you just want
to<00:03:58.920> chuck<00:03:59.190> some<00:03:59.220> repeaters<00:03:59.790> down<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.360> we're

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
to chuck some repeaters down and we're

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.390 
to chuck some repeaters down and we're
going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.019> be<00:04:01.140> setting<00:04:01.440> all<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.829> these<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.250> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
going to be setting all of these up to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.860 
going to be setting all of these up to
four<00:04:02.670> ticks<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.180> means<00:04:03.390> there<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.630> to

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
four ticks that means there is going to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.420 
four ticks that means there is going to
be<00:04:03.959> eight<00:04:04.140> ticks<00:04:04.470> between<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.250> these

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
be eight ticks between all of these

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.039 
be eight ticks between all of these
systems<00:04:05.850> which<00:04:06.329> will<00:04:06.480> give<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.750> enough<00:04:07.019> time

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
systems which will give it enough time

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.039 
systems which will give it enough time
to<00:04:07.920> replenish<00:04:08.220> all<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.060> water<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:09.810> go

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
to replenish all of the water to just go

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.840 
to replenish all of the water to just go
right<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.350> way<00:04:10.440> across<00:04:10.709> like<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.700> that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
you give the lever a flick you can see

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.660 
you give the lever a flick you can see
that<00:04:42.870> our<00:04:42.960> entire<00:04:43.290> bridge<00:04:43.590> extends<00:04:44.190> no<00:04:44.400> water

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
that our entire bridge extends no water

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.580 
that our entire bridge extends no water
is<00:04:44.850> flowing<00:04:45.210> into<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.480> redstone<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.050> we<00:04:46.500> have

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
is flowing into the redstone and we have

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.800 
is flowing into the redstone and we have
got<00:04:46.770> ourselves<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:47.340> good<00:04:47.520> walking<00:04:47.730> area<00:04:48.120> but<00:04:48.630> if

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
got ourselves a good walking area but if

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.420 
got ourselves a good walking area but if
we<00:04:48.930> give<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.170> lever<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.440> flick<00:04:49.680> once<00:04:49.860> more<00:04:50.100> you

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
we give the lever a flick once more you

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.650 
we give the lever a flick once more you
can<00:04:50.580> see<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.000> all<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> blocks<00:04:51.540> are

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
can see that all of the blocks are

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.450 
can see that all of the blocks are
tracked<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.170> we<00:04:52.410> end<00:04:52.530> up<00:04:52.680> with<00:04:52.890> a<00:04:53.040> completely

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460

tracked and we end up with a completely
flat<00:04:53.730> lake<00:04:54.120> which<00:04:54.480> looks<00:04:54.720> absolutely
