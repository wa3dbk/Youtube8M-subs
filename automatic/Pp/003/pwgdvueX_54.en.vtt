00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
the climate control in this car has lost

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.800 
the climate control in this car has lost
its<00:00:04.500> ability<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:05.069> maintain<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.089> cold

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
its ability to maintain a cold

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.490 
its ability to maintain a cold
temperature<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> cabin<00:00:08.870> so<00:00:09.870> remedy<00:00:10.320> this

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
temperature in the cabin so remedy this

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.780 
temperature in the cabin so remedy this
I<00:00:10.800> will<00:00:11.040> be<00:00:11.190> refilling<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.719> air<00:00:12.840> conditioning

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
I will be refilling the air conditioning

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.779 
I will be refilling the air conditioning
with<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.969> art<00:00:15.269> 1/3<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.440> aircon<00:00:17.310> gas<00:00:17.670> refill

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
with an art 1/3 for a aircon gas refill

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.400 
with an art 1/3 for a aircon gas refill
and<00:00:20.789> using<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> dispenser<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.260> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and using a dispenser with it to get it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
and using a dispenser with it to get it
into<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.740> system<00:00:27.230> first<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.740> need<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> run<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
into the system first we need to run the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.350 
into the system first we need to run the
car<00:00:30.240> engine

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.270 

this<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:36.600> also<00:00:36.960> let<00:00:37.140> us<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.500> what

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this will also let us see what

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
this will also let us see what
temperature<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.539> can<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
temperature we can get the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.259 
temperature we can get the
air-conditioning<00:00:40.739> down<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> moment

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.600 

so<00:00:48.269> I<00:00:48.300> set<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.839> minimum

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.370 

I'm<00:00:52.060> gonna<00:00:52.240> need<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.570> eat<00:00:52.690> this<00:00:52.810> run<00:00:53.020> in<00:00:53.170> for

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
I'm gonna need to eat this run in for

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.479 
I'm gonna need to eat this run in for
about<00:00:53.700> three<00:00:54.700> minutes

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.520 

during<00:01:00.489> this<00:01:00.610> time<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.540> can<00:01:01.690> also<00:01:01.870> check<00:01:02.320> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
during this time you can also check to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.539 
during this time you can also check to
see<00:01:02.770> if<00:01:03.100> there<00:01:03.340> are<00:01:03.370> any<00:01:03.489> leaks<00:01:03.970> in<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.300> system

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
see if there are any leaks in the system

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.060 
see if there are any leaks in the system
if<00:01:06.820> there<00:01:07.090> are<00:01:07.270> any<00:01:07.630> leaks<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.679> you<00:01:08.829> don't

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
if there are any leaks and you don't

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.679 
if there are any leaks and you don't
repay<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:09.579> you'll<00:01:09.880> need<00:01:09.969> to<00:01:10.030> get<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.390> repaired

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
repay it you'll need to get it repaired

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:25.950 
repay it you'll need to get it repaired
first

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.290 

even<00:01:26.740> after<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> few<00:01:27.160> minutes<00:01:27.520> with<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.970> engine

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
even after a few minutes with the engine

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.530 
even after a few minutes with the engine
running

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 

the<00:01:31.050> inside<00:01:31.590> temperature<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.160> not<00:01:32.340> drop

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the inside temperature is not drop

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.050 
the inside temperature is not drop
significantly<00:01:32.910> like<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.810> sure<00:01:34.020> enough<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.910> we

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
significantly like it sure enough so we

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.750 
significantly like it sure enough so we
will<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.360> refilling<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> system

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
will be refilling the system

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.600 
will be refilling the system
first<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.720> okay<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.470> low-side<00:01:40.890> ports<00:01:41.430> on

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
first of all okay the low-side ports on

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
first of all okay the low-side ports on
your<00:01:41.730> air<00:01:41.820> conditioning<00:01:42.330> pipes<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.560> remove

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

and<00:02:08.890> then<00:02:09.070> set<00:02:09.370> the<00:02:09.550> dial<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.380> temperature

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
and then set the dial to the temperature

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.190 
and then set the dial to the temperature
and<00:02:12.760> then<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:12.970> want<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.300> refill<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.960> within<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
and then we want to refill to within the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.920 
and then we want to refill to within the
green<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.740> within<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:16.500> temperature<00:02:17.500> lines

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
green but within the temperature lines

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.790 
green but within the temperature lines
use<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.960> quick<00:02:20.350> release

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.030 

pick<00:02:26.370> pick<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.030> onto<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.890> concierge<00:02:28.890> in

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
pick pick that onto the concierge in

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.449 
pick pick that onto the concierge in
this<00:02:29.220> dead

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.339 

now<00:02:32.000> we're<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.420> white<00:02:32.599> zone<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.230> need

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
now we're in the white zone so we need

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.589 
now we're in the white zone so we need
to<00:02:33.439> put<00:02:33.590> some<00:02:33.829> in<00:02:34.159> so<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:34.819> squeeze<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.120> trigger

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.819 

give<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.719> a<00:02:39.749> shake<00:02:39.959> every<00:02:40.230> few<00:02:40.409> seconds

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
give it a shake every few seconds

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.379 
give it a shake every few seconds
release<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.249> trigger<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.760> check<00:02:42.120> where<00:02:42.299> you

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
release the trigger to check where you

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.890 
release the trigger to check where you
are<00:02:42.739> bit<00:02:43.739> more<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:45.209> we're<00:02:45.389> in<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.689> green

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
are bit more and we're in the green

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.390 
are bit more and we're in the green
that's<00:02:46.379> fine<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:47.519> was<00:02:47.670> easy

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
that's fine that was easy

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.309 
that's fine that was easy
release<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
release that

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.750 
release that
and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.739> leave<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> car<00:02:53.220> running<00:02:53.250> but

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and then we leave the car running but

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.479 
and then we leave the car running but
we'll<00:02:53.909> put<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> cap<00:02:54.360> back<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:56.099> we'll<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.400> if

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
we'll put the cap back and we'll see if

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.660 
we'll put the cap back and we'll see if
that<00:02:56.519> kills<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.090> car<00:02:57.299> down<00:02:57.540> any<00:02:57.720> further

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
that kills the car down any further

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.370 
that kills the car down any further
hopefully<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.790> should

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.950 

only<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.100> few<00:03:04.340> seconds<00:03:04.850> later<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.390> back<00:03:05.570> inside

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
only a few seconds later and back inside

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.700 
only a few seconds later and back inside
the<00:03:06.170> car<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:08.480> temperature<00:03:09.080> drop<00:03:09.320> has<00:03:09.530> been

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
the car the temperature drop has been

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.890 
the car the temperature drop has been
immediate
