00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
and one video the shirt in one video you
know<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> head<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:37.170> kind<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> chuck<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> up

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
know the head just kind of chuck it up

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560
