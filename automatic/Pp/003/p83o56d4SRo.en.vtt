mentioned<00:00:32.910> quite<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> lot<00:00:33.540> which<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> why<00:00:34.860> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
mentioned quite a lot which is why we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.709 
mentioned quite a lot which is why we
have<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> particular<00:00:35.610> interest<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> value

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

why<00:00:38.309> we're<00:00:38.489> bringing<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.149> today<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
why we're bringing it to you today of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
why we're bringing it to you today of
course<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> sound<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> because

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
course the sound is off on this because

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
course the sound is off on this because
it<00:00:41.579> makes<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> easier<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> hear<00:00:42.420> me<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:43.500> with

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it makes it easier to hear me here with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.810 
it makes it easier to hear me here with
all<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> information<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> front<00:00:44.700> end

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
all that information on the front end

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.100 
all that information on the front end
let's<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.300> ahead<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.510> jump<00:00:45.899> straight

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
let's just go ahead and jump straight

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
let's just go ahead and jump straight
into<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> game<00:00:46.860> itself<00:00:47.300> obviously<00:00:48.300> i've

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
into the game itself obviously i've

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.850 
into the game itself obviously i've
already<00:00:48.690> gone<00:00:48.870> through<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.140> tutorial<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
already gone through the tutorial so it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
already gone through the tutorial so it
is<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.399> jump<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.329> have

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
is going to just jump in and then have

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
is going to just jump in and then have
me<00:00:51.600> play<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> game<00:00:52.140> essentially<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> concept

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
me play the game essentially the concept

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
me play the game essentially the concept
looks<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> row<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> fish

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
looks like this you have a row of fish

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
looks like this you have a row of fish
which<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.129> less<00:00:56.190> instructions<00:00:56.940> as

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
which are more or less instructions as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
which are more or less instructions as
far<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.960> fish<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.289> need<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> tap<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
far as what fish you need to tap the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.430 
far as what fish you need to tap the
second<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.399> appear<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.289> obviously

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
second they appear and then obviously

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.740 
second they appear and then obviously
doing<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> points<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.180> simple

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
doing so or as you points it's simple

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.399 
doing so or as you points it's simple
it's<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.350> effective<00:01:05.390> as<00:01:06.390> far<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.869> being

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it's very effective as far as being

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.719 
it's very effective as far as being
easily<00:01:07.619> lauren<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.400> takes<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> few

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
easily lauren it only takes a few

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.490 
easily lauren it only takes a few
seconds<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> hold<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.080> fact<00:01:10.320> maybe

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
seconds to get a hold of in fact maybe

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.190 
seconds to get a hold of in fact maybe
even<00:01:10.799> less<00:01:11.390> once<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> understand<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> basic

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
even less once you understand the basic

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.300 
even less once you understand the basic
concept<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> course<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
concept which of course there is a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
concept which of course there is a
tutorial<00:01:14.549> involved<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> show<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
tutorial involved to show you how but it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
tutorial involved to show you how but it
is<00:01:16.920> quite<00:01:17.130> challenging<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is quite challenging to do in a way that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
is quite challenging to do in a way that
earns<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> higher<00:01:19.890> score<00:01:20.130> than<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.490> have

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
earns you a higher score than you have

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.179 
earns you a higher score than you have
previously<00:01:21.210> earned<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.500> instance<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
previously earned for instance you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
previously earned for instance you
getting<00:01:23.520> combos<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.180> obviously<00:01:24.360> that's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
getting combos here obviously that's
