your black material and want to go down
to<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> selection<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.609> type<00:01:53.759> r

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
to the selection and you want to type r

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.279 
to the selection and you want to type r
1<00:01:55.219> capital<00:01:56.219> R<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> apply<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
1 capital R it's going to apply the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.910 
1 capital R it's going to apply the
material<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> caps<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> object<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.889> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
material to the caps of the object so I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.419 
material to the caps of the object so I
think<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.369> looks<00:02:02.729> decent<00:02:03.979> let's<00:02:04.979> rotate

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
think that looks decent let's rotate

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.220 
think that looks decent let's rotate
around<00:02:05.850> this

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
around this

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.010 
around this
okay<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.940> let's<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:09.840> here<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.290> grab<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.010> camera

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
okay so let's go here and grab a camera

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.440 
okay so let's go here and grab a camera
all<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.100> while<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.790> zoom<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
all right so while if we zoom out here a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.080 
all right so while if we zoom out here a
bit<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.170> orbit<00:02:16.830> around<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:17.940> that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
bit and orbit around you can see that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.350 
bit and orbit around you can see that
will<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> camera<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.080> our<00:02:19.230> senior<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.360> but

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
will have a camera in our senior and but

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.100 
will have a camera in our senior and but
wanna<00:02:21.660> go<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.830> cameras<00:02:23.580> perspective<00:02:24.110> so

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
wanna go into the cameras perspective so

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.740 
wanna go into the cameras perspective so
you<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> click<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.730> black<00:02:27.360> box

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
magically transform into a camera and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.160 
magically transform into a camera and
you<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:35.550> whatever<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.630> camera<00:02:37.050> is

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you can see whatever the camera is

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
tags and grab a vibrate tag okay so if

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.620 
tags and grab a vibrate tag okay so if
we<00:02:59.100> play<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.460> animation<00:02:59.550> now<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.510> know

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
we play the animation now you know

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.200 
we play the animation now you know
nothing<00:03:01.020> will<00:03:01.170> happen<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.920> let's<00:03:02.520> enable<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
nothing will happen so let's enable the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.700 
nothing will happen so let's enable the
position<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:05.330> yeah<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.510> gonna<00:03:06.720> create<00:03:07.440> some

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
position and yeah it's gonna create some

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.570 
position and yeah it's gonna create some
random<00:03:08.340> camera<00:03:09.300> movement<00:03:09.720> there<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:11.430> that's

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
random camera movement there but that's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.370 
random camera movement there but that's
not<00:03:11.850> looking<00:03:12.120> too<00:03:12.420> good<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.050> we're<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.290> to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
not looking too good so we're going to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.040 
not looking too good so we're going to
change<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.920> values<00:03:14.550> here<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> bit<00:03:15.060> so

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
change up the values here a bit so

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.010 
change up the values here a bit so
instead<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.410> 100<00:03:17.000> we<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.150> type<00:03:18.360> thirty<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
instead of 100 we can type thirty and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.820 
instead of 100 we can type thirty and
then<00:03:19.680> 30<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.310> other<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.470> now<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:22.530> come<00:03:22.800> to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
then 30 on the other and now we come to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.600 
then 30 on the other and now we come to
the<00:03:22.980> c-axis<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:24.150> if<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:25.140> put<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.800> large<00:03:26.160> number

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
the c-axis and if we put a large number

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.960 
the c-axis and if we put a large number
here<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.470> 500<00:03:28.580> you're<00:03:29.580> going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> see<00:03:29.940> what

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
here like 500 you're going to see what

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.920 
here like 500 you're going to see what
happens<00:03:30.739> it's<00:03:31.739> going<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.920> zoom<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.360> it's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
happens it's going to zoom out and it's

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.380 
happens it's going to zoom out and it's
going<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.140> look<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.320> weird<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.180> don't

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
going to look really weird so I don't

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.729 
going to look really weird so I don't
like<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.570> sometimes<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.350> that's<00:03:37.530> just

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
like that sometimes that that's just

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.400 
like that sometimes that that's just
five<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.400> can<00:03:38.580> set<00:03:38.790> its<00:03:38.940> ear<00:03:39.239> if<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.510> want<00:03:39.750> but

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
five you can set its ear if you want but

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.930 
five you can set its ear if you want but
I<00:03:40.470> want<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:41.550> know<00:03:41.700> just<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.150> little<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:43.770> know

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
I want you know just a little you know

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.990 
I want you know just a little you know
random<00:03:44.940> movement<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.720> z<00:03:45.989> axis<00:03:46.020> as<00:03:46.590> well

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
random movement on the z axis as well

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.330 
random movement on the z axis as well
okay<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.510> um<00:03:49.190> let's<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.580> how<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.090> looks

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
okay so um let's see how this looks

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.600 
okay so um let's see how this looks
looking<00:03:53.340> pretty<00:03:53.370> good<00:03:53.910> pretty<00:03:54.150> smooth<00:03:54.660> so<00:03:55.140> far

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
looking pretty good pretty smooth so far

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.910 
looking pretty good pretty smooth so far
you<00:03:56.610> can<00:03:56.820> increase<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.959> amplitude<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.890> the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
you can increase the amplitude and the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.270 
you can increase the amplitude and the
frequency<00:04:00.080> if<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.290> want<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.770> a<00:04:01.800> bit<00:04:02.100> more

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
frequency if you want to be a bit more

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.229 
frequency if you want to be a bit more
intense<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.900> five<00:04:04.320> or<00:04:04.590> something<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:06.150> if

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
intense to like five or something but if

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.840 
intense to like five or something but if
you<00:04:06.360> want<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.690> be<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:07.140> more<00:04:07.290> smooth<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.700> can

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
you want to be a bit more smooth you can

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.530 
you want to be a bit more smooth you can
just<00:04:09.060> set<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.750> like<00:04:10.489> 0.5

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
just set it to like 0.5

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.630 
just set it to like 0.5
but<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.379> hope<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.799> learned<00:04:14.040> something<00:04:14.310> from
