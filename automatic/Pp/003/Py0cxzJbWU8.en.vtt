00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
it kind of nice because that provides

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.880 
it kind of nice because that provides
habitat<00:01:06.050> for<00:01:06.080> some<00:01:06.350> of<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.500> endangered

habitat for some of the endangered

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.469 
habitat for some of the endangered
species<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.460> there<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.789> other<00:01:07.820> wander<00:01:08.210> harder

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
species up there the other wander harder

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.419 
species up there the other wander harder
and<00:01:08.750> harder<00:01:09.259> Cherokee<00:01:09.710> target<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:10.250> like

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
and harder Cherokee target they like

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.249 
and harder Cherokee target they like
those<00:01:10.610> little<00:01:10.880> riffles<00:01:11.240> behind<00:01:11.630> those<00:01:11.840> trees

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
those little riffles behind those trees

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.719 
those little riffles behind those trees
but<00:01:12.590> makes<00:01:13.009> it<00:01:13.130> kind<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.310> difficult<00:01:13.429> for

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
but makes it kind of difficult for

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.960 
but makes it kind of difficult for
Catholics<00:01:14.539> especially<00:01:15.009> paddlers<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.310> don't

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
Catholics especially paddlers that don't

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.609 
Catholics especially paddlers that don't
have<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.149> lot<00:01:17.300> of<00:01:17.330> experience<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.170> real<00:01:18.380> tight
