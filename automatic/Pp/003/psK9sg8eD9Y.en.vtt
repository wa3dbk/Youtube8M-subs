 and above all make people laugh in places where 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.810
 I think more is needed 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.720
 and you feel better and feel like you're doing 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.160
 something useful and the best that I can 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 do it better than I think if doing is 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.660
 make people laugh so good 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.830
 I need to go to fencing expeditions 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.730
 inform whole because I think it is 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.730
 food for the soul 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.830
 good clowns without borders I think it's 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.820
 what comes closest to what is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.040
 my business I am a circus artist 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.040
 Labor has done different good 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.310
 disciplines and the truth that I feel 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.229
 identified with this ong clowns without 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.229
 borders 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.229
 and 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.560
 ah 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.560
 the revolution of laughter sees me 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.120
 the desire to change from the laugh 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.580
 not from 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.440
 how can 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.900
 all revolutions come from 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.410
 changes of affect from crisis and change 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.840
 a crisis of good humor from the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.050
 joy what comes after the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.390
 joy better to come from there not 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.510
 from the sadness of spite that happens 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.620
 before for a smile and then starting 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.620
 hence the changes come 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.409
 we believe good me and the other clowns that 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.760
 laughter has a very strong power and 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.110
 We believe that we can change many things 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.110
 in this world through laughter 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.710
 good the revolution of laughter 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.640
 I think it's the most powerful weapon that 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.770
 we have all 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.569
 and the most powerful one of the children's 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:11.310
 because one dies or laughs is something very 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:14.400
 cute and I think that revolution has 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.280
 to be full of joy 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.480
 a welfare a better world as well 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.939
 say it and I think laughter is the weapon 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.800
 we have all and it costs nothing 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.310

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.310

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.100

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.010

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.079

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.349

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.240
 it could be generated and good that they continue 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.480

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.480
 more expeditions and where else where 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.390
 they need it not and especially the children 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.390
