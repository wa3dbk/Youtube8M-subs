okay this is how to change the steering
wheel<00:00:05.640> on<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> Range<00:00:06.180> Rover<00:00:06.390> Sport<00:00:06.480> will<00:00:06.810> take

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
wheel on a Range Rover Sport will take

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.419 
wheel on a Range Rover Sport will take
you<00:00:07.170> through<00:00:07.200> its<00:00:07.500> butt<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.799> guidance<00:00:08.160> only

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
you through its butt for guidance only

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.950 
you through its butt for guidance only
obviously<00:00:08.970> you're<00:00:09.120> working<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.570> our<00:00:09.750> bags

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
obviously you're working with our bags

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.629 
obviously you're working with our bags
and<00:00:10.290> stuff<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.769> really<00:00:10.980> should<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.460> done<00:00:11.610> on

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
and stuff so really should be done on

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.970 
and stuff so really should be done on
the<00:00:11.820> main<00:00:12.000> dealers<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.259> guidance<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the main dealers but this is guidance to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
the main dealers but this is guidance to
show<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.429> we've<00:00:14.549> got<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.660> is

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
show you what we've got to do so this is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.099 
show you what we've got to do so this is
the<00:00:15.990> bare<00:00:16.199> steering<00:00:16.920> wheel<00:00:17.660> now<00:00:18.660> problems<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the bare steering wheel now problems you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.630 
the bare steering wheel now problems you
get<00:00:19.260> often<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> steering<00:00:20.160> wheels<00:00:20.400> if

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
get often with the steering wheels if

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.820 
get often with the steering wheels if
they<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.570> leather<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:22.350> tends<00:00:22.619> to

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
they the leather really tends to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.349 
they the leather really tends to
deteriorate<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.730> tell<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.060> you've<00:00:24.180> got<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
deteriorate you can tell if you've got a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
deteriorate you can tell if you've got a
leather<00:00:24.660> steering<00:00:25.019> wheel<00:00:25.230> because<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.130> got

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
leather steering wheel because it's got

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
leather steering wheel because it's got
stitches<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> discoveries<00:00:28.019> have

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
stitches some of the discoveries have

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
stitches some of the discoveries have
the<00:00:28.349> same<00:00:28.560> steering<00:00:28.920> wheel<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.119> have

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the same steering wheel but they have

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
the same steering wheel but they have
it's<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.109> molded<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.769> can't<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it's just molded you can't see the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
it's just molded you can't see the
stitch<00:00:32.730> line<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> inside<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.350> people

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
stitch line on the inside so some people

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
stitch line on the inside so some people
upgrade<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> leather<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.910> they've<00:00:36.090> got

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
upgrade to the leather if they've got

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
upgrade to the leather if they've got
that<00:00:36.450> okay<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.559> first<00:00:37.770> thing<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.219> is

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that okay so the first thing to do is

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
that okay so the first thing to do is
start<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.180> your<00:00:39.239> steering<00:00:39.660> wheel<00:00:39.809> nominally

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
start with your steering wheel nominally

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
start with your steering wheel nominally
straight<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.790> we've<00:00:41.910> got<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
straight then what we've got to go and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
straight then what we've got to go and
do<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> front<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> disconnect

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
do is go into the front and disconnect

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
do is go into the front and disconnect
the<00:00:44.160> battery<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> airbag<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.440> we

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the battery because of the airbag so we

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.170 
the battery because of the airbag so we
go<00:00:46.800> around<00:00:46.920> open<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> bonnet<00:00:48.500> okay

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
go around open the bonnet okay

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.010 
go around open the bonnet okay
factories<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.690> compartment

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
factories in this little compartment

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.740 
factories in this little compartment
here<00:00:52.500> there's<00:00:53.160> two<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.730> switches<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.480> pull

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
here there's two little switches we pull

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
here there's two little switches we pull
out<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> 13

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
out there and then you need a 13

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
out there and then you need a 13
millimeters<00:00:57.539> per<00:00:57.809> day<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:59.399> going

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
millimeters per day and what I'm going

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.170 
millimeters per day and what I'm going
to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.180> disconnect<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.620> here

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
to do here is disconnect this one here

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
to do here is disconnect this one here
so<00:01:03.180> disconnect<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> whole

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so disconnect that and this whole

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
so disconnect that and this whole
assembly<00:01:04.920> comes<00:01:05.430> lifts<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.390> obviously<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
assembly comes lifts up obviously you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.810 
assembly comes lifts up obviously you
don't<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.530> touching<00:01:08.010> back<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
don't want that touching back on to the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
don't want that touching back on to the
assembly<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.080> pull<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> back<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
assembly so you just pull it back and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
assembly so you just pull it back and
hold<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> cover<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.180> keeps<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.659> off

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
hold the cover there that keeps that off

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
hold the cover there that keeps that off
right<00:01:13.740> next<00:01:14.700> back<00:01:14.970> inside<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.720> car<00:01:16.340> then<00:01:17.340> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
right next back inside the car then we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210 
right next back inside the car then we
need<00:01:18.000> okay<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> hook<00:01:19.560> tool<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.130> we

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
need okay this is the hook tool that we

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
need okay this is the hook tool that we
supply<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.210> basically<00:01:21.600> you've<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.990> pull<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
supply so basically you've got a pull to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
supply so basically you've got a pull to
pull<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.310> you've<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:24.240> hook<00:01:24.509> now

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
pull and you've got a little hook now

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469 
pull and you've got a little hook now
we've<00:01:24.900> marked<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:26.729> deep<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.270> should

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
we've marked on here how deep it should

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
we've marked on here how deep it should
go<00:01:27.659> into<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.140> housing<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.100> let's<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.700> do

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
go into the housing so let's go and do

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.780 
go into the housing so let's go and do
that<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.860> underneath<00:01:32.280> on

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that now so if you look underneath on

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.969 
that now so if you look underneath on
this<00:01:33.000> airbag<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.780> I'll<00:01:33.900> point<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.710> on

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this airbag here I'll point to it on on

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
this airbag here I'll point to it on on
the<00:01:35.490> rear<00:01:35.820> casing<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> steering<00:01:37.079> where

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the rear casing of the steering where

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.200 
the rear casing of the steering where
you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.189> little<00:01:38.340> hexagonal<00:01:39.060> hole

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you can see the little hexagonal hole

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.870 
you can see the little hexagonal hole
and<00:01:39.840> you've<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.200> insert<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> hook<00:01:41.189> with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and you've got to insert the hook with

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.480 
and you've got to insert the hook with
the<00:01:41.909> end<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> hook<00:01:42.810> facing<00:01:43.680> towards<00:01:44.280> you

okay so we've gone into the plastic just
meets<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.610> housing<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.500> there

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
meets the housing there we can do there

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
meets the housing there we can do there
is<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.159> push<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> air<00:01:56.939> back<00:01:57.119> slightly

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
is we can push on the air back slightly

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.929 
is we can push on the air back slightly
and<00:01:57.899> then<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:59.070> release<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> spring

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and then that will release the spring

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.850 
and then that will release the spring
you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.210> feel<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.600> pulling<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> the

you can feel it pulling and you see the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.440 
you can feel it pulling and you see the
air<00:02:01.950> bags<00:02:02.219> come<00:02:02.460> away<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> front<00:02:03.149> here

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
air bags come away at the front here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510

see in the light here but what we've got

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.699 
see in the light here but what we've got
in<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.980> there's<00:03:42.550> two<00:03:42.850> pins<00:03:43.530> alright<00:03:44.530> you

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
in there is there's two pins alright you

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.170 
in there is there's two pins alright you
can<00:03:44.860> see<00:03:44.890> there's<00:03:45.250> an<00:03:45.340> alignment<00:03:45.610> on<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
can see there's an alignment on the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180 
can see there's an alignment on the
steering<00:03:46.510> wheel<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.110> also<00:03:47.440> an<00:03:47.560> alignment<00:03:47.890> on

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
the central shaft so note that but put

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.260 
the central shaft so note that but put
it<00:03:50.890> normally<00:03:51.310> straight<00:03:51.640> when<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:51.970> put<00:03:52.150> them

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
it normally straight when you put them

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.990 
it normally straight when you put them
back<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.600> make<00:03:52.780> sure<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:53.170> line<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:54.250> Demark<00:03:54.790> on

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
back in make sure you line the Demark on

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.190

the steering wheel up with the mark on
the<00:03:56.350> shaft<00:03:57.180> okay<00:03:58.180> then<00:03:58.360> what<00:03:58.450> we<00:03:58.540> need<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.780> do

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the shaft okay then what we need to do

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.330 
the shaft okay then what we need to do
acting<00:03:59.260> before<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.709> pull<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.040> off<00:04:00.160> is

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
acting before we just pull it off is

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.070 
acting before we just pull it off is
just<00:04:00.370> release<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.150> white<00:04:01.450> connector<00:04:01.959> so

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
just release this white connector so

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.350 
just release this white connector so
there's<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.290> little<00:04:02.620> tab<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.700> top<00:04:03.970> we<00:04:04.180> just

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
there's a little tab on the top we just

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.610 
there's a little tab on the top we just
push<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.870> down

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
push that down

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.800 
push that down
pull<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.129> white<00:04:06.340> connector<00:04:06.910> out<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.420> then

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
pull that white connector out and then

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.170 
pull that white connector out and then
what<00:04:07.930> we<00:04:08.019> can<00:04:08.110> do<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.379> carefully<00:04:09.160> all<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
what we can do is carefully all the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.240 
what we can do is carefully all the
steering<00:04:10.599> wheel<00:04:10.780> guide<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.650> two<00:04:11.860> airbag

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
steering wheel guide the two airbag

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.640 
steering wheel guide the two airbag
connector<00:04:12.730> wires<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.989> then<00:04:14.260> we've<00:04:14.440> got

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
connector wires out and then we've got

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.560 
connector wires out and then we've got
this<00:04:14.860> now<00:04:15.489> what<00:04:15.730> we<00:04:15.819> need<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.030> do<00:04:16.239> now<00:04:16.419> is

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
this now what we need to do now is

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.539 
this now what we need to do now is
obviously<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:17.229> is<00:04:17.500> different<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.310> bare

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
obviously this is different to the bare

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.699 
obviously this is different to the bare
core<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.180> I've<00:04:19.299> got<00:04:19.570> here<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.320> what<00:04:20.470> we<00:04:20.560> need

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
core that I've got here and what we need

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.650 
core that I've got here and what we need
to<00:04:20.799> do<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.070> remove<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.430> rear<00:04:21.850> housing<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.600> the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
to do is remove the rear housing and the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.200 
to do is remove the rear housing and the
switch<00:04:22.930> packs<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.770> keep<00:04:24.100> those<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.970> same

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
switch packs so you keep those the same

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.110 
switch packs so you keep those the same
as<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.479> car<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.470> do<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.889> there's<00:04:27.669> four

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
as the car and to do that there's four

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.560 
as the car and to do that there's four
screws<00:04:28.900> on<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.199> back<00:04:29.290> here<00:04:29.590> one<00:04:29.860> two<00:04:30.610> three

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
screws on the back here one two three

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.629 
screws on the back here one two three
four<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.680> then<00:04:32.860> what<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.070> can<00:04:33.220> do<00:04:33.340> is<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
four and then what you can do is the

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.120 
four and then what you can do is the
switch<00:04:33.910> packs<00:04:34.240> pull<00:04:34.630> forwards<00:04:35.139> okay<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.919> can

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
switch packs pull forwards okay you can

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.790 
switch packs pull forwards okay you can
swap<00:04:36.430> those<00:04:36.610> over<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.270> then<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.530> push

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
swap those over and then you can push

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.040 
swap those over and then you can push
the<00:04:38.979> rear<00:04:39.130> casing<00:04:39.700> because<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.419> rear<00:04:40.570> casing
