fairly<00:00:18.570> securely<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:20.060> sort<00:00:21.060> of

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
fairly securely so we have to sort of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.340 
fairly securely so we have to sort of
tilt<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.750> forward<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.740> pull<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:24.350> and

tilt this forward to pull it out and
we'll<00:00:25.439> set<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.710> aside<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.310> moment<00:00:27.050> over

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we'll set this aside for a moment over

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.950 
we'll set this aside for a moment over
here<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> power<00:00:29.609> cords<00:00:30.090> some

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
here we have when the power cords some

this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.730> Ethernet<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:49.110> plug

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this is for Ethernet so you can plug

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is for Ethernet so you can plug
this<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> ports<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.230> get<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
this into one of the ports and get a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
this into one of the ports and get a
wired<00:00:52.559> Ethernet<00:00:53.039> connection<00:00:53.460> taking<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> look

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
wired Ethernet connection taking a look

wired Ethernet connection taking a look
at<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> notebook<00:00:54.930> itself<00:00:55.379> we've<00:00:55.980> seen<00:00:56.250> this

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
at the notebook itself we've seen this

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.900 
at the notebook itself we've seen this
at<00:00:56.579> CES<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> 15-inch<00:00:58.350> system<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> has<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
at CES it's a 15-inch system and has a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.619 
at CES it's a 15-inch system and has a
screen<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.379> resolution<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.510> 1600<00:01:03.510> x

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
screen that has a resolution of 1600 x
900<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> matte<00:01:05.820> display

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
900 and we like it has a matte display

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
900 and we like it has a matte display
too<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.140> won't<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.560> much<00:01:07.710> glare

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
too so there won't be as much glare

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.929 
too so there won't be as much glare
other<00:01:09.060> inside<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.770> will<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.580> core

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
other inside of it it will have a core

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
switched over the other side here we

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
switched over the other side here we
have<00:01:47.340> yet<00:01:47.520> another<00:01:47.729> adapter<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.630> another<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
have yet another adapter here another to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.550 
have yet another adapter here another to
actually<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:50.009> well<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> regular<00:01:51.720> USB<00:01:52.110> port

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.490 
actually as well as a regular USB port
you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> design<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you can see the design of it is very

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.609 
you can see the design of it is very
similar<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.820> second<00:01:57.540> generation<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
similar to the second generation of the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.550 
similar to the second generation of the
samsung<00:01:59.130> series<00:01:59.610> 9<00:01:59.640> 13<00:02:00.420> inch<00:02:00.600> obviously<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
samsung series 9 13 inch obviously this

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
samsung series 9 13 inch obviously this
is<00:02:01.710> 15<00:02:02.430> inches<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:03.360> other<00:02:03.509> thing<00:02:03.630> about<00:02:03.840> this

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
is 15 inches one other thing about this
