purpose<00:00:33.570> apart<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> fact<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
purpose apart from the fact that the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.240 
purpose apart from the fact that the
melting<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.960> much<00:00:37.230> much<00:00:37.410> easier<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
melting is much much easier when you

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.049 
melting is much much easier when you
have<00:00:38.399> smaller<00:00:38.760> pieces<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.260> chocolate<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
have smaller pieces and the chocolate is

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
have smaller pieces and the chocolate is
quite<00:00:42.059> bitter<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.170> need<00:00:43.350> something<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
quite bitter so we need something to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.000 
quite bitter so we need something to
round<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.399> off<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.210> something<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
round it off and that something is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
round it off and that something is
butter<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.430> we're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> whole

when<00:01:33.110> melting<00:01:34.110> chocolate<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:35.040> feel<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
when melting chocolate I don't feel that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.090 
when melting chocolate I don't feel that
that's<00:01:35.850> necessary<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.530> long<00:01:37.950> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
that's necessary I think that as long as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.450 
that's necessary I think that as long as
you<00:01:38.220> used<00:01:38.460> relatively<00:01:39.119> low<00:01:39.540> heat<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.460> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you used relatively low heat and you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.940 
you used relatively low heat and you
stir<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> lot<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> safe<00:01:43.920> side

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
stir a lot then you're on the safe side

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
stir a lot then you're on the safe side
and<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.909> doesn't<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.600> than<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.810> couple

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and it doesn't take more than a couple

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.340 
and it doesn't take more than a couple
of<00:01:46.140> minutes<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> chocolate<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> melt<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
of minutes for the chocolate to melt and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.530 
of minutes for the chocolate to melt and
now<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.280> two<00:01:50.759> guests<00:01:51.240> tonight

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
now I'm going to have two guests tonight

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.179 
now I'm going to have two guests tonight
so<00:01:51.659> I'm<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> pour<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.090> mixture<00:01:54.420> into

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
so I'm going to pour this mixture into

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.179 
so I'm going to pour this mixture into
three<00:01:56.450> small<00:01:57.450> individual<00:01:58.079> malts<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.680> that's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
three small individual malts and that's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.069 
three small individual malts and that's
really<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
really all there is to it

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.980 
really all there is to it
but<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> course<00:02:02.090> these<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.360> very<00:02:03.750> very

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
but now of course these are very very

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.289 
but now of course these are very very
runny<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.850> place<00:02:06.090> them

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
runny so I have to place them

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.940 
runny so I have to place them
in<00:02:07.810> my<00:02:08.709> freezer<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:10.360> are<00:02:10.629> just<00:02:10.869> ice<00:02:11.379> cubes

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
in my freezer which are just ice cubes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.110 
in my freezer which are just ice cubes

if you are doing this at home just pop

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.860
