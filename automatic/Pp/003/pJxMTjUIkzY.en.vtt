weapons and an angel porn which you can

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.340 
weapons and an angel porn which you can
do<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.280> same<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:45.880> you've<00:01:46.600> got<00:01:46.750> three<00:01:46.990> sets<00:01:47.229> of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
do the same so you've got three sets of

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.469 
do the same so you've got three sets of
weapons<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:48.009> within<00:01:48.310> each<00:01:48.520> set<00:01:48.820> there<00:01:49.300> are

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
weapons and within each set there are

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.139 
weapons and within each set there are
multiple<00:01:49.840> versions<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.680> weapons<00:01:51.100> as<00:01:51.220> well<00:01:51.399> so

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
multiple versions of weapons as well so

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.840 
multiple versions of weapons as well so
the<00:01:52.270> idea<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.890> broaden<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.490> amount<00:01:54.729> of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
the idea is to broaden the amount of

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.219 
the idea is to broaden the amount of
weapons<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.420> allow<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.929> switch<00:01:56.110> between

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
weapons and allow you to switch between

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.430 
weapons and allow you to switch between
them<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.979> fly<00:01:57.539> with<00:01:58.539> angel<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.110> demon

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
them on the fly with angel and demon

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.410 
them on the fly with angel and demon
you're<00:01:59.649> also<00:01:59.800> able<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.310> have<00:02:00.580> other<00:02:00.850> abilities

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
the environment ripping out parts of the
environment<00:02:13.260> traversing<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.470> we're<00:02:14.590> adding

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
environment traversing so we're adding

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.810 
environment traversing so we're adding
some<00:02:16.560> kind<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.590> dynamics<00:02:18.100> are<00:02:18.280> outside<00:02:18.700> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
some kind of dynamics are outside of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.960 
some kind of dynamics are outside of
combat<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> series<00:02:20.250> yeah<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.760> demons

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
combat to the series yeah so the demons

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.090 
combat to the series yeah so the demons
exist<00:02:22.269> in<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.780> parallel<00:02:23.470> well<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.829> a<00:02:23.890> very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
exist in this parallel well it's a very

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.430 
exist in this parallel well it's a very
malignant<00:02:24.549> world<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.269> it's<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.900> reflection<00:02:26.110> of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
malignant world and it's a reflection of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.920 
malignant world and it's a reflection of
our<00:02:26.620> world<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.130> we're<00:02:27.820> not<00:02:28.030> aware<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.450> how

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
our world and we're not aware of how

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.280 
our world and we're not aware of how
they're<00:02:29.140> manipulating<00:02:29.380> us<00:02:31.049> dancer<00:02:32.049> being

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
they're manipulating us dancer being

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.160 
they're manipulating us dancer being
having<00:02:32.829> demonic<00:02:33.310> blood<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:34.450> able<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.959> traverse

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
having demonic blood is able to traverse

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.069 
having demonic blood is able to traverse
into<00:02:35.950> these<00:02:36.070> worlds<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.790> see<00:02:37.090> see<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> world

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
into these worlds and see see the world

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.270 
into these worlds and see see the world
for<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.590> from<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.920> demonic

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
for what it is from the demonic

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.789 
for what it is from the demonic
perspective<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.900> sense<00:02:40.930> he<00:02:41.230> can<00:02:41.500> see<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
perspective so in a sense he can see the

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.440 
perspective so in a sense he can see the
truth<00:02:42.040> behind<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.579> illusion<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.060> all<00:02:43.209> live<00:02:43.420> in

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
truth behind the illusion we all live in

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.259 
truth behind the illusion we all live in
and<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.769> he's<00:02:45.010> got<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.340> power<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.670> fight<00:02:46.000> back

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
and so he's got the power to fight back

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.110 
and so he's got the power to fight back
against<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.140> forces<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:48.120> manipulating

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
against the forces that are manipulating

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.720 
against the forces that are manipulating
us<00:02:49.239> without<00:02:50.019> going<00:02:50.470> too<00:02:50.829> much<00:02:50.860> into<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.489> story

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
us without going too much into the story

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.289 
us without going too much into the story
at<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.090> stage<00:02:52.799> Dante's<00:02:53.799> young<00:02:54.040> he's<00:02:54.940> um

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
at this stage Dante's young he's um

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.690 
at this stage Dante's young he's um
there's<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.260> reason<00:02:56.590> why<00:02:56.739> he's<00:02:56.980> angry<00:02:57.430> there's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
there's a reason why he's angry there's

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970 
there's a reason why he's angry there's
a<00:02:57.760> reason<00:02:57.940> why<00:02:58.209> he<00:02:58.390> hates<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.870> demons<00:02:59.260> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
a reason why he hates the demons and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.500 
a reason why he hates the demons and
that<00:03:00.130> reason<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.579> because<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.030> demons<00:03:01.390> have

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
that reason is because the demons have

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.240 
that reason is because the demons have
affected<00:03:01.959> him<00:03:02.079> personally

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
affected him personally

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.730 
affected him personally
as<00:03:04.240> he's<00:03:04.450> growing<00:03:04.570> up<00:03:04.780> if<00:03:04.930> infected<00:03:05.260> his<00:03:05.530> life

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
as he's growing up if infected his life

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.340 
as he's growing up if infected his life
like<00:03:06.190> hundred<00:03:06.610> they<00:03:07.360> put<00:03:07.570> people<00:03:07.870> down<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
like hundred they put people down the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.350 
like hundred they put people down the
demons<00:03:08.740> through<00:03:09.190> whatever<00:03:09.640> means<00:03:09.820> it's<00:03:10.210> like

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
demons through whatever means it's like

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.450 
demons through whatever means it's like
so<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.960> demo<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.350> showed<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.950> demons

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
so in a demo we showed that the demons

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.040 
so in a demo we showed that the demons
are<00:03:12.640> surveilling<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.270> population<00:03:13.870> through

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
are surveilling the population through

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.080 
are surveilling the population through
their<00:03:14.200> cameras<00:03:14.590> when<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.550> demon<00:03:15.820> world<00:03:15.940> those

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
their cameras when the demon world those

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.690 
their cameras when the demon world those
cameras<00:03:16.540> are<00:03:16.780> demonic<00:03:17.560> eyes<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.310> things<00:03:18.520> that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
cameras are demonic eyes and things that
