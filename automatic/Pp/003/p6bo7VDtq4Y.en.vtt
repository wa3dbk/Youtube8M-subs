00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.469
 a few little ago we had here 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.379
 the ef 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.359
 500 mm 4 lts mark 2 on the table and the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.449
 legs of this table are being re-up 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.369
 put it to the test with a young brother 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.179
 of those here fantastic for lens and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.329
 that is the 200 400 mm 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.130
 Fill 4 el yes with the built-in 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.410
 by a lesson that was years ago 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.560
 arrive is 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.450
 smells queen language in roads has but 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.510
 in the end you are one light in the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.240
 store and bright dress on the down that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.090
 he is a tough boy, he is purely solid 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:56.460
 and carried out, and zoom range of 200 400 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.140
 meter with railway strong 4 maximum 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.870
 that means sits a lot was in a lot 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.790
 weight and these types of lenses and also 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.009
 lives with its own 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 because if went well but what is known 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.150
 is from that l 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.159
 Lenses that have telephoto lenses are at their core 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.370
 it qualitatively almost indestructible 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.440
 are you see it is your best to the 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.440
 younger son slightly downsizing 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 by taking off his hood must 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 clarify how long the lens is in 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.350
 reality it is a boy who 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.510
 she weighs more than seven pounds 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.729
 newborn baby you have a proper weight 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.280
 and therefore also for this wish together with a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.680
 one that I speak who together weigh 5 pounds 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.620
 and then such a decent weight in which 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 which is different from the other in them 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.190
 one super telephoto lens is that you are now 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 that's the 100 yen shop and in the back 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.330
 300 soup but really from that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.409
 Bright changes guys like it 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.000
 300 400 500 euros mm yes it is not possible 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.040
 which deviates me from the he can zoom 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.180
 look there is a very big one 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.950
 zoom ring that gives you 200 than 400 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.220
 meter can 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.220
 modest chefs ring three sets 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.540
 everything had a dream that is beautiful 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.540
 dental braces 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 there are still very small items for this 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.440
 the hand focus is everything here 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.430
 image stabilization and yes magic of 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.409
 this lens 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 which still is in this piece because there is 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.370
 a built-in could continue 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.379
 celebrate a point so extend it 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.010
 focal point of claire us after four hundred 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:42.760
 to contact at 560 yes then you still have 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.690
 a nice reach and yes that's in that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.730
 piece we will now that something what 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.129
 take a closer look and especially hear 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.160
 sometimes look nice because how we are 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.709
 back with a close-up of the heart of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
 This unique lens is the one point four 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.980
 concerts 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.450
 you lose about it is a stoppie 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.730
 light along so you are going to use that thing 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.609
 then you go from 4 to 5 and 6 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.290
 but well this lens has proven with them 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.120
 maximum focal point and or then four or 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.430
 five or six is just her sharpness 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.349
 make corner to corner between that 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.609
 no matter if you are four or five and six 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.040
 but where it slightly holes 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.359
 how does it work now and yes i have something 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.370
 with the sound I belong to that he 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.079
 is now on one time so that means the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.180
 lesson is now 200 400 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.690
 I would suggest to him at one point four 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.680
 use 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.120
 you switch the button and then 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.599
 you blow it out you can hear will rent 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.599
 reset again 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.049
 this is completely muted so you come 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.590
 from his cottage thieves cover that here 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.829
 sees yes and I write it in the image 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.379
 going beautifully 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.139
 I also feel that you have this thousands 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.769
 can do without turning this up 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.530
 issues 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.090
 so lead you can do it while the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.220
 camera is on 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.660
 is no problem during the yes you know 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.040
 running the engine is yes then 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.769
 it gets a bit trickier but you stand it 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.049
 field and and a beast comes your way 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.549
 in principle the framework goes too much 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.299
 fill so you get a cut 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.590
 thereof 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.620
 he wants to zoom back that is also possible 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.690
 very simple just block off and from one 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.900
 point four to one and you go from 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.389
 208 mm 2 mm making you the one 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.419
 frame that perfect frame 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.620
 of a sports competition or of that 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.419
 that to den and the dog 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.340
 yes that you still just a moment 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.090
 can grab 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:41.249
 so this is the heart of one 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:44.029
 and 200 400 of them with the external 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.029
 just to listen 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.370
 magnificent
