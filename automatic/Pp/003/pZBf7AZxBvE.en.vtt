00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.980
 and here are the ice googlers of sony in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.349
 somehow you'll have to do 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.630
 pleasure but hey it's leaf to 2014 on 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 01net tv we found this product 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.410
 unusual that is still in the state 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.710
 of concept but that could happen 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.710
 very quickly 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.480
 Jerome is that they fit me his 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.529
 glasses it's a bit big one more 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 very big player 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.429
 good is that a concept we will not go out 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 like that in the street but that's it 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.820
 is embarking on this idea of glasses 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 connected like what is it really a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 general trend with a pretty concept 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 funny and that is effective ie 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.120
 than to have a small screen like on the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 google ice up right there actually 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.219
 we have two images that are superimposed 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.890
 on the greens and we turn so this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.930
 printing of a wide screen 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.550
 images coming from augmented reality 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.050
 in fact and it is very very very nice 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.449
 stereoscopic assystem 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 yes what makes that truly 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.050
 the screen is the full width of the field 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 of vision and is superimposed on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 the actual image 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 that's good for now 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.659
 we see that it is not yet 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.630
 truly, I almost fell 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 with a system that is connected to the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.319
 pair of glasses or there is hiding any 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 the intelligence one of the glasses there is the 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:17.579
 battery plus the processor and that's 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 still a little big we see it obviously 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.719
 that could not do it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.649
 commercially so the stakes for sony 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.659
 in the coming months it will be 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.450
 to integrate sarah the lunar interior to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.299
 the very interior of actually arriving at 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 miniaturize all this so that precisely 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.090
 we are glasses that looks like 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 real glasses finally then as on 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.750
 google ice cream is also a small 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.549
 camera camera wi that helps 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.989
 take pictures to take pictures 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.670
 you have the left tignes 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.979
 hot it's normal it's normal I'm 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 terminator everything is fine will have to that 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.039
 I was actually going to me to when 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.349
 fun is that there you have a 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.329
 kind of small virtual touch currency 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.189
 which actually allows you to do 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.569
 change menus that scrolled during 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.189
 that I speak to you I see this in the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.719
 pair of glasses menus that scroll 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.000
 the gold unlike google class 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.670
 are not you know it because and a support 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.040
 a rod to see there there are greens and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.210
 which may be corrective lenses 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.720
 adapted to the view of the person who 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.450
 use 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.770
 so when it comes out and well here we have 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.420
 tried to pull the information to 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.160
 the sony engineer who explained to us 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.240
 all this no date for the moment but 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.190
 maybe next year 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.870
 and yes why not they still have some 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.640
 good job they are a little bit in 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.560
 delay on the shot yes it's true but 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.060
 in any case we have here but you are the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.140
 concept is a lot nicer than 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.220
 the gas groups since there as I 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.300
 said it just now we see 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.310
 genuinely information that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.630
 is embedded in our field of vision and 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.130
 it's interesting for the moment four 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.840
 applications available at a 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.670
 navigation application and then well 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.930
 sure all this will work with the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.090
 smartphone obviously say with a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.280
 smartphone innovation to follow 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 obviously in a few months during which 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.560
 cost and we will follow it of course on 01net 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 TV
