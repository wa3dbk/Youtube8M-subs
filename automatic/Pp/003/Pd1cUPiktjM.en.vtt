into his leg lift now Joel doesn't

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.779 
into his leg lift now Joel doesn't
initiate<00:00:20.100> his<00:00:20.609> momentum<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> early<00:00:22.789> Stevens

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
initiate his momentum that early Stevens

initiate his momentum that early Stevens
in<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> similar<00:00:24.269> boat<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> little

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
in a similar boat I like to see a little

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.689 
in a similar boat I like to see a little
bit<00:00:25.500> earlier<00:00:25.890> movement<00:00:26.310> come<00:00:26.430> under<00:00:26.670> your

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
bit earlier movement come under your

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
bit earlier movement come under your
lips<00:00:27.140> okay

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lips okay

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.939 
lips okay
I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.910> qualta<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> typically<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.500> age

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
I think qualta is typically at this age

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.040 
I think qualta is typically at this age
in<00:00:32.130> end<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.700> his<00:00:32.850> career<00:00:33.030> he's<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.630> wouldn't

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
in end of his career he's and wouldn't

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
in end of his career he's and wouldn't
say<00:00:34.140> end<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.410> his<00:00:34.530> career<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.890> he's<00:00:34.980> he's<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
say end of his career but he's he's a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.139 
say end of his career but he's he's a
veteran<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> game<00:00:36.390> he's<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
veteran in the game he's you know not a

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.190 
veteran in the game he's you know not a
mid-90s<00:00:39.149> guy<00:00:39.390> he's<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> high

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
mid-90s guy he's more like a high

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080 
mid-90s guy he's more like a high
eighties<00:00:40.469> loan<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.800> these<00:00:40.920> guys<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.730> think

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
eighties loan on these guys so I think

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.500 
eighties loan on these guys so I think
he<00:00:42.410> he<00:00:43.410> still<00:00:43.800> could<00:00:44.160> gain<00:00:44.879> more<00:00:45.180> ball<00:00:45.480> speed

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
he he still could gain more ball speed

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
he he still could gain more ball speed
if<00:00:45.930> he<00:00:46.110> carried<00:00:46.649> his<00:00:46.800> momentum<00:00:47.250> earlier<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
if he carried his momentum earlier but

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.110 
if he carried his momentum earlier but
y'all<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.600> doing<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> same<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.850> let's<00:00:50.850> see

y'all are doing the same here let's see
how<00:00:51.239> how<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> load<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.949> how<00:00:53.070> he<00:00:53.129> loads<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
how how you load or how he loads it to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.229 
how how you load or how he loads it to
your<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.510> load<00:00:55.219> okay<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.149> in

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
your to your load okay you can see in

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.610 
your to your load okay you can see in
your<00:00:57.390> left<00:00:57.600> leg<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> reached<00:00:58.410> out

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
your left leg you kind of reached out

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.860 
your left leg you kind of reached out
earlier<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.129> lift<00:00:59.460> leg<00:00:59.670> he<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.750> he

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
earlier with your lift leg he can he

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.240 
earlier with your lift leg he can he
holds<00:01:01.170> his<00:01:01.320> back<00:01:01.590> okay

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

I like to whatever you do I just don't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.280 
I like to whatever you do I just don't
want<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> shift<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.360> momentum<00:01:06.689> with

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
want to see you shift your momentum with

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
want to see you shift your momentum with
your<00:01:07.500> lift<00:01:07.650> legs<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.490> lift<00:01:08.670> leg

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
your lift legs so when your lift leg

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.510 
your lift legs so when your lift leg
comes<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.510> definitely<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
comes down we definitely don't want it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
comes down we definitely don't want it
causing<00:01:11.520> any<00:01:11.610> type<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> early<00:01:12.360> shift<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
causing any type of early shift of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.530 
causing any type of early shift of
momentum<00:01:13.439> before<00:01:13.799> front<00:01:14.220> foot<00:01:14.340> strike<00:01:14.540> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
momentum before front foot strike you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
momentum before front foot strike you
are<00:01:15.630> keeping<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.110> chin<00:01:16.320> behind<00:01:16.619> belt<00:01:16.830> buckle

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
are keeping your chin behind belt buckle

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.090 
are keeping your chin behind belt buckle
which<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> good<00:01:18.229> Joel<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> keeping<00:01:19.710> his<00:01:19.860> chin

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
which is good Joel is keeping his chin

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
which is good Joel is keeping his chin
more<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> line<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.610> his<00:01:20.909> belt<00:01:21.150> buckle<00:01:21.330> you're

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
more in line with his belt buckle you're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
more in line with his belt buckle you're
both<00:01:22.259> loaded<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.710> back<00:01:22.979> leg<00:01:23.330> his<00:01:24.330> knees

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
both loaded on your back leg his knees

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.840 
both loaded on your back leg his knees
more<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.080> torsion<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.920> turned<00:01:26.400> outward

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
more in torsion which is turned outward

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.620 
more in torsion which is turned outward
yours<00:01:27.689> isn't<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> line<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
yours isn't more just in line I like it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
yours isn't more just in line I like it
being<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:31.079> outward<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.189> forward

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
being more outward as you go forward

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
being more outward as you go forward
keeps<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.659> stability<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> leg<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
keeps the stability on the leg and you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.069 
keeps the stability on the leg and you
typically<00:01:35.070> drive<00:01:35.430> better<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
typically drive better so going in the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.249 
typically drive better so going in the
front<00:01:37.320> foot<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.040> Joel<00:01:38.750> opens<00:01:39.750> goes

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
front foot we can see Joel opens goes

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
front foot we can see Joel opens goes
into<00:01:40.470> interent<00:01:40.890> ation<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.970> leg

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
into interent ation with a little leg

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.710 
into interent ation with a little leg
drive<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.790> lot<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> leg<00:01:45.060> drive<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.540> would

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
drive not not a lot of leg drive I would

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
drive not not a lot of leg drive I would
like<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.229> him<00:01:46.439> implement<00:01:46.799> more<00:01:47.130> leg<00:01:47.369> drive

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like to see him implement more leg drive

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
like to see him implement more leg drive
but<00:01:47.790> still<00:01:48.090> he<00:01:48.240> gets<00:01:48.509> almost<00:01:49.229> full<00:01:49.680> extension

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
but still he gets almost full extension

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
but still he gets almost full extension
into<00:01:50.460> his<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:50.759> leg<00:01:51.000> drive<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> front

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
into his back leg drive in the front

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
into his back leg drive in the front
foot<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.649> where<00:01:53.009> Joel<00:01:53.850> would

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
foot I think that's where Joel would

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.420 
foot I think that's where Joel would
pick<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.600> speed<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.200> notice<00:01:55.799> he<00:01:56.159> talks

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
pick up more speed but notice he talks

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.179 
pick up more speed but notice he talks
the<00:01:56.579> ball<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.439> doesn't<00:01:58.439> start<00:01:58.860> early

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the ball really well doesn't start early

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
the ball really well doesn't start early
trunk<00:01:59.460> rotation<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.360> still<00:02:00.450> see

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
trunk rotation you can see you still see

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
trunk rotation you can see you still see
his<00:02:00.810> glove<00:02:01.079> side<00:02:01.259> after<00:02:01.649> front<00:02:01.890> foot<00:02:02.100> strike

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
his glove side after front foot strike

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.999 
his glove side after front foot strike
okay<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.770> you're

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
okay for you here you can see you're

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
okay for you here you can see you're
just<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.579> falling<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> front<00:02:06.479> foot<00:02:06.689> so

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
just you're falling in the front foot so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.440 
just you're falling in the front foot so
definitely<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.069> significant<00:02:08.970> drive<00:02:09.209> there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
definitely not a significant drive there

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.540 
definitely not a significant drive there
at<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> fall<00:02:10.739> Joel<00:02:11.069> definitely

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
at all more of a fall Joel definitely

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.270 
at all more of a fall Joel definitely
has<00:02:11.670> more<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.120> push<00:02:12.390> call<00:02:12.690> coming<00:02:13.050> off

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
has more of a push call coming off

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.130 
has more of a push call coming off
back<00:02:13.430> foot<00:02:13.670> than<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.060> you're<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:14.930> kind<00:02:15.110> of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
back foot than you you're just kind of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.050 
back foot than you you're just kind of
rolling<00:02:15.410> over<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> collapsing<00:02:16.550> over<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:16.940> your

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
rolling over a collapsing over on your

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.540 
rolling over a collapsing over on your
back<00:02:17.240> foot<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.319> really<00:02:18.590> not<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.800> drive<00:02:19.220> going

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
back foot so really not a drive going

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.059 
back foot so really not a drive going
forward<00:02:19.970> which<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.660> not<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.410> create

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
forward which is not going to create

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.000 
forward which is not going to create
help<00:02:22.940> create<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> lot<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.630> torque<00:02:23.959> between<00:02:24.709> your

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
help create a lot of torque between your

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.320 
help create a lot of torque between your
hips<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.310> shoulders<00:02:25.730> which<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.060> what<00:02:26.180> we're

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
hips and shoulders which is what we're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.000 
hips and shoulders which is what we're
trying<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.569> do<00:02:26.780> which<00:02:26.990> accelerates<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> upper

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
trying to do which accelerates the upper

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
trying to do which accelerates the upper
body<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.910> hit<00:02:29.030> fun<00:02:29.209> foot<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.630> then<00:02:29.720> your

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
body so you hit fun foot and then your

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.949 
body so you hit fun foot and then your
hips<00:02:30.250> open<00:02:31.250> about<00:02:31.459> right<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.840> can

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
hips open about right here and you can

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:33.940 
hips open about right here and you can
see<00:02:33.140> your<00:02:33.260> hips<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.500> shoulders<00:02:33.560> are<00:02:33.920> moving

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
see your hips and shoulders are moving

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
see your hips and shoulders are moving
together<00:02:34.370> at<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.940> point<00:02:34.970> now<00:02:35.780> your<00:02:35.989> your

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
together at that point now your your

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.520 
together at that point now your your
cocking<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> little<00:02:36.980> oh<00:02:37.190> well<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.150> guess<00:02:38.690> you're

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
cocking a little oh well I guess you're

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.750 
cocking a little oh well I guess you're
just<00:02:39.709> getting<00:02:39.950> extended<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.520> your<00:02:40.640> arm

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
just getting extended on your arm

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.660 
just getting extended on your arm
cocking<00:02:41.060> you're<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.270> cocking<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.720> too<00:02:41.900> early

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
cocking you're not cocking it too early

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.100 
cocking you're not cocking it too early
you<00:02:43.670> are<00:02:43.880> keeping<00:02:44.270> your<00:02:44.390> shoulders<00:02:44.780> close<00:02:44.989> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
you are keeping your shoulders close to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.900 
you are keeping your shoulders close to
the<00:02:45.170> front<00:02:45.380> foot<00:02:45.530> which<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.860> good<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.820> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
the front foot which is good just the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.520 
the front foot which is good just the
negative<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.390> your<00:02:47.540> hips<00:02:47.720> aren't<00:02:47.959> open<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.380> by

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
negative is your hips aren't open so by

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.050 
negative is your hips aren't open so by
the<00:02:48.590> time<00:02:48.800> your<00:02:49.010> hips<00:02:49.190> do<00:02:49.459> open<00:02:49.790> which<00:02:49.910> is

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the time your hips do open which is

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.600 
the time your hips do open which is
taking<00:02:50.390> too<00:02:50.540> long<00:02:51.070> then<00:02:52.070> then<00:02:52.400> you're<00:02:52.519> already

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
taking too long then then you're already

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.310 
taking too long then then you're already
in<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> shoulder<00:02:53.180> rotation<00:02:53.630> that's<00:02:54.170> what

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
in the shoulder rotation that's what

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.630 
in the shoulder rotation that's what
we're<00:02:54.440> trying<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.739> do<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.070> trying<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:55.459> two

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
we're trying to do is trying to do two

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.430 
we're trying to do is trying to do two
things

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
things

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.160 
things
trying<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.220> get<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.430> front<00:02:58.670> foot<00:02:58.940> with<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> lot

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
trying to get to front foot with a lot

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.640 
trying to get to front foot with a lot
of<00:03:00.319> power<00:03:00.530> specifically<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> back<00:03:01.519> hip

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
of power specifically to the back hip

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.040 
of power specifically to the back hip
driving<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.739> hips<00:03:03.890> open<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:05.780> we

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
driving the hips open and then we

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.780 
driving the hips open and then we
initiate<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.650> upper<00:03:06.769> body<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.400> staying

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
initiate the upper body so staying

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.150 
initiate the upper body so staying
closed<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.350> point<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.769> typically

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
closed and to that point and typically

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.790 
closed and to that point and typically
it's<00:03:10.459> easier<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.880> stay<00:03:11.060> closed<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:12.440> your<00:03:12.590> hips

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
it's easier to stay closed if your hips

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.380 
it's easier to stay closed if your hips
can<00:03:12.950> open<00:03:13.190> earlier<00:03:13.519> after<00:03:13.700> front<00:03:14.060> foot<00:03:14.269> strike

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
can open earlier after front foot strike

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.140 
can open earlier after front foot strike
so<00:03:15.080> longer<00:03:15.319> we<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.620> wait<00:03:16.150> typically

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
so longer we have to wait typically

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.430 
so longer we have to wait typically
we're<00:03:17.329> going<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.780> start<00:03:18.049> our<00:03:18.170> shoulder

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
we're going to start our shoulder

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.350 
we're going to start our shoulder
rotation<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.519> can<00:03:19.700> see<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.269> you

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
rotation and you can see because you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.190 
rotation and you can see because you
don't<00:03:20.480> have<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.630> lot<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.840> hip<00:03:20.930> shoulder

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
don't have a lot of hip shoulder

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.539 
don't have a lot of hip shoulder
separation<00:03:21.440> you're<00:03:21.829> not<00:03:22.010> getting<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> big<00:03:22.519> load

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
separation you're not getting a big load

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.880 
separation you're not getting a big load
in<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.910> arm<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.510> we<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.780> see<00:03:23.959> Joel<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:24.739> he's

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
in the arm if we to see Joel here he's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.620 
in the arm if we to see Joel here he's
got<00:03:25.040> his<00:03:25.190> hips<00:03:25.400> pretty<00:03:25.670> much<00:03:25.820> open<00:03:26.180> shoulders

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
got his hips pretty much open shoulders

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.069 
got his hips pretty much open shoulders
still<00:03:26.870> closed<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.910> then<00:03:29.269> when<00:03:29.510> he<00:03:29.630> goes<00:03:29.840> into

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
still closed and then when he goes into

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.319 
still closed and then when he goes into
shoulder<00:03:30.380> rotation<00:03:30.950> he<00:03:31.430> gets<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.730> big<00:03:31.940> load<00:03:32.180> in

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
shoulder rotation he gets a big load in

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.840 
shoulder rotation he gets a big load in
the<00:03:32.420> arm<00:03:32.600> he<00:03:33.260> also<00:03:33.860> stabilizes<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.610> front

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
the arm he also stabilizes that front

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.190 
the arm he also stabilizes that front
leg<00:03:35.030> really<00:03:35.209> well<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.630> even<00:03:35.750> goes<00:03:36.019> in<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
leg really well and even goes in the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.220 
leg really well and even goes in the
front<00:03:36.440> leg<00:03:36.590> extension<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.430> pitch<00:03:37.640> release

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
front leg extension in the pitch release

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.170 
front leg extension in the pitch release
really<00:03:39.230> well<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:40.250> can<00:03:40.400> see<00:03:40.579> as<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.880> go<00:03:41.030> in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
really well and you can see as you go in

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.060 
really well and you can see as you go in
to<00:03:41.269> release<00:03:41.540> no<00:03:41.900> front<00:03:42.200> leg<00:03:42.320> extension<00:03:42.859> so

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
to release no front leg extension so

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.130 
to release no front leg extension so
you're<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:43.940> just<00:03:44.030> falling<00:03:44.480> off<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.930> mound

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
you're really just falling off the mound

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.490 
you're really just falling off the mound
and<00:03:45.380> then<00:03:46.100> just<00:03:47.079> stabilizing<00:03:48.079> your<00:03:48.140> front<00:03:48.350> leg

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
and then just stabilizing your front leg

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.750 
and then just stabilizing your front leg
but<00:03:48.650> not<00:03:48.680> even<00:03:48.920> driving<00:03:49.130> your<00:03:49.280> front<00:03:49.489> leg<00:03:49.640> so

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
but not even driving your front leg so

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.940 
but not even driving your front leg so
there's<00:03:49.940> there's<00:03:50.480> really<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.810> low<00:03:51.290> amount<00:03:51.739> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
there's there's really a low amount of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.130 
there's there's really a low amount of
lower<00:03:52.160> body<00:03:52.370> power<00:03:52.730> coming<00:03:53.060> out<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.299> you<00:03:53.480> which

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
lower body power coming out of you which

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.539 
lower body power coming out of you which
is<00:03:54.290> making<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.739> hard<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.370> really

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
is making it hard for you to really

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.160 
is making it hard for you to really
generate<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> lot<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.239> speeds<00:03:56.600> in<00:03:56.750> your<00:03:56.930> arm

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
generate a lot of speeds in your arm

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.020 
generate a lot of speeds in your arm
I<00:03:57.200> really<00:03:58.040> believe<00:03:58.280> when<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.549> get<00:03:58.730> your<00:03:58.880> lower

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
I really believe when you get your lower

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.759 
I really believe when you get your lower
body<00:03:59.209> going<00:03:59.480> your<00:03:59.660> arm<00:03:59.810> past<00:04:00.109> you<00:04:00.290> look<00:04:00.530> pretty

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
body going your arm past you look pretty

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:01.210 
body going your arm past you look pretty
good

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
good

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.599 
good
I<00:04:01.250> even<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.329> how<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.540> release<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.320> ball

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
I even like how you release the ball

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.729 
I even like how you release the ball
without<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.790> lot<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.260> where<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.380> don't<00:04:06.560> release

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
without a lot of where you don't release

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.930 
without a lot of where you don't release
the<00:04:06.859> ball<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.100> front<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.340> your<00:04:07.430> face<00:04:07.609> I<00:04:07.790> like

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
the ball in front of your face I like

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.120 
the ball in front of your face I like
how<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.120> release<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.630> quickly<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:09.829> that's

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
how you release it quickly and up that's

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.180 
how you release it quickly and up that's
a<00:04:10.250> good<00:04:10.280> arm<00:04:10.910> path<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.959> more<00:04:12.290> dynamic<00:04:12.709> your

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
a good arm path the more dynamic your

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.310 
a good arm path the more dynamic your
trunk<00:04:13.459> gets<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:13.880> pushes<00:04:14.209> out<00:04:14.359> more<00:04:15.109> of<00:04:15.140> your

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
trunk gets and pushes out more of your

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.690 
trunk gets and pushes out more of your
front<00:04:15.620> leg<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:15.920> your<00:04:16.039> front<00:04:16.220> leg<00:04:16.370> can<00:04:16.549> get

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
front leg and your front leg can get

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.460 
front leg and your front leg can get
extended<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.359> think<00:04:17.450> you're<00:04:17.720> set<00:04:18.049> up<00:04:18.079> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
extended so I think you're set up to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.740 
extended so I think you're set up to
really<00:04:19.100> start<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.549> throw<00:04:19.729> hard<00:04:20.000> but<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.600> got

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
really start to throw hard but you got

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.300 
really start to throw hard but you got
to<00:04:20.870> learn<00:04:21.049> how<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.320> load<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.830> drive<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.159> back

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
to learn how to load and drive the back

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.070 
to learn how to load and drive the back
leg<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.030> stabilize<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.810> drive<00:04:23.930> the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
leg and and stabilize and drive the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.540 
leg and and stabilize and drive the
front<00:04:24.289> leg<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.620> also<00:04:24.919> too<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.280> got<00:04:25.400> to

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
front leg and also too you got to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.050 
front leg and also too you got to
develop

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
develop

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570 
develop
a<00:04:26.180> lot<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.110> power<00:04:27.410> like<00:04:27.980> we<00:04:28.010> do<00:04:28.310> through

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
a lot of the power like we do through

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.300 
a lot of the power like we do through
our<00:04:28.630> Olympic<00:04:29.630> lifting<00:04:30.050> get<00:04:30.680> developed<00:04:31.220> that

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
our Olympic lifting get developed that

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.659 
our Olympic lifting get developed that
explosive<00:04:31.790> power<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.050> can<00:04:33.260> use<00:04:34.100> in<00:04:34.460> those

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
explosive power that we can use in those

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.940 
explosive power that we can use in those
movements<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.300> really<00:04:35.630> really<00:04:35.870> drive<00:04:36.200> more

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
movements to really really drive more

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.500 
movements to really really drive more
hip<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.250> shoulder<00:04:37.280> separation<00:04:37.580> torque<00:04:38.270> and

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
hip to shoulder separation torque and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.900 
hip to shoulder separation torque and
then<00:04:38.600> more<00:04:38.840> trunk<00:04:39.770> dynamics<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.639> more<00:04:40.790> arm

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
then more trunk dynamics and more arm

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.290 
then more trunk dynamics and more arm
speed<00:04:41.210> going<00:04:41.450> forward<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.639> yeah<00:04:43.639> this<00:04:44.060> really

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
speed going forward so yeah this really

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.670 
speed going forward so yeah this really
needs<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.630> be<00:04:44.690> your<00:04:44.840> focus<00:04:45.200> as<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.350> go<00:04:45.500> through

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
needs to be your focus as you go through

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.550 
needs to be your focus as you go through
3x<00:04:46.010> pitching<00:04:46.160> velocity<00:04:46.310> program<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:48.110> let<00:04:48.500> me

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
3x pitching velocity program and let me

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.340 
3x pitching velocity program and let me
know<00:04:48.680> if<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.800> have<00:04:48.889> any<00:04:49.010> questions
