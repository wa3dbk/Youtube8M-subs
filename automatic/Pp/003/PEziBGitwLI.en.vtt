so<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.079> when<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.710> agglutination

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
so here when you get this agglutination

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.799 
so here when you get this agglutination
before<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.899> study<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:59.730> literally<00:01:00.449> picked

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
before this study you literally picked

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.130 
before this study you literally picked
and<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.500> hoped<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.090> donor<00:01:03.300> wouldn't

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and you hoped that the donor wouldn't

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.070 
and you hoped that the donor wouldn't
cause<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> reaction<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.630> oftentimes<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.960> were

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
cause a reaction and oftentimes you were

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.350 
cause a reaction and oftentimes you were
doing<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> test<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.520> both<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> animals

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
doing the test as the both the animals

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
doing the test as the both the animals
were<00:01:09.510> sedated<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.229> wouldn't<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.740> know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
were sedated and wouldn't you know

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
were sedated and wouldn't you know
wasn't<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> frustrating<00:01:11.790> thing<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.150> sit

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
wasn't it a frustrating thing to sit

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
wasn't it a frustrating thing to sit
there<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.600> well<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.200> sedated<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
there and go well we just sedated this

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.690 
there and go well we just sedated this
silverback<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> find<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
silverback only to find out that it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
silverback only to find out that it
doesn't<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.200> match<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
doesn't it's not the right match so

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
doesn't it's not the right match so
again<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.060> looking<00:01:21.479> at<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.930> trying<00:01:22.229> to
