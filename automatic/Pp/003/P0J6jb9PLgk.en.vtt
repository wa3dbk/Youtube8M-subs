00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Ang's Auto Sport central so what we did

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.590 
Ang's Auto Sport central so what we did
is<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.820> went<00:00:50.910> ahead<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> drove<00:00:51.390> our<00:00:51.570> car

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
is we went ahead and drove our car

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.959 
is we went ahead and drove our car
around<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.170> 20<00:00:52.469> miles<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:53.190> no<00:00:53.520> heat<00:00:53.730> shield

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
around for 20 miles with no heat shield

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.950 
around for 20 miles with no heat shield
on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> bottom<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.690> we're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
on the bottom of so we're going to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
on the bottom of so we're going to
measure<00:00:55.170> our<00:00:55.469> temperature<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> outside

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
measure our temperature on the outside

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.680 
measure our temperature on the outside
of<00:00:56.550> our<00:00:56.610> hood<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> put<00:00:57.600> our

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
of our hood then we're going to put our

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.150 
of our hood then we're going to put our
heat<00:00:57.809> shield<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.379> another<00:00:58.649> drive<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
heat shield on make another drive and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.840 
heat shield on make another drive and
see<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> difference<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.699> now

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
see what the difference is so right now

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.550 
see what the difference is so right now
it's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.210> hundred<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.719> twenty-one<00:01:04.140> degrees

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's a hundred and twenty-one degrees

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's a hundred and twenty-one degrees
alright<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> first<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.189> we've<00:01:08.340> done

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
alright now the first thing we've done

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.010 
alright now the first thing we've done
is<00:01:08.640> we've<00:01:08.790> went<00:01:08.939> ahead<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.330> laid<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.600> our

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
is we've went ahead and laid out our

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
is we've went ahead and laid out our
lava<00:01:10.320> shield<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:10.890> heat<00:01:11.130> shield<00:01:11.340> products<00:01:11.700> on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
lava shield from heat shield products on

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
lava shield from heat shield products on
our<00:01:11.909> hood<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:12.810> we're<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
our hood what we're going to do now is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.810 
our hood what we're going to do now is
we're<00:01:13.950> basically<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> trim

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we're basically just going to trim

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
we're basically just going to trim
around<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.869> excess<00:01:16.619> pieces<00:01:16.860> off

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
around and get the excess pieces off

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
around and get the excess pieces off
that<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:18.090> need<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:18.840> ahead

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that we don't need and then we go ahead

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.140 
that we don't need and then we go ahead
and<00:01:19.259> apply<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> by<00:01:20.340> pulling<00:01:20.729> off<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> backing

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
and apply it by pulling off the backing

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
and apply it by pulling off the backing
now<00:01:24.150> remove<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> paper<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> adhesive

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
now remove the paper from the adhesive

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.749 
now remove the paper from the adhesive
so<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.979> stick<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> bottom<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
so you can stick it to the bottom of
