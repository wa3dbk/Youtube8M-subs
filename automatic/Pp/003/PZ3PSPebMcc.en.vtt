at<00:00:04.980> specialized<00:00:05.850> bikes<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.620> we're<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.740> to

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
at specialized bikes and we're here to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.759 
at specialized bikes and we're here to
talk<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.880> new<00:00:09.570> ebola<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.349> bikes<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.650> we

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
talk about a new ebola of bikes that we

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.330 
talk about a new ebola of bikes that we
have<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.580> 2011<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:13.440> particular<00:00:13.769> bike<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.309> a

compared<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> standard<00:01:13.140> stumpy<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.189> again

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
compared to a standard stumpy so again

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100 
compared to a standard stumpy so again
just<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.180> changes<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
just a lot of little changes like the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.310 
just a lot of little changes like the
chain<00:01:16.799> guide<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.400> double<00:01:18.090> shift<00:01:18.210> guide<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.689> few

chain guide the double shift guide a few

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
chain guide the double shift guide a few
changes<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.880> kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> bring<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> trail

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
changes that kind of bring out the trail

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
changes that kind of bring out the trail
aspects<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> stumpy<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.409> take<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
aspects of the stumpy and take it to the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
aspects of the stumpy and take it to the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to that next level this suspension

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.070 
to that next level this suspension
system<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:26.060> very<00:01:27.060> consistent<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.689> very

bikes<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> custom<00:01:32.610> shock

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
bikes here it's a it's a custom shock

from<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.930> fox<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.950> particular<00:01:35.280> yoke<00:01:35.549> piece

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
from from fox this particular yoke piece

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.620 
from from fox this particular yoke piece
bolts<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> special<00:01:37.460> body<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.270> shock

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
bolts on to a special body of the shock

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.710 
bolts on to a special body of the shock
and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.380> allows<00:01:41.009> them<00:01:41.220> allows<00:01:41.640> us<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and then allows them allows us to you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
and then allows them allows us to you
know<00:01:42.810> keep<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.110> nice<00:01:43.369> uninterrupted<00:01:44.369> seat<00:01:44.579> tube

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
know keep a nice uninterrupted seat tube

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.600 
know keep a nice uninterrupted seat tube
so<00:01:45.329> lots<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> sea<00:01:45.810> post<00:01:46.020> adjustment<00:01:46.610> nice

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so lots of sea post adjustment nice

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.270 
so lots of sea post adjustment nice

is<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.119> efficient<00:01:54.600> structure<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.200> most

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
is very efficient structure and most

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
is very efficient structure and most
