00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
which one this appears to be better to

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.589 
which one this appears to be better to
you<00:00:12.509> as<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:13.410> view<00:00:13.980> them<00:00:14.190> I'll<00:00:14.700> disclose<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.509> in

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
you as you view them I'll disclose it in

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.040 
you as you view them I'll disclose it in
a<00:00:15.660> moment<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.379> are

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
a moment what they are

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.840 
a moment what they are
they<00:00:19.050> both<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.439> will<00:00:19.710> retouched<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> face

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
they both had will retouched on the face

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
they both had will retouched on the face
equally<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> normally<00:00:22.020> cut<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.680> face

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
equally as I normally cut your face

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.089 
equally as I normally cut your face
so<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.090> equal<00:00:24.449> they<00:00:25.140> an<00:00:25.529> equal<00:00:25.859> amount

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
so this is equal they an equal amount

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
so this is equal they an equal amount
the<00:00:26.340> same<00:00:26.550> amount<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:27.119> retouching<00:00:29.210> on<00:00:30.210> each

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the same amount of retouching on each

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
the same amount of retouching on each
face<00:00:31.669> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.210> ring<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
face you can see here this ring is

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950 
face you can see here this ring is
sharper<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.520> softer<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.719> would<00:00:36.840> say

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
sharper this is softer now you would say

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
sharper this is softer now you would say
different<00:00:37.350> apertures<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.969> both

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
different apertures you know the both

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.010 
different apertures you know the both
shot<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.750> same<00:00:40.290> aperture<00:00:40.820> 2.8<00:00:41.840> one<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
shot at a same aperture 2.8 one is a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.150 
shot at a same aperture 2.8 one is a
$2,000<00:00:43.890> lens<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> $1000<00:00:45.809> lens<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
$2,000 lens was a $1000 lens with that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.420 
$2,000 lens was a $1000 lens with that
said<00:00:47.430> which<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> 2,000

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
said which one do you think is the 2,000

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.330 
said which one do you think is the 2,000
which<00:00:50.670> one's<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> $1000<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> click<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
which one's the $1000 when I click on it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.560 
which one's the $1000 when I click on it
it's<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.730> give<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> away<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.480> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
want to pause it and try to figure it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
want to pause it and try to figure it
out<00:00:56.010> before<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> click<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.780> should<00:00:57.840> do

it's the 100 millimeter macro this macro

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's the 100 millimeter macro this macro
is<00:01:35.790> known<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.240> being<00:01:36.390> sharp<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> way

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
is known for being sharp all the way

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.310 
is known for being sharp all the way
across<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.130> apertures<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.000> shot<00:01:39.780> both<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
across at all apertures a shot both of

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.069 
across at all apertures a shot both of
them<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.500> 2.8<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
them at 2.8 because well this can go to

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590 
them at 2.8 because well this can go to
1/2<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.460> only<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.640> 2<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> 8<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
1/2 this can only go 2 to 8 so how to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
1/2 this can only go 2 to 8 so how to
match<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.110> equally<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:49.049> focal<00:01:49.500> points<00:01:49.890> are

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
match it up equally the focal points are

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
match it up equally the focal points are
the<00:01:50.399> same<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.149> each<00:01:51.509> person<00:01:52.549> there<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.509> on

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
400 and this is 250 just because the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.649 
400 and this is 250 just because the
lens<00:02:04.170> allowed<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.180> peg<00:02:06.180> Dimitar<00:02:06.450> dead

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
lens allowed for the peg Dimitar dead

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.290 
lens allowed for the peg Dimitar dead
center<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.860> lens<00:02:08.099> allowed<00:02:08.970> for<00:02:09.270> that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
center and this lens allowed for that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.770 
center and this lens allowed for that
extra<00:02:09.750> style

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
extra style

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.080
