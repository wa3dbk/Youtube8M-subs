00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.550
 Berlin - again as a conductor Paavo matter with a worker in the 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.309
 Atom Ruins Rego ago is the Tour Final Kas 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.519
 Abu Dhabi year unfortunately could not be live with it 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.460
 Last Monday I think yesterday was live broadcast on ESL TV 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.339
 therefore abundant and now in place the finale 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.009
 and that was played out between the ex-herthanian Brett Okeke under his 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.640
 Counterparty percent for absolutely obscure so 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.100
 ple Germany against viruses 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.390
 only Russia as far as I know 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.470
 Best of Five for us the first map 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 Blistering why 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 "We definitely have one percent of excellent playing in the tournament 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.210
 Hard Rocks seen winds we could 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.720
 Persecute percent and watch that now eV one percent money too 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.160
 again in the final 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.310
 that we all wish for granted 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.950
 We have to settle for the first time, of course, thanks again to all of us 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.710
 It was really great and we have a lot of records again 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.470
 naked and we are now very close to it 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.460
 around 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.830
 the largest German airline 2 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.540
 To become Kostal Channel 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.970
 So finally many more subscribers and bean 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.630
 do we have 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.509
 Let's concentrate first 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.090
 also be seen game so also series is already strongest so early 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.710
 So has his troop parked untouched by Gauck's 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.160
 the first one causes 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.620
 Percent of its fast gas producer pulling up its Rex 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.740
 Goal 7 8 percent more action because of a fast factory 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.530
 and we are surprised by the croupier 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.390
 that was a banter reading her upside down 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.550
 and now not percent 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.550
 it's that easy to do without Accell 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670
 also want to be 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.650
 and 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.770
 HasuObs 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.190
 plays Dirk Meyer 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.370
 the customers are not 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.520
 favorable 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.560
 variant 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.520
 Percent uses so glad first 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.139
 Bruce exclusively on the Nexus One the rally on it finally 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.879
 very important as it was before heavy traffic 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.299
 the value of the putting had first the second guest 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.739
 how far are we there party cashes in turn on his part 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.960
 routinely and 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.119
 who will be here now? 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.249
 the parents knew how to make a low-level flight out of the dust 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:33.139
 so we are curious so faster than Bern's dax-curve Cibeles standards 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.460
 but discotheque ad hoc Lobau eye tooth to tooth 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.810
 but who but who has so if they bought the gas 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.379
 so we can go this question is on the way despite some sat down with 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.939
 Dr 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.289
 Percent becomes first celebrity 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.299
 Rob Blake Scepter does not do it's first - on the way moreover 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.549
 lived 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.670
 will try here now you know that the nature lovers 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.779
 Grothaus Sports to liberate 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.049
 Valverde has been raped and 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.509
 the first inhabitant 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.879
 well here's how i'm gorgeous with his percent 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.879
 Tel 77 mm small 4 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.959
 at the recent meeting and then four paws challenges complex Â«really good 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:16.769
 imagine" 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.859
 definitely 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.939
 lol a good idea against Stoke 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.230
 yes we are here a little peculiarity was in percent 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.640
 we see that now a possible reason is a leak is pumped so it 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.880
 more or less the slippery river is 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.140
 but that is usually still dry, but it also permeates the doctors 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.859
 Blackdome or another tenant 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.229
 Percentage points 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.400
 No first at the wall and serves Belfast 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.530
 big chains like 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.759
 Brigit the side stages Stephan Gerster high and 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.020
 that will be natural 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.020
 and formerly the spirit of Ex Laden will unfortunately be the one 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.049
 it gets cold again Wormsdorf the reptiles 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.260
 to the back of the head and fair story of our crumbles into its items 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.879
 is virtually the materialized and 4 because you can not do much in between 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.180
 suggest free-to-play advances we just wanted to build around here 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.180
 the more comfortable to secure ergo 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.499
 Gabor Boczko was rarely to occupy today 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.889
 it will continue 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.900
 Bern may be the best one 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.840
 HasuObs 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.389
 pressure now 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.419
 you already put three in the direction of earth Manuel first but the two 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.270
 Euro but here 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.139
 if at the start of classic though not responsible for that nevertheless one 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:31.590
 chance 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 to get away with life places balcony checkout notes become becomes festive 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.580
 and Raser Ops he builds her 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.599
 they are 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.059
 the more or less days of life thus the facial expressions Kurztrips open wen under us 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:44.849
 see where that leads 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.230
 in the direction of Borken parts of Iran its Rostock was produced 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.070
 With that, we missed our sales target and Ice Slipper died 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.849
 under 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.490
 climb 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.139
 have joints satires 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.930
 after all, it's not at all possible 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.520
 but during the bunker 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.949
 for the first time, this worries 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.300
 16 is Geoff Turk is blessed 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.229
 so that comes the reactor is on 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.749
 at the second at Rex and the troop the KVB already 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.720
 Insecurity is the best club vigorously redesigned 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.240
 The word had to speak every moment I say yes with three 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.129
 fresh wind 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.689
 and then the light will turn 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.280
 is in the direction of Franck Ribery 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.599
 but where it is then 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.639
 most likely 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.300
 can not do so much damage 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.650
 At least the companions are embarrassed from how big the mothers and will be 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.289
 you and we have Munich - the course Sonderburg de 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.289
 it's pretty quick to flex from the sky 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:42.940
 from the 5 flex 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.490
 there say that times 10 times because you can and then we pass on 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.599
 I like Janine Composition 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.189
 makes the 4th 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:53.589
 7 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:54.669
 Sharp to say
