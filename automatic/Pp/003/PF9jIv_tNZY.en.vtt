00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.859 
sitting next to the stove just crying so
I<00:01:42.060> glanced<00:01:43.060> at<00:01:43.179> it<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.539> that's<00:01:43.599> when<00:01:43.840> I

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
I glanced at it and that's when I

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.980 
I glanced at it and that's when I
noticed<00:01:44.319> the<00:01:44.560> burner<00:01:45.220> on<00:01:45.550> no<00:01:46.390> flames<00:01:46.750> no

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
noticed the burner on no flames no

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.680 
noticed the burner on no flames no
nothing<00:01:47.319> just<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.920> gas<00:01:48.130> coming<00:01:48.490> out<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:49.060> was

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
nothing just the gas coming out I was

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.660 
nothing just the gas coming out I was
fighting<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.080> cold<00:01:50.319> really<00:01:50.979> couldn't<00:01:51.340> smell

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
fighting a cold really couldn't smell

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.910 
fighting a cold really couldn't smell
much<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.030> was<00:01:52.149> I'm<00:01:52.300> very<00:01:52.330> very<00:01:53.200> low<00:01:53.470> -<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.830> was

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
much it was I'm very very low - it was

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.830 
much it was I'm very very low - it was

the lowest settings I believe that's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.260 
the lowest settings I believe that's
maybe<00:01:56.140> why<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.440> went<00:01:56.649> out<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.520> was<00:01:57.670> probably<00:01:58.060> on

maybe why it went out it was probably on

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.419
