there<00:00:57.240> you<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.420> ok<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.260> take<00:00:58.380> those<00:00:58.500> out

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
there you go ok so you take those out

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.299 
there you go ok so you take those out
the<00:00:59.700> rubber<00:01:00.620> cover<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:03.049> just<00:01:04.049> goes<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the rubber cover here just goes on like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.219 
the rubber cover here just goes on like
this<00:01:05.609> and<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.350> pull<00:01:07.649> there's<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.070> there's<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
this and you pull there's a there's a

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.889 
this and you pull there's a there's a
lip<00:01:10.229> back<00:01:10.469> here<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.249> then<00:01:11.999> right<00:01:12.749> in<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
lip back here and then right in the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.410 
lip back here and then right in the
center<00:01:13.560> back<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.859> think<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.210> pops

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
center back I think and it just pops

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.849 
center back I think and it just pops
open<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.079> then<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
open like that and then you can take it

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.859 
open like that and then you can take it
off<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.210> shouldn't<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.689> too<00:01:18.780> much

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
off so that shouldn't be too much

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.179 
off so that shouldn't be too much
trouble<00:01:18.929> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.069> just<00:01:20.249> the<00:01:20.369> emergency<00:01:20.789> lock

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
trouble this is just the emergency lock

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.099 
trouble this is just the emergency lock
now<00:01:23.189> here's<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> reason<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.600> cause<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
now here's the reason the cause of the

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.870 
now here's the reason the cause of the
problem<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:26.219> then<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:28.229> workaround<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.069> then

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
problem and then the workaround and then

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
problem and then the workaround and then
what<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.149> much<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.079> actually

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
what how much it would be to actually

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.760 
what how much it would be to actually
replace<00:01:32.429> this<00:01:32.639> whole<00:01:32.789> thing<00:01:32.999> so<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.530> cause<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
replace this whole thing so the cause of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.849 
replace this whole thing so the cause of
the<00:01:34.950> problem<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> focus<00:01:39.469> this<00:01:40.469> piece

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
the problem is there to focus this piece

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.620 
the problem is there to focus this piece
it<00:01:41.369> might<00:01:41.639> be<00:01:41.729> hard<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> see<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.389> it's<00:01:42.600> a

it might be hard to see here but it's a
black<00:01:42.840> rotary<00:01:43.109> piece<00:01:44.719> for<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:45.810> electronic

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.590 

the<00:01:49.619> problem<00:01:50.039> is<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.759> black<00:01:50.999> rotary<00:01:51.209> piece

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the problem is this black rotary piece

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.539 
the problem is this black rotary piece
is<00:01:52.069> getting<00:01:53.069> stuck<00:01:53.459> like<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.539> here<00:01:55.549> this

is getting stuck like you see here this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.840 
is getting stuck like you see here this
piece<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:58.590> arm<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.579> actually

piece right here this arm is actually

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.929 
piece right here this arm is actually
what<00:01:59.939> unlocks<00:02:00.359> the<00:02:01.350> lock<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.799> week<00:02:02.729> I'm

that black rotary piece so what I did in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.270 
that black rotary piece so what I did in
order<00:02:46.090> for<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.480> return<00:02:46.810> back<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.860> normal

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
order for it to return back to normal

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.890 
order for it to return back to normal
and<00:02:48.459> by<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.670> way<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.970> reason<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.750> root

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
and by the way the reason and the root

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.180 
and by the way the reason and the root
cause<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.140> why<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.500> not<00:02:50.680> returning<00:02:51.069> back

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
cause of why is not returning back

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.660 
cause of why is not returning back
normal

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
normal

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.220 
normal
probably<00:02:52.239> because<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.480> tension<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.049> just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
probably because the tension is just

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.400 
probably because the tension is just
very<00:02:53.440> very<00:02:53.650> low<00:02:54.040> because<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.579> use<00:02:54.790> about

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
very very low because of use about

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.979 
very very low because of use about
125,000<00:02:56.410> miles<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.769> car<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:58.780> wears

125,000 miles on this car and just wears

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.660 
125,000 miles on this car and just wears
out<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.470> haven't<00:03:00.040> opened<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.519> look

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
out I haven't opened this up to look

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.069 
out I haven't opened this up to look
into<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.090> don't<00:03:01.299> care<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> much<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:02.019> it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
into it I don't care that much about it

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.619 
into it I don't care that much about it
I<00:03:02.349> just<00:03:02.620> wanted<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.920> work<00:03:02.980> around<00:03:03.129> so<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:04.599> I

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
I just wanted to work around so what I

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.530 
I just wanted to work around so what I
did<00:03:04.720> was<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.530> shaved<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.370> off<00:03:06.670> quite<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> bit

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
did was I shaved this off quite a bit

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.490 
did was I shaved this off quite a bit
and<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.799> allowed<00:03:09.069> me<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.609> is<00:03:10.500> now

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
and what that allowed me to do is now

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.460 
and what that allowed me to do is now
I'm<00:03:11.680> going<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.889> actuate<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.470> driver

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I'm going to actuate the the driver

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.670 
I'm going to actuate the the driver
trunk<00:03:15.310> release<00:03:15.609> all<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.540> does<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.840> pull<00:03:17.500> this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
trunk release all it does is pull this

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.410 
trunk release all it does is pull this
and<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.670> there's<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.910> key<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:21.150> doing<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.209> key

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
and so there's the key so doing the key

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
and so there's the key so doing the key
or<00:03:22.690> doing<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.930> trunk<00:03:23.109> release<00:03:23.260> does<00:03:23.799> this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
or doing the trunk release does this

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.780 
or doing the trunk release does this
action<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.670> look<00:03:25.600> what<00:03:25.780> happens<00:03:26.200> here<00:03:26.290> a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
action and look what happens here a

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.759 
action and look what happens here a
couple<00:03:27.790> times<00:03:30.450> they're<00:03:31.450> black<00:03:32.200> actuators

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
couple times they're black actuators

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.839 
couple times they're black actuators
went<00:03:33.010> back<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:34.290> now<00:03:35.400> your<00:03:36.400> trunk<00:03:36.670> should

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
went back and now your trunk should

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.270 
went back and now your trunk should
close<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.569> with<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.889> make<00:03:42.040> sure<00:03:42.220> that

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
close so with this just make sure that

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.470 
close so with this just make sure that
if<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.609> use<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:44.700> under<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.880> hood<00:03:46.060> under<00:03:46.239> the

if you use this under the hood under the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.569 
if you use this under the hood under the
trunk<00:03:49.230> opener<00:03:50.230> which<00:03:50.709> activates<00:03:51.160> electronic

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
trunk opener which activates electronic

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.539 
trunk opener which activates electronic
portion<00:03:52.000> or<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.660> use<00:03:52.780> your<00:03:52.959> key<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.950> open<00:03:54.310> it

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
which is again electronic it's going to

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.379 
which is again electronic it's going to
activate<00:03:56.919> that<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:57.370> get<00:03:57.489> stuck<00:03:57.790> again<00:03:57.940> but

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
activate that as we get stuck again but

parts you know several times and it goes

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.150 
parts you know several times and it goes
back<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.940> normal<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.380> price<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.860> replace

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
back to normal so the price to replace

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160 
back to normal so the price to replace
this<00:04:17.310> whole<00:04:17.459> thing<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:18.510> part<00:04:18.750> itself<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.140> a

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.320 
dealer only part and it goes for 280 ish
and<00:04:24.060> then<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.360> was<00:04:24.480> quoted<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:25.200> three<00:04:25.640> 315<00:04:26.640> 322

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and then I was quoted like three 315 322

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.440 
and then I was quoted like three 315 322
you<00:04:27.780> know<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.080> them<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.260> install<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:29.450> that

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450

that's parts on labor I didn't want to
pay<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.570> figured<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.080> out<00:04:34.640> and
