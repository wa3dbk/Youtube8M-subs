is<00:01:27.000> saying<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.990> having

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
is saying that it's going to be having

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.830 
is saying that it's going to be having
lower<00:01:28.530> speed<00:01:29.119> along<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.390> said<00:01:30.630> higher

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
lower speed along like I said higher

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
lower speed along like I said higher
special<00:01:31.259> attack<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> higher<00:01:32.130> defense<00:01:32.880> which

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
special attack and higher defense which

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.260 
special attack and higher defense which
is<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:35.040> isn't<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.790> exact

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
is pretty good that isn't an exact

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
is pretty good that isn't an exact
number<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> stats<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> be

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
number of what it stats are going to be

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.950 
number of what it stats are going to be
like<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> did<00:01:39.240> come<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> little

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
like but I did come up with a little

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.780 
like but I did come up with a little
stat<00:01:40.500> spread<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> give<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
stat spread right here so i can give you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
stat spread right here so i can give you
guys<00:01:42.000> an<00:01:42.150> idea<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.540> i<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.229> be

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
guys an idea what i think is going to be

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.440 
guys an idea what i think is going to be
because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.979> only<00:01:44.100> makes<00:01:44.310> sense<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
because it only makes sense to have the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.870 
because it only makes sense to have the
stats<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:47.040> opinion<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.759> i'm

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
stats in this way in my opinion so i'm

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.950 
stats in this way in my opinion so i'm
thinking<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.210> good<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.479> retaining<00:01:48.780> its

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
thinking is good to be retaining its

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
thinking is good to be retaining its
base<00:01:49.110> HP<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.130> McGee<00:01:50.460> volvo's<00:01:50.909> have

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
base HP because all McGee volvo's have

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.550 
base HP because all McGee volvo's have
retained<00:01:51.360> their<00:01:51.509> base<00:01:51.659> HP<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.320> probably

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
retained their base HP so is probably

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990 
retained their base HP so is probably
going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> stay<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.040> 50<00:01:53.399> which<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
going to stay have 50 which is kind of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.440 
going to stay have 50 which is kind of
low<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.350> having<00:01:55.759> 85<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:57.030> hack<00:01:57.270> i

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
low it's going to be having 85 as hack i

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.749 
low it's going to be having 85 as hack i
do<00:01:57.540> believe<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> be

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
do believe i think it's not going to be

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.039 
do believe i think it's not going to be
getting<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.000> humid<00:02:00.270> attack<00:02:00.509> increase<00:02:00.869> when<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
getting a humid attack increase when I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:01.690 
getting a humid attack increase when I
only<00:02:01.170> gave

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
only gave

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.789 
only gave
all<00:02:01.789> 10<00:02:02.030> increase<00:02:02.600> in<00:02:02.630> its<00:02:02.899> attack<00:02:03.170> its

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
all 10 increase in its attack its

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.779 
all 10 increase in its attack its
defense<00:02:04.159> i<00:02:04.280> think<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:04.549> going<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.729> be

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
defense i think it's going to be

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.749 
defense i think it's going to be
shooting<00:02:05.000> up<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.420> 125<00:02:06.380> i<00:02:06.829> do<00:02:07.130> believe<00:02:07.430> that's

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
shooting up to 125 i do believe that's

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.449 
shooting up to 125 i do believe that's
more<00:02:08.149> logical<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.590> because<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.369> going

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
more logical to have because it's going

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.670 
more logical to have because it's going
to<00:02:10.519> be<00:02:10.640> having<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.269> giant<00:02:11.989> jewel<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.470> front<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
to be having a giant jewel in front of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.040 
to be having a giant jewel in front of
its<00:02:12.800> body<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.250> jewels<00:02:13.970> are<00:02:14.090> hard<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.900> I'm

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
its body and jewels are hard so I'm

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.330 
its body and jewels are hard so I'm
assuming<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.530> gonna<00:02:15.680> get<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.830> large<00:02:16.069> difference

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
assuming is gonna get a large difference

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.009 
assuming is gonna get a large difference
increase<00:02:16.849> also<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:17.450> that's<00:02:17.629> why<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.750> think<00:02:17.840> it's

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
increase also so that's why I think it's

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.380 
increase also so that's why I think it's
idiot<00:02:18.290> ahead<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.530> 25<00:02:18.950> which<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.580> pretty<00:02:20.060> pretty

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
idiot ahead in 25 which is pretty pretty

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720 
idiot ahead in 25 which is pretty pretty
good<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:20.780> my<00:02:20.900> opinion<00:02:21.099> it's<00:02:22.099> special<00:02:22.489> attack

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
good in my opinion it's special attack

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.120 
good in my opinion it's special attack
I'm<00:02:22.910> assuming<00:02:23.269> it's<00:02:23.330> going<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.599> be<00:02:23.690> 115<00:02:24.500> that's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
I'm assuming it's going to be 115 that's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.470 
I'm assuming it's going to be 115 that's
pretty<00:02:25.310> high<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.880> does<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.330> lot<00:02:26.450> of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
pretty high it does have a lot of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.789 
pretty high it does have a lot of
special<00:02:26.810> attacks<00:02:27.080> too<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.650> really

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
special attacks too so it can really

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.830 
special attacks too so it can really
utilize<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.280> also<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.090> plus<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.690> learns

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
utilize that also and plus it learns

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.210 
utilize that also and plus it learns
moves<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.230> all<00:02:30.410> mines<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.769> it'd<00:02:31.010> be<00:02:31.040> pretty

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
moves like all mines that it'd be pretty

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.369 
moves like all mines that it'd be pretty
good<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.849> have<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.330> high<00:02:32.569> special<00:02:32.989> attacking

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
good to have with high special attacking

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.259 
good to have with high special attacking
stats<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:34.400> special<00:02:34.730> defense<00:02:34.940> I'm<00:02:35.120> only

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
stats it's special defense I'm only

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.300 
stats it's special defense I'm only
leaving<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.690> at<00:02:35.870> 85<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.799> don't<00:02:36.980> think<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.220> good

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
leaving it at 85 I don't think it's good

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400 
leaving it at 85 I don't think it's good
to<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:37.400> increasing<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.030> much<00:02:38.269> most<00:02:39.140> things

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
to be increasing that much most things

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.530 
to be increasing that much most things
that<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:39.709> hard<00:02:39.950> bodies<00:02:40.340> don't<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:41.090> really

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that have hard bodies don't have really

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.420 
that have hard bodies don't have really
good<00:02:41.720> special<00:02:42.110> defense<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:43.040> assuming

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
good special defense and I'm assuming

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.380 
good special defense and I'm assuming
that<00:02:43.549> that<00:02:43.579> jewel<00:02:43.849> is<00:02:44.030> not<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.299> be

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
that that jewel is not going to be

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.670 
that that jewel is not going to be
increasing<00:02:44.750> its<00:02:44.870> special<00:02:45.110> events<00:02:45.349> that<00:02:45.470> well

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
increasing its special events that well

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.710 
increasing its special events that well
so<00:02:46.130> i'm<00:02:46.190> only<00:02:46.340> giving<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.790> 20<00:02:47.120> base<00:02:47.329> that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
so i'm only giving it a 20 base that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.319 
so i'm only giving it a 20 base that
increase<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:48.950> its<00:02:49.160> defense<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.760> i'm<00:02:50.180> assuming

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
increase in its defense and i'm assuming

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.699 
increase in its defense and i'm assuming
that<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.019> speed<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.620> be

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
that if the speed is going to be

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.370 
that if the speed is going to be
decreasing<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.519> about<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:53.030> 20<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:54.110> reason

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
decreasing to about these 20 the reason

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.470 
decreasing to about these 20 the reason
why<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.560> because<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:55.340> jewel<00:02:55.819> is<00:02:56.000> big<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
why is because that jewel is big and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
why is because that jewel is big and
just<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:58.519> outstanding<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.660> huge<00:02:59.900> so

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
just just just outstanding it's huge so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.289 
just just just outstanding it's huge so
i'm<00:03:00.590> assuming<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:01.160> its<00:03:01.340> speed<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:02.120> going

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
i'm assuming that its speed is not going

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.750 
i'm assuming that its speed is not going
to<00:03:02.360> be<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.510> fast<00:03:02.959> after<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> fact<00:03:03.799> so<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.310> low

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
to be that fast after the fact so a low

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.120 
to be that fast after the fact so a low
base<00:03:05.000> 20<00:03:05.420> seems<00:03:05.660> more<00:03:05.959> applicable<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.799> i

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
base 20 seems more applicable and i

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.699 
base 20 seems more applicable and i
think<00:03:07.609> that's<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.150> pretty<00:03:08.690> reasonable<00:03:08.989> stats

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
think that's a pretty reasonable stats

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.289 
think that's a pretty reasonable stats
pret<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.040> don't<00:03:10.280> think<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.519> too<00:03:10.670> much<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:11.150> don't

overpowered<00:03:14.209> it's<00:03:14.870> reasonable<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.709> plus

with<00:03:16.160> magic<00:03:16.489> balance<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:17.000> something

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
with magic balance this is something

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.360 
with magic balance this is something
that's<00:03:17.329> also<00:03:17.660> usable<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.560> it's<00:03:18.709> not<00:03:18.859> horribly

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370

some<00:03:45.700> information<00:03:46.269> about<00:03:46.299> stabilize<00:03:46.840> I

some information about stabilize I

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.479 
some information about stabilize I
should<00:03:47.140> think<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:48.010> going<00:03:48.189> to<00:03:48.310> be

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
should think that it's going to be

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.130 
should think that it's going to be
having<00:03:48.939> like<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.299> know<00:03:49.480> do<00:03:49.689> you<00:03:49.780> think<00:03:49.989> it's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
having like you know do you think it's

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.390 
having like you know do you think it's
going<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.319> be<00:03:50.379> getting<00:03:50.590> some<00:03:50.739> new<00:03:50.829> moves<00:03:51.069> or

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400

something<00:03:51.700> in<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:51.879> game<00:03:52.090> or<00:03:52.510> do<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:52.959> think

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
something in this game or do you think

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.470 
something in this game or do you think
that<00:03:53.409> it's<00:03:53.950> that's<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.519> completely<00:03:55.120> different

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
that it's that's a completely different
