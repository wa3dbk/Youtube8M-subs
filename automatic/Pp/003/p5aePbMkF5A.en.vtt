00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.810
 good in this kind of accompaniment to 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.350
 sing let's go 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.670
 to sing I will sing a separate part 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.970
 because the series are divided 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 in four parts or four blocks but 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.520
 that musically once we learn 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 one normally all are equal what 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.580
 varies that the lyrics or the dance but in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.590
 this case the guitar was always going to 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.850
 say that we're going to do a class about 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 the Sevillian complement and although the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.960
 flamencos do not consider that the Sevillian 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.150
 to the rumba or 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 According to what others 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.700
 types of touches do not consider them sticks 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 to the flamencos I think that to us 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.630
 yes that interests us and is interesting because 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 so let's do what ever 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.420
 we are going to play chords of is a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.440
 Sevillian that is made in major tone and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 I'm going to touch the entrance to be and we're going to 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.860
 go to the child I will make a contribution of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.860
 He passed 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.160
 as if we put a seventh do but what 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.160
 we raise up to 3 is a chord 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.380
 that goes in search of the sun and then here 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.380
 we will do a seventh 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.910
 and the minute and then we'll go through the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.400
 doping it seems to me that there is no longer 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.050
 but otherwise we are going to 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.330
 look at the jobs explained that the 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.330
 wounds are worn for so long seconds 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.760
 and that there is a time when guitar 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.720
 after making an entry then leave 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.480
 to sound but the cantaor or the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.540
 singers being can already be 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.020
 sevillanas more flamencas only blind 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.450
 ok the singers are still wearing a 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.790
 compa to see even if the guitar is 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.920
 motivated 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.060
 then put the example right I'm going to 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.060
 start and let's do it like this 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.720
 I'm from Sevilla 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.720
 I'm sevilla 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.190
 I am Sevillian, tiles and seeds 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.849
 I am Sevillian 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.849
 hunting seville I am love 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.990
 I'm from la macarena 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:10.080
 the most beautiful neighborhood in my way 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:16.070
 the world live the life 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.070
 the penalty 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.980
 Good to tell you that when you enter 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.370
 when he makes this entry, it's worth the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.370
 example 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.040
 I am from Seville , Seville 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.430
 means you have to take to have 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.470
 in mind of singing to compass so that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.730
 then the guitar and the cante 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.720
 between 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.370
 unison at the same time good let's do what 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.480
 I'm always going to do a little 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.069
 entry 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.420
 I will continue capturing and then 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.890
 I will simply accompany you with touches 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.769
 on the guitar to carry the compass 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.450
 come on let's go there and put yourselves 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.340
 I'm going to make the guitar a little bit 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.110
 slower maybe it's worth for those who 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.110
 have a little less than level 1 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:33.180
 and I am from Seville I am Sevillian I am 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:39.280
 Sevillian who has been seville I am 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:46.780
 Sevillian capturing is called I am the 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:52.240
 love of life I am macareno I am from the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:05:01.270
 macarena I am macareno the neighborhood more 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 nice of the whole world and mine kills me 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:12.810
 the most beautiful in the world makes me so 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.810
 just by looking at the track it's worth it 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.460
 well then 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.250
 and fixing them to the chords and try 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.289
 change without losing the compass and not lose 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.900
 the rhythm if at some point you have to 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:30.039
 do strange things because you have 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:34.470
 wrong so nothing will I prepare 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:37.280
 another class and we're leaving it like this 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.280
 by one
