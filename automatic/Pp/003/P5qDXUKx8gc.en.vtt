evenly matched thus far

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.589 
evenly matched thus far
the<00:03:35.620> one<00:03:35.829> difference<00:03:36.129> yeah<00:03:37.060> they're<00:03:37.269> evenly

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
the one difference yeah they're evenly

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.000 
the one difference yeah they're evenly
matched<00:03:37.750> physically<00:03:38.439> no<00:03:38.590> question<00:03:38.950> about

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
matched physically no question about

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.789 
matched physically no question about
that<00:03:39.189> but<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.090> weight<00:03:40.329> edge<00:03:40.629> that<00:03:40.900> ODB<00:03:41.319> has<00:03:41.560> as

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
that but the weight edge that ODB has as

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.160 
that but the weight edge that ODB has as
well<00:03:42.010> as<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.670> experience<00:03:43.389> advantage<00:03:43.719> at<00:03:44.049> the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
well as the experience advantage at the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.259 
well as the experience advantage at the
same<00:03:44.379> time<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.370> think<00:03:45.579> those<00:03:45.760> factors

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
same time and I think those factors

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.229 
same time and I think those factors
could<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.989> huge<00:03:47.439> in<00:03:47.889> terms<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.430> deciding<00:03:48.790> this

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
could be huge in terms of deciding this

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.720 
could be huge in terms of deciding this
matchup<00:03:49.590> during<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.680> break<00:03:50.889> Brittany<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
matchup during the break Brittany the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.849 
matchup during the break Brittany the
nice<00:03:51.909> series<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> nice<00:03:52.780> flurry<00:03:53.109> of<00:03:53.200> offense<00:03:53.349> and

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
nice series a nice flurry of offense and

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.890 
nice series a nice flurry of offense and
there<00:03:54.040> saw<00:03:54.669> the<00:03:54.730> ability<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.299> avoid<00:03:55.689> the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
there saw the ability to avoid the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.020 
there saw the ability to avoid the
contact<00:03:56.409> in<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.620> corner<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.700> well

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
contact in the corner and that well

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.379 
contact in the corner and that well
scouted<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.650> now<00:03:59.909> Brittany<00:04:00.909> shown<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> little

bit nervous an aggressive side as things

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.569 
bit nervous an aggressive side as things
are<00:04:06.730> going<00:04:07.389> up<00:04:07.689> a<00:04:07.870> level<00:04:08.200> obviously<00:04:09.069> on<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
are going up a level obviously on the

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.610 
are going up a level obviously on the
physicality<00:04:10.150> between<00:04:10.750> these<00:04:10.930> two<00:04:11.139> knockouts

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
physicality between these two knockouts

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.159 
physicality between these two knockouts
ODB<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.579> gritty<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.269> look<00:04:13.450> at<00:04:13.569> that<00:04:13.689> a<00:04:13.720> head

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
ODB and gritty and look at that a head

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.180 
ODB and gritty and look at that a head
fuck<00:04:15.630> well<00:04:16.630> just<00:04:16.840> blew<00:04:17.199> my<00:04:17.349> theory<00:04:17.769> about<00:04:17.859> how

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
fuck well just blew my theory about how

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.379 
fuck well just blew my theory about how
OD<00:04:18.609> beam<00:04:18.820> is<00:04:18.970> going<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.180> bring<00:04:19.299> the

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
OD beam is going to bring the

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.529 
OD beam is going to bring the
physicality<00:04:19.810> right<00:04:20.849> just<00:04:21.849> like<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.240> look<00:04:22.419> at

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
physicality right just like that look at

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.950 
physicality right just like that look at
that<00:04:22.659> handspring<00:04:23.349> elbow<00:04:24.360> from<00:04:25.360> Brittany<00:04:25.750> all

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
that handspring elbow from Brittany all

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.899 
that handspring elbow from Brittany all
kinds<00:04:26.530> of<00:04:26.620> momentum<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.039> handspring<00:04:27.639> brings

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
kinds of momentum that handspring brings

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.629 
kinds of momentum that handspring brings
you<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.389> much<00:04:28.630> momentum<00:04:29.500> going<00:04:29.979> in<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.370> corner

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
you so much momentum going in the corner

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.149 
you so much momentum going in the corner
now<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.690> count<00:04:31.930> does<00:04:32.169> not<00:04:32.409> connect<00:04:32.889> with<00:04:32.949> the

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
now to count does not connect with the

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.600 
now to count does not connect with the
three<00:04:33.990> certainly<00:04:34.990> very<00:04:35.260> close<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.949> very<00:04:35.979> very

three certainly very close and very very

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.310 
three certainly very close and very very
