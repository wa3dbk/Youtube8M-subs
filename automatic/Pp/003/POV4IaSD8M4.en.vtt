00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.760
 jules rimet of French origin 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.470
 who created the opportunity for football teams to compete 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.670
 each other to win a prize that would be the cup jules rimet 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.430
 It was a solid gold angel weighing three or five kilos 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.890

 in the first time Argentina was winning 2 to 0 but the Uruguayans were 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:33.389
