00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.830
 just to talk about a new 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.350
 concept that could surely happen 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.770
 on gta 5 online in a future dlc 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.050
 so surely the dlc the crime pays off 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.599
 number 2 so it's just for 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.250

 will show you an image on the screen 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.110
 so this is an image that has been realized 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.129
 by jane so I do not know how he 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.420

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.040
 realized other vehicles like 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.290
 this one of other convertible 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.489
 forgiveness such as adhere or zenn

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.130
 are and rusty or whatever 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.289
