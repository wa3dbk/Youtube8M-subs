 All this is written size accordingly 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.609
 I want to share my experience with you 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.220
 using this shoe 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.849
 I bought all this for this company 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 two pairs 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:32.760
 This is a marshmallow and the second model is a course 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.410
 bought in the store trial sport at a discount 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.470
 I was attracted by the price 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.260
 this you reviews the fact that the country 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.810
 punch maker German word 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.440

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.770
 they are very made this model 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.220
 its advantages in what is the appearance here 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.580
 of course membrane membrane gorteks 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.940
 here here is leather goes textiles textiles on 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.009
 this loop then there is a very good 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.929
 retainer lanyards that allow 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.159
 very tightly lace up if someone 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:14.500
 of course you need a shoe and thus 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.939
 ensure stability in the shin comfortable 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.109
 tongue to these shoes 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.289
 They wear soft light's leg 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:27.119
 they do not sweat walked even with minus oh 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.679
 at plus 20 degrees in them basically 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.310
 if the leg even wove them enough 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.280
 quickly all this diaper rash from the boot 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.729
 come out of the bill with of course 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.729
 gorteks and here is the tongue soft here before 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.149
 there were boots just ordinary boots with 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.569
 fur 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.569
 when to go oval respectively leg 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:54.159
 sweated when my foot was completely cold 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:58.810
 froze was still such a moment that here 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.869
 my ankle was rubbing the lining of 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.609
 meha was afraid that there would be 0 principle after 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.010
 this was never the shoes 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.160
 at all 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.670
 and so decided to buy these and others it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.070
 code when she went to me all the concerns 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.290
 disappeared because despite the fact that 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.490
 not enough like last with sneakers 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.650
 which gives you worn lately in 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.300
 ck tall here is a boot 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.140
 nothing ruined me they went to bed 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.580
 comfortable comfortably in general they have one 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.670
 advantages both in convenience and in sensations 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.380
 on the leg that is comfortable and have minuses 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.580
 Of course, too, there is a hard sole 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 vibram 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.490
 I watched reviews of one wonderful 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.880
 tourist this day from fractions he once 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.230
 also talked about shoes on a pillow 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.230
 vibram your first 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.950
 and said the sole is slippery 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.930
 that the sole is tough i naturally 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.850
 thought but who knows his may 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.080
 feeling as if I did not trust 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.180
 bought a man looked and you know that I 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.190
 I always wore these shoes only 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.780
 dry weather dry weather everything is fine 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.770
 by the way here is such an interesting protector 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.420
 part with what we do with 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.600
 deep slits it would seem 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.760
 you can walk and walk here but in fact in 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.040
 dry weather everything is fine the only thing 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.400
 rigidly very sole washing by the way 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.140
 special of 2 boot pulled 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.110
 It looks here and so it is very thinly 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.420
 really no depreciation in it 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.070
 basically no further here here if 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.690
 see here it is without washing that hand 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.140
 when you touch it but the sole 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.290
 really tough and that's how it is 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.459
 says denis fractions are very good for 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.200
 hiking on the rocks 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.600
 basically didnâ€™t go over stones 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 I wanted them to be in the Crimea in Sevastopol 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:10.350
 there are many places where there is a secant 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:13.709
 pebbles but I also went out in these shoes 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.950
 once in the rain and was very surprised that 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.290
 the city on the pavement they need me 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.960
 tells u felt that 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.380
 adhesion to which I am 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.530
 going 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.830
 but not sure if there is such 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.450
 somehow abruptly tried to accelerate 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.340
 go over there and row try 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.590
 I think it will become possible even 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.900
 fall they just go in slip 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.180
 I did not like this very much 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.960
 Here's a plus for everything I still have 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.060
 wide foot for these shoes 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.090
 in size they are below our 43 size 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.660
 it says here that size is 43 seconds 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.000
 by half 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.390
 Here I took it with a small margin 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.180
 in order for me to wear socks 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.340
 trekking or winter so that in winter 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.620
 freeze so here see it turns out that 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.810
 I have a foot here a little bit 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.750
 quite wider there is literally a millimeter than 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.020
 this block of it is not at first it is not 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.610
 noticed but then literally here is a goat 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.530
 especially walked wet to wet 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.290
 the weather here so they became 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.940
 decent straight so push on a finger they 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.780
 did not rub well yes it was the form 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.640
 unpleasant at me decided their course borsch 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.760
 they don't use them now the group wants 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.980
 buy in general for all who are interested 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.800
 This model is perfect and common 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:38.250
 I think for such a dry dusty area 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.650
 because here I went here I live myself 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.750
 Bastrykin Astrakhan region 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.490
 dust it is generally imperceptible to them that is 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.170
 rubs himself to have them interesting yet 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.010
 impregnation of the very beginning goes but I think 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.750
 so on all boots with a membrane when 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.520
 moisture gets in she won't even linger 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.320
 just rolls off principle not even 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.730
 speedy ported rag I still 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.950
 for now it's all fine I think 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.750
 which will last for some time unequivocally 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.030
 that is, if you are watering in a puddle 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.370
 just move away from the boot and he also does not 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.560
 it always gets dirty clean pack of 100 km 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.350
 from the sole of the foot here rubbed and once 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.780
 everything is clean 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:16.830
 so that all who are not critical that what 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.040
 hard sole and what they can 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.320
 slide on the surface is wet that is 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.980
 especially it will be i think is important if you 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.060
 where you will go hiking 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.970
 going on 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.560
 stones, respectively, I think you these 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.650
 shoes will not work if you want them 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.900
 polis just in the city in dry weather 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.419
 it seems to me to be great 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.040
 option because they are light i think 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.860
 even in winter with a walk right soon 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.560
 will not be enough such resistant to 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.480
 frost because in principle I dragged 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.610
 yes it is always even in winter even strong 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.100
 Frosts sneakers one question warm 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.500
 socks I was comfortable here even order 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.900
 so that the juice of the shoes will be all fine them 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.900
 here comes the gray and the bitch which 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:06.160
 accordingly makes just one piece 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.479
 boot without any there we have 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.110
 get stitches or sostykovok 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:16.750
 it turns out we are completely isolated 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.760
 the surface here is from the water a shoe and 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.660
 here you can see that this is all 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.960
 part 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.360
 membrane she is strong now just 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.760
 the camera can not take me this thing here 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.150
 so that goes and here it is, it is glued very 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.280
 firmly imprinted charging in the sole that's it 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:37.630
 there is such a kind of synthetic you 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.979
 lacquer lining well here's my short 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:44.050
