00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
guys can see that at all maybe if I try

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.959 
guys can see that at all maybe if I try
to<00:01:55.380> dim<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.680> light<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.189> bit<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.520> here

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to dim the light a little bit in here

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
to dim the light a little bit in here
there<00:01:57.299> see<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.829> how<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.219> lit<00:01:59.430> up

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
there see that how that's all lit up

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.120 
there see that how that's all lit up
like<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.990> numbers<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.740> dim

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
like that and then the numbers I can dim

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.039 
like that and then the numbers I can dim
this<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.329> pretty<00:02:06.540> much<00:02:06.630> take<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
this so I can pretty much take the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.820 
this so I can pretty much take the
numbers<00:02:07.350> away<00:02:08.119> make<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> come<00:02:09.509> back<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.470> know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
numbers away make you come back you know

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.330 
numbers away make you come back you know
depending<00:02:11.460> on<00:02:11.520> how<00:02:11.670> bright<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.940> want<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:13.340> you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
depending on how bright I want it you

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.800 
depending on how bright I want it you
see<00:02:14.520> what<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.700> could<00:02:14.910> do<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.150> turning<00:02:15.690> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
see what I could do about turning it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
see what I could do about turning it
down<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> could<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> gauge<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.400> little

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
down so you could see the gauge a little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.710 
down so you could see the gauge a little
bit<00:02:17.990> but<00:02:18.990> yeah<00:02:19.230> there's<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:21.120> got<00:02:21.300> seven

weather through the PA speaker that's
pretty<00:04:02.880> cool<00:04:03.120> then<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.170> got<00:04:04.320> your<00:04:04.440> noise

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
pretty cool then you got your noise

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.540 
pretty cool then you got your noise
blanking<00:04:05.690> system<00:04:06.690> that's<00:04:07.650> essentially<00:04:08.340> with

blanking system that's essentially with

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.509 
blanking system that's essentially with
the<00:04:08.910> NB<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.660> Al<00:04:11.959> forgot<00:04:12.959> what<00:04:13.110> e<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.650> L<00:04:14.130> stands

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
the NB and Al forgot what e and L stands

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.360 
the NB and Al forgot what e and L stands
for<00:04:14.840> should<00:04:15.840> know<00:04:15.989> what<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:17.220> it's

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
for should know what it is but it's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.580 
for should know what it is but it's
something<00:04:17.640> noise<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.239> limiter<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.840> forgot<00:04:19.440> what

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
something noise a limiter I forgot what

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.219 
something noise a limiter I forgot what
it<00:04:19.739> meant<00:04:19.979> then<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:20.880> got<00:04:21.060> an<00:04:21.239> B<00:04:21.900> which<00:04:22.080> is

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
it meant then you got an B which is

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.650 
it meant then you got an B which is
noise<00:04:22.470> blanketing<00:04:23.160> then<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.820> got<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.150> now

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
noise blanketing then you got a now

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660 
noise blanketing then you got a now
which<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.960> once<00:04:25.710> again<00:04:25.980> something<00:04:26.310> known<00:04:26.640> as

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
which is once again something known as

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.010 
which is once again something known as
limiter<00:04:27.090> or<00:04:27.330> off

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
limiter or off

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.840 
limiter or off
so<00:04:28.470> essentially<00:04:28.800> what<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.130> does<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.400> like

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
so essentially what that does that like

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.570 
so essentially what that does that like
when<00:04:30.030> you're<00:04:30.150> driving<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.130> hear<00:04:32.400> the

in my case truck or whatever your drive

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.140 
in my case truck or whatever your drive
and<00:04:38.070> you'll<00:04:38.160> hear<00:04:38.370> sometimes<00:04:38.850> hear<00:04:39.030> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
and you'll hear sometimes hear the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.720 
and you'll hear sometimes hear the

everything or you can go up one and you
get<00:04:47.100> selective<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.930> know<00:04:49.050> blanketing<00:04:49.790> or<00:04:50.790> you

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
get selective you know blanketing or you

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.790 
get selective you know blanketing or you
can<00:04:51.150> turn<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.420> all<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.720> way<00:04:51.810> up<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.560> get

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
can turn it all the way up and you get

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.610 
can turn it all the way up and you get
everything<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:53.850> blanked<00:04:54.210> out<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:55.530> then

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
everything is blanked out and then

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.420 
everything is blanked out and then
here's<00:04:55.890> your<00:04:56.130> other<00:04:57.030> set<00:04:57.420> got<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.200> SRF<00:04:58.650> SWR

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
here's your other set got the SRF SWR

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.030 
here's your other set got the SRF SWR
and<00:04:59.670> calibrate<00:05:00.320> that's<00:05:01.320> essentially<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:01.950> the

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
and calibrate that's essentially for the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.130 
and calibrate that's essentially for the
gauge<00:05:02.190> here<00:05:02.570> so<00:05:05.030> my<00:05:06.030> suggestions<00:05:06.720> are<00:05:06.870> if

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
gauge here so my suggestions are if

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.340 
gauge here so my suggestions are if
