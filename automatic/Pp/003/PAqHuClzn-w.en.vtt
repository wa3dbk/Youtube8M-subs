00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello to all so today we get 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.890
 found to show you how 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.340
 actually form fleets in the form of 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.420
 villainous flower lot that I had presented 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.180
 for the occasion of shavuot everything then 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.920
 it's very simple already started form 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:28.910
 4 strands of equal size 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:30.950
 then we will cross our arms there on 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.730
 the host and pretty much in the middle 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:40.310
 in fact each strand so that one 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.380
 go over and then go into 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.120
 below this one goes over 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.030
 then go underneath so we have them 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.050
 crossed as a friends command and then 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.220
 we will cross each each strand up 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.020
 to form a round flower so the brown of the 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.450
 underneath it is passed on the brown next door 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.520
 see on it we do the same for the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.770
 next here is so we actually turn 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.670
 then the brown of the top we go the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.820
 pass on its smaller neighbor above 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.810
 the same 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.350
 on this side the same 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.820
 on this side and finally the brown years that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.650
 is below we will pass it over 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.710
 then we continue exactly the same 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.850
 technique the strand below we pass it 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.900
 above his neighbor below have 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.900
 received from his neighbor 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.979
 So here we are, there are still some 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.310
 little browns actually on the outside who 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.310
 just hide so below 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.590
 like this 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.299
 here 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.150
 so I remember that in fact art to 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.250
 the east you have to let it rest at 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.069
 at least 30 minutes so you ask it on 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.480
 the plate you wash or cover it must 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.579
 cover you let them rest 30 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.769
 minutes for it to swell and then 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.569
 at the same time you preheat the oven to 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:35.560
 200 it will be necessary to cook them at 180 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:39.189
 degrees between 30 and 35 minutes okay 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.420
 some ovens or even 25 me enough for 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.639
 some do so so it's really in 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.459
 function of your fake that's it I hope 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.919
 or that referred you to be more that 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.900
 to serve you it's really very simple 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.150
 to realize and then it's always 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.290
 changes standard shapes and that's 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.359
 always nice for on a table 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.049
 shabbat or or of fact 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.049
 see you soon
