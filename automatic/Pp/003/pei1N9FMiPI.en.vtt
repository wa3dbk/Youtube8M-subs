00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello everyone on the news menu 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.740
 anecdotes about the renault qadjar 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.600
 the cabriolet evokes it's gone and a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.600
 promising challenge drift 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 it was the one tisnÃ© the novelty 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.160
 French of this show of Geneva the 2015 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
 renault qadjar the first compact suv of the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.289
 diamond should mark the spirits 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.369
 he actually lands in a segment 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 ultra-competitive and highly acclaimed 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.310
 one in five cars sold worldwide 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 is a crossover 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 so what characterizes the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.680
 cousin of qashqai focus on this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.200
 novelty in video with designers 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 renault on the upper part it's 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.120
 a very fluid body that is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.969
 carved that is sensual with wings 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 well muscled it gives him a posture 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.980
 athletic it feels like he's going 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.020
 to jump and on the lower part we have 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.260
 black protective elements that reassures 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.360
 who express any way with a ski 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 who also strongly sign the face 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 before that's really the spirit of the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 car there is the first good surprise 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.899
 that he discovered outside and then at 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.030
 the opening of the door it is necessary that it 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 is confirmed so we proposed a copy 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 of conduct where everything is centered on the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.710
 driver's pleasure and to this treatment 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.590
 quite marked identity graph that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.050
 is having this side oriented drivers 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.910
 something where everything falls under the hand 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.740
 the inspiration came from a mask of 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.140
 snowboarding for the very graphic side 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.240
 horizontal and I approached pray 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.580
 to stage the instrumentation 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 in a most horizontal set 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.240
 possible and that really highlights the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.060
 sportiness of the vehicle it becomes 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.980
 the signature element and all that is set 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.020
 by a fine chrome that brings a lot of 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.170
 refinement and of and quality to the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.330
 dashboard but flipping we have 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.240
 solicited the ideas of all my studio 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.450
 satellite design around the world and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.300
 these are r dc e our design studio at 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 bucharest and the cooperative laboratory

 this competition 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.370
 after we finish the design and execution 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.729
 here in paris 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.310

 2016 without further details for the time 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.440
 an unusual video accompanies however 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.300
 this ad from land rover 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.500

 capabilities of a 11th all terrain model 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.010
 hostile environment why not but 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.650
 How absurd idea that a film 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.200
 suv without you 40 meters underground 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 in short a whole concept the market of suv 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.860
 discover go is a niche 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.750
 so far only nissan had tried the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.790
 adventure in the usa with murano 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.280
 crosscabriolet a model whose 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.340
 production ceased in July 2014 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.920
 lack of buyer finish this jt with 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.450
 a video signed bmw a year after the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.580
 launch of its autonomous series 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.709
 able to drift is all alone 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.570
 the constructor according to a challenge he is going 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.850
 oppose his machine to a champion of 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.560
 drift the trailer of this duel just comes 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.930
 to be published on the youtube channel of 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.940
 constructor then who of the man or of 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.410
 the machine will succeed in buckling the most 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.330
 sliding rides in a perimeter 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 given his misbehavior 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.810
 we can not wait to find out more about the duels 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.760
 between men and cars 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.290
 autonomous is growing more and more 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.350
 last February it was our confreres 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.450
 sports car defying bobby rs7 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.000
 Autonomous audi on the ascari circuit 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.340
 and our Julian driver diez had 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.870
 kept chrono to support the editing 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.830
 remains to know for how long 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.830
