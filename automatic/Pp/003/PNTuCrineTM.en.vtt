hey what's up with your body more here
and<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.730> time<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> got<00:00:09.240> something<00:00:09.510> different

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
and this time I got something different

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.650 
and this time I got something different
person<00:00:11.010> basic<00:00:11.429> amount<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.820> an<00:00:11.969> emblem<00:00:12.330> editor

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
person basic amount is an emblem editor

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.250 
person basic amount is an emblem editor
for<00:00:13.160> emblems<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.670> game<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.240> projects<00:00:16.109> on

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
for emblems in the game it projects on

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.370 
for emblems in the game it projects on
vehicles<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.039> your<00:00:17.160> gun<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.930> thought

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
vehicles and on your gun so I thought

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800 
vehicles and on your gun so I thought
I'd<00:00:19.560> demonstrate<00:00:20.250> some<00:00:20.460> neat<00:00:21.029> tricks<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.779> can

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I'd demonstrate some neat tricks you can

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.410 
I'd demonstrate some neat tricks you can
use<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.650> make<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:22.949> own<00:00:23.070> ambulance<00:00:23.420> because

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
use to make your own ambulance because

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.000 
use to make your own ambulance because
if<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> logo<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.080> mind<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.740> might

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
if you have a logo like mind and might

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.769 
if you have a logo like mind and might
be<00:00:26.189> difficult<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.849> recreate<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
be difficult to recreate it in the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.790 
be difficult to recreate it in the
editor<00:00:28.310> without<00:00:29.449> well<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.960> making<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> look

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
editor without well not making it look

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.090 
editor without well not making it look
very<00:00:32.040> nice<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> found<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> solution<00:00:34.100> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
very nice so I found a solution it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310 
very nice so I found a solution it's
called<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.850> ground<00:00:36.090> reference<00:00:36.300> utility<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
called for ground reference utility and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.910 
called for ground reference utility and
what<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.980> does<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.610> overlays<00:00:39.000> an<00:00:39.239> image

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
what that does is it overlays an image

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
what that does is it overlays an image
over<00:00:40.920> everything<00:00:41.600> which<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.020> selectable

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
over everything which is not selectable

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.700 
over everything which is not selectable
and<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.190> transparent<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.530> see

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and it's transparent so as you can see

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.819 
and it's transparent so as you can see
here<00:00:46.950> already<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.710> an

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
here already you can see it I have an

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
here already you can see it I have an
image<00:00:49.980> over<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> editor<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.750> should<00:00:51.989> maybe

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
image over the editor which should maybe

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
image over the editor which should maybe
just<00:00:52.320> paint<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.340> pretty<00:00:53.670> much<00:00:53.940> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
just paint over it pretty much just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
just paint over it pretty much just
match<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> image<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.789> makes<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
match up with the image which makes it a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.229 
match up with the image which makes it a
lot<00:00:57.390> easier<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:58.250> recreate<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.609> forms<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
lot easier to recreate the forms and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
lot easier to recreate the forms and
shapes<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.070> useful<00:01:02.309> trick<00:01:02.640> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
shapes you want well not useful trick is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.630 
shapes you want well not useful trick is
for<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> precise<00:01:03.629> movements<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.559> make<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
for a precise movements is to make the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120 
for a precise movements is to make the
keyboard<00:01:06.060> move<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> cursor<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.979> mouse

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
keyboard move the cursor the mouse

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
keyboard move the cursor the mouse
cursor<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:09.570> way<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.170> able<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.500> do

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
cursor that way you will be able to do

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
cursor that way you will be able to do
pixel<00:01:11.159> precise<00:01:11.460> movements<00:01:12.000> instead<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> using

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
pixel precise movements instead of using

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.649 
pixel precise movements instead of using
the<00:01:13.350> mouse<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.729> sometimes<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the mouse because you know sometimes it

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.140 
the mouse because you know sometimes it
can<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:15.990> difficult<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.700> get<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> precise

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
can be difficult to get the precise

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
can be difficult to get the precise
movement<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.920> like<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.340> straight<00:01:20.670> up

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
movement you want like going straight up

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.560 
movement you want like going straight up
the<00:01:20.909> line<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.380> stuff<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the line and stuff like that and to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
the line and stuff like that and to
enable<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.619> need<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> hold<00:01:26.130> alt

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
enable that you just need to hold alt

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.050 
enable that you just need to hold alt
shift<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.630> num<00:01:27.960> lock<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.700> pop<00:01:29.909> up

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
shift and num lock and then go pop up

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
shift and num lock and then go pop up
and<00:01:30.270> finally<00:01:30.810> some<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.070> may<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.250> already

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and finally some of you may be already

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.569 
and finally some of you may be already

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
will zoom in and you might be able to do

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.830 
will zoom in and you might be able to do
more<00:01:43.439> precise<00:01:43.770> movements<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> well

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
more precise movements that way as well

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.620 
more precise movements that way as well
just<00:01:45.840> want<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> let<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> guys<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.680> so
