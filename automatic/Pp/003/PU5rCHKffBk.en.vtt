it was great let me let me just show you
a<00:00:02.129> picture<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.149> body<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.689> made<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.680> what

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
a picture of the body we made and what

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.010 
a picture of the body we made and what
we<00:00:05.640> were<00:00:05.730> trying<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.089> get<00:00:06.210> across<00:00:06.509> in<00:00:06.899> this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
we were trying to get across in this

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.919 
we were trying to get across in this
point<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.620> all<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.610> processes<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.540> diseases

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
point is all the processes and diseases

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
point is all the processes and diseases
that<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.730> associated<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:12.300> insulin

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
that are associated with insulin

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.660 
that are associated with insulin
resistance<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.099> show<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.370> this

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
resistance we just like to show you this

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.870 
resistance we just like to show you this
sure<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.160> know<00:00:17.190> you've<00:00:17.460> had<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> lot<00:00:17.850> of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
sure and I know you've had a lot of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.400 
sure and I know you've had a lot of
experts<00:00:18.390> talking<00:00:18.720> through<00:00:19.050> various

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
experts talking through various

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.960 
experts talking through various
parameters<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> focus<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.760> lot<00:00:20.789> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
parameters here and we focus a lot I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.429 
parameters here and we focus a lot I
think<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> heart<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.020> adipose

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
think on the heart and the adipose

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
think on the heart and the adipose

drawn to talking about when we talk
about<00:00:25.680> insulin<00:00:26.189> resistance<00:00:26.640> when<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.300> forget

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
about insulin resistance when we forget

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.200 
about insulin resistance when we forget
that<00:00:28.500> insulin<00:00:28.830> resistance<00:00:29.279> not<00:00:29.519> only<00:00:29.789> impacts

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to be the focus because you want to make

people feel better and have normal
cycles<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:20.040> what's<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> root<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
cycles but what's really at the root of

cycles but what's really at the root of
that<00:01:22.650> disease<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.430> insulin<00:01:24.240> resistance

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that disease is insulin resistance

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to have challenges with ovulation and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
to have challenges with ovulation and
that's<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.409> part<00:01:40.650> makes<00:01:40.829> her<00:01:41.009> cycles

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that's what in part makes her cycles

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
that's what in part makes her cycles
irregular<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> fix<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.290> what

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
irregular so you want to fix that what

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
irregular so you want to fix that what
doctors<00:01:44.070> typically<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.939> plop<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
doctors typically do is you plop the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
doctors typically do is you plop the

that<00:03:47.769> you've<00:03:47.920> obviously<00:03:48.190> developed<00:03:49.060> that

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
that you've obviously developed that

that you've obviously developed that
over<00:03:49.600> time<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.109> have<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.380> 50%<00:03:50.950> increased

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
over time you now have a 50% increased

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.710 
risk of developing Frank diabetes we
should<00:03:53.920> be<00:03:54.040> very<00:03:54.579> aggressively<00:03:55.120> monitoring

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
should be very aggressively monitoring

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.449 
should be very aggressively monitoring
those<00:03:55.870> women<00:03:56.230> for<00:03:56.650> insulin<00:03:57.010> resistance

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
those women for insulin resistance

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.670 
those women for insulin resistance
looking<00:03:57.790> at<00:03:57.910> a1<00:03:58.030> C<00:03:58.389> doing<00:03:58.810> NMR's<00:03:59.260> trying<00:03:59.620> to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
looking at a1 C doing NMR's trying to

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.949 
looking at a1 C doing NMR's trying to
find<00:03:59.859> other<00:04:00.069> ways<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.670> assess<00:04:01.420> an<00:04:01.630> insulin

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
find other ways to assess an insulin

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.539 
find other ways to assess an insulin
resistance<00:04:02.380> state<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:02.859> that<00:04:03.010> down<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.250> road

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
resistance state so that down the road

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.390 
resistance state so that down the road
we<00:04:03.819> can<00:04:04.000> prevent<00:04:04.709> potential<00:04:05.709> complications

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
we can prevent potential complications

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.949 
we can prevent potential complications
so<00:04:06.609> those<00:04:06.760> are<00:04:06.910> there<00:04:07.359> are<00:04:07.450> some<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.750> key

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
so those are there are some of the key

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.449 
so those are there are some of the key

resistance that really impact a woman
specifically<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.489> then<00:04:12.910> there's<00:04:13.090> one<00:04:13.269> area

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
specifically and then there's one area

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.909 
specifically and then there's one area
here<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.780> know<00:04:13.930> everyone's<00:04:14.290> kind<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.680> touched

here I know everyone's kind of touched

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.409 
here I know everyone's kind of touched

on a lot of yet areas but I want to hit
the<00:04:16.570> brain<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.139> don't<00:04:17.560> know<00:04:17.620> how<00:04:17.739> much<00:04:17.889> we've

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
the brain I don't know how much we've

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.819 
the brain I don't know how much we've
talked<00:04:18.310> about<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.669> brain<00:04:18.849> all<00:04:19.660> right<00:04:19.840> I<00:04:20.139> want

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
talked about the brain all right I want

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.110 
talked about the brain all right I want
to<00:04:20.859> talk<00:04:21.010> about<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.340> brain<00:04:21.549> because<00:04:21.970> we

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
to talk about the brain because we

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.899 
to talk about the brain because we
forget<00:04:22.479> that<00:04:22.690> insulin<00:04:23.169> resistance<00:04:23.909> impacts

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.510 
normally when we wake up in the morning
we<00:04:29.960> have<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.260> surge<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.800> dopamine<00:04:30.979> and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
we have the surge of dopamine and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.790 
we have the surge of dopamine and
dopamine<00:04:32.210> basically<00:04:32.840> sets<00:04:33.080> off<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.260> cascade<00:04:33.770> of

morning and it's flatline what does that
do<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.550> actually<00:04:58.789> causes<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.870> cascade<00:05:00.350> of

throughout the course of the day what's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.890 
throughout the course of the day what's

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
interesting is that there's actually new

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.950 
interesting is that there's actually new
therapies<00:05:15.410> now<00:05:15.650> for<00:05:16.639> diabetes<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.570> target

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
therapies now for diabetes that target

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.379 
therapies now for diabetes that target
that<00:05:18.110> pathway<00:05:18.610> completely<00:05:19.610> new<00:05:19.820> unique

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
that pathway completely new unique

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.600 
that pathway completely new unique
mechanism<00:05:20.830> but<00:05:21.830> what's<00:05:22.010> interesting<00:05:22.190> about

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
mechanism but what's interesting about

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.129 
mechanism but what's interesting about
those<00:05:22.940> drugs<00:05:23.330> is<00:05:23.539> that<00:05:23.690> they're<00:05:23.870> very

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
those drugs is that they're very

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.750 
those drugs is that they're very
effective<00:05:24.530> not<00:05:24.860> just<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.340> patient<00:05:25.669> with

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
effective not just in the patient with

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.340 
effective not just in the patient with
diabetes<00:05:25.880> but<00:05:26.419> in<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.570> patient<00:05:26.930> with<00:05:27.020> insulin

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
diabetes but in the patient with insulin

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.350 
diabetes but in the patient with insulin
resistance<00:05:27.760> although<00:05:28.760> as<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:29.030> know<00:05:29.150> there's

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
resistance although as you know there's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.000 
resistance although as you know there's
no<00:05:29.510> drug<00:05:29.750> approved<00:05:30.080> for<00:05:30.139> insulin<00:05:30.560> resistance

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
no drug approved for insulin resistance

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.560 
no drug approved for insulin resistance
they're<00:05:31.220> very<00:05:31.370> effective<00:05:31.639> they're<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.419> one

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
they're very effective they're the one

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.820 
they're very effective they're the one
I'm<00:05:32.660> talking<00:05:32.810> about<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:33.440> quick<00:05:33.650> release

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
I'm talking about is the quick release

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.740 
I'm talking about is the quick release
bromocriptine<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:35.210> if<00:05:35.330> you've<00:05:35.479> heard<00:05:35.690> of

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
bromocriptine and if you've heard of

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.890 
bromocriptine and if you've heard of
that

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
that

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.719 
that
it's<00:05:36.289> called<00:05:36.500> cycle<00:05:36.919> set<00:05:37.070> it's<00:05:37.190> marketed<00:05:37.610> that

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
it's called cycle set it's marketed that

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.610 
it's called cycle set it's marketed that
way<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.479> what<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.780> drug<00:05:38.990> is<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.349> it's<00:05:39.500> a

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
way and what the drug is is it's a

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.089 
way and what the drug is is it's a
dopamine<00:05:39.919> agonist<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:41.690> with<00:05:42.500> when<00:05:42.950> it's

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
dopamine agonist that with when it's

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.770 
dopamine agonist that with when it's
taken<00:05:43.460> first<00:05:43.729> thing<00:05:43.940> in<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.090> morning<00:05:44.479> within

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
taken first thing in the morning within

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.600 
taken first thing in the morning within
two<00:05:44.990> hours<00:05:45.020> of<00:05:45.470> waking<00:05:45.770> up<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.099> gives<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.490> body

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
two hours of waking up it gives the body

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.450 
two hours of waking up it gives the body
this<00:05:46.940> dopamine<00:05:47.479> surge<00:05:47.750> which<00:05:48.349> resets<00:05:49.039> the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
this dopamine surge which resets the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.820 
this dopamine surge which resets the
hypothalamic<00:05:50.210> clock<00:05:50.479> and<00:05:50.780> allows<00:05:51.380> for<00:05:51.800> a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
hypothalamic clock and allows for a

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.560 
hypothalamic clock and allows for a
resetting<00:05:52.310> of<00:05:52.400> all<00:05:52.550> these<00:05:52.700> abnormalities<00:05:53.389> so

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
resetting of all these abnormalities so

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.300 
resetting of all these abnormalities so
what<00:05:53.720> ultimately<00:05:53.810> happens<00:05:54.530> blood<00:05:55.070> pressure

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
what ultimately happens blood pressure

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.390 
what ultimately happens blood pressure
drops<00:05:55.780> triglycerides<00:05:56.780> may<00:05:56.960> drop<00:05:57.169> up<00:05:57.349> to<00:05:57.380> 30%

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
drops triglycerides may drop up to 30%

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.580 
drops triglycerides may drop up to 30%
postprandial<00:05:59.030> glucose<00:05:59.660> traps<00:06:00.020> and<00:06:00.289> you're

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
postprandial glucose traps and you're

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.379 
postprandial glucose traps and you're
basically<00:06:00.949> resetting<00:06:01.669> that<00:06:01.699> brain<00:06:02.120> clock

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
basically resetting that brain clock

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.820 
basically resetting that brain clock
that's<00:06:02.599> been<00:06:02.810> impacted<00:06:03.320> by<00:06:03.349> insulin

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
that's been impacted by insulin

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.439 
that's been impacted by insulin
resistance<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.430> that's<00:06:04.520> something<00:06:04.820> that's

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
resistance and that's something that's

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.210 
resistance and that's something that's
even<00:06:05.690> beyond<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.349> you<00:06:06.530> know<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.740> Alzheimer's

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
even beyond the you know the Alzheimer's

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.439 
even beyond the you know the Alzheimer's
and<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.430> stroke<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:07.940> dementia<00:06:08.330> issues

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
and the stroke and the dementia issues

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.879 
and the stroke and the dementia issues
that<00:06:08.750> we<00:06:08.840> may<00:06:08.960> talk<00:06:09.169> about<00:06:09.470> with<00:06:09.620> insulin

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
that we may talk about with insulin

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.620 
that we may talk about with insulin
resistance<00:06:09.949> as<00:06:10.460> well<00:06:10.610> but<00:06:10.760> it's<00:06:10.910> an<00:06:11.000> area<00:06:11.210> I

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
resistance as well but it's an area I

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.390 
resistance as well but it's an area I
don't<00:06:12.020> hear<00:06:12.289> talked<00:06:12.620> about<00:06:12.889> enough<00:06:13.130> and<00:06:13.280> I

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
don't hear talked about enough and I

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.890 
don't hear talked about enough and I
think<00:06:13.580> it's<00:06:13.699> important<00:06:14.150> and<00:06:14.389> we<00:06:14.750> have

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
think it's important and we have

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.659 
think it's important and we have
therapies<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.830> actually<00:06:16.190> target<00:06:16.340> that

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
therapies to actually target that

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:26.460 
therapies to actually target that
pathway<00:06:17.199> so

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.530
