welcome<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.780> learn<00:00:00.960> biology<00:00:01.199> and<00:00:02.040> we're<00:00:02.220> still

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
welcome to learn biology and we're still

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.640 
welcome to learn biology and we're still
on<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.730> topic<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.240> organic<00:00:03.810> chemistry<00:00:04.170> and

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
on the topic of organic chemistry and

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.909 
on the topic of organic chemistry and
today<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.130> discussing<00:00:06.109> carbohydrates<00:00:07.109> so

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
today we're discussing carbohydrates so

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.919 
today we're discussing carbohydrates so
let's<00:00:08.130> start<00:00:08.400> with<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> name<00:00:08.929> carbohydrates

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
let's start with the name carbohydrates

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
let's start with the name carbohydrates
to<00:00:10.170> figure<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.650> what<00:00:11.240> carbohydrates<00:00:12.240> are

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
to figure out what carbohydrates are

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.950 
to figure out what carbohydrates are
made<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.429> so<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.610> see<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> name

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
made out of so we see here in the name

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.800 
made out of so we see here in the name
that<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.529> has<00:00:16.770> carbo<00:00:18.890> hydrates<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> carbo

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that it has carbo hydrates so carbo

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.380 
that it has carbo hydrates so carbo
means<00:00:22.230> carbon<00:00:24.199> hydrates<00:00:25.199> mean<00:00:27.109> hydrogen<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
means carbon hydrates mean hydrogen and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
means carbon hydrates mean hydrogen and
oxygen<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.990> carbohydrates<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.219> made<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
oxygen so carbohydrates are made out of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.900 
oxygen so carbohydrates are made out of
three<00:00:33.390> prime<00:00:33.780> elements<00:00:34.469> carbon<00:00:34.860> hydrogen<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
three prime elements carbon hydrogen and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.799 
three prime elements carbon hydrogen and
oxygen

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
oxygen

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.970 
oxygen
and<00:00:36.920> what<00:00:37.920> carbohydrates<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.980> sugars

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and what carbohydrates are are sugars

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
and what carbohydrates are are sugars
and<00:00:41.250> starches<00:00:41.899> starches<00:00:42.899> meaning<00:00:43.350> like

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and starches starches meaning like

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.540 
and starches starches meaning like
potatoes<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.260> pasta<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.070> what

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
potatoes and a pasta and all and what

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.580 
potatoes and a pasta and all and what
they're<00:00:47.760> used<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:49.219> energy<00:00:50.219> they're<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
they're used for is energy they're the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.720 
they're used for is energy they're the
most<00:00:52.670> versatile<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.890> diverse<00:00:55.890> form<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
most versatile and diverse form of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.900 
most versatile and diverse form of
energy<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.410> primary<00:00:58.980> source<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.550> energy

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
energy and the primary source of energy

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.539 
energy and the primary source of energy
in<00:01:00.980> cells<00:01:02.149> what<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.809> generate<00:01:04.549> ATP

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
in cells what to do is generate ATP

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
in cells what to do is generate ATP
which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:08.510> TP<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> form<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.430> energy

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
which is a TP which is a form of energy

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.730 
which is a TP which is a form of energy
known<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.680> Denman<00:01:14.150> triphosphate<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.810> what

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
known as a Denman triphosphate and what

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.520 
known as a Denman triphosphate and what
it's<00:01:16.890> used<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.759> instant<00:01:18.479> energy<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it's used for is instant energy so

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.929 
it's used for is instant energy so
instant<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:23.549> three<00:01:23.909> main

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
instant but now there are three main

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.800 
instant but now there are three main
forms<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:25.040> carbohydrates<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:28.159> they<00:01:29.159> are

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
forms of carbohydrates and they are

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.429 
forms of carbohydrates and they are
monosaccharides<00:01:31.159> disaccharides<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
monosaccharides disaccharides and

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.390 
monosaccharides disaccharides and
polysaccharides<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.970> tip<00:01:37.220> like<00:01:38.220> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
polysaccharides and just a tip like we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
polysaccharides and just a tip like we
said<00:01:38.729> earlier<00:01:39.500> carbohydrates<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.770> made<00:01:40.799> out

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
said earlier carbohydrates are made out

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.929 
said earlier carbohydrates are made out
of<00:01:41.340> simple<00:01:42.119> sugars<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.500> sugars<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> then

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
of simple sugars and all sugars and then

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.270 
of simple sugars and all sugars and then
os--<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.740> thing<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
os-- that's just a little thing to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.109 
os-- that's just a little thing to
remember<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:48.649> primary<00:01:49.649> biology<00:01:50.610> tip<00:01:50.880> right

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
remember a primary biology tip right

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:51.469 
remember a primary biology tip right
there

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
there

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.770 
there
sugar<00:01:51.960> equal<00:01:52.680> os--<00:01:55.640> but<00:01:56.640> let's<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.240> started

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
sugar equal os-- but let's get started

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.149 
sugar equal os-- but let's get started
so<00:01:58.700> monosaccharides<00:02:00.590> monosaccharides<00:02:01.590> are

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
so monosaccharides monosaccharides are

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.139 
so monosaccharides monosaccharides are
the<00:02:02.340> simplest<00:02:03.020> carbohydrates<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.700> simple<00:02:05.700> so

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the simplest carbohydrates so simple so

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
the simplest carbohydrates so simple so
just<00:02:06.180> sim

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
just sim

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
just sim
and<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.379> are<00:02:10.409> are<00:02:11.280> composed<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.420> four

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and what they are are composed of four

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.500 
and what they are are composed of four
to<00:02:14.010> six<00:02:14.540> carbons<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:18.590> some<00:02:19.590> examples<00:02:20.189> include

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
to six carbons and some examples include

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.899 
to six carbons and some examples include
glucose<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.840> fructose<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.890> we<00:02:23.640> saw<00:02:23.879> earlier

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
glucose and fructose as we saw earlier

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.000 
glucose and fructose as we saw earlier
in<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:25.700> back<00:02:26.700> video<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:28.319> introduction<00:02:28.739> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
in the back video the introduction to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.390 
in the back video the introduction to
organic<00:02:29.400> chemistry<00:02:29.780> fructose<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.400> monomer

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
organic chemistry fructose is a monomer

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
organic chemistry fructose is a monomer
and<00:02:33.620> that's<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.700> monosaccharides

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and that's you see here monosaccharides

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.770 
and that's you see here monosaccharides
meaning<00:02:37.290> simple<00:02:38.099> sugars<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.209> these<00:02:39.420> two<00:02:39.750> are

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
meaning simple sugars so these two are

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.440 
meaning simple sugars so these two are
simple<00:02:40.470> sugars<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.519> motor<00:02:41.819> saccharides

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
simple sugars and one motor saccharides

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.860 
simple sugars and one motor saccharides
are<00:02:42.720> our<00:02:43.190> building<00:02:44.190> blocks<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:45.090> other<00:02:46.519> bigger

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
are our building blocks for other bigger

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.080 
are our building blocks for other bigger
carbohydrates<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.769> some<00:02:50.129> other<00:02:50.310> examples<00:02:51.000> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
carbohydrates so some other examples of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.910 
carbohydrates so some other examples of
monosaccharides<00:02:51.920> include<00:02:52.940> ribose<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.920> note

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
monosaccharides include ribose and note

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.580 
monosaccharides include ribose and note
something<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.879> like<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:57.329> said<00:02:57.540> earlier<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
something here like we said earlier the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.129 
something here like we said earlier the
endings<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.750> all<00:03:00.750> sugars<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.709> then<00:03:02.010> os--<00:03:03.139> but

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
endings of all sugars and then os-- but

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.710 
endings of all sugars and then os-- but
this<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.889> just<00:03:05.040> another<00:03:05.220> type<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.879> sugar<00:03:06.090> found

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
this is just another type of sugar found

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.869 
this is just another type of sugar found
in<00:03:07.010> DNA<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.280> then<00:03:08.790> there's<00:03:10.190> deoxyribose<00:03:11.190> also

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
in DNA and then there's deoxyribose also

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.920 
in DNA and then there's deoxyribose also
found<00:03:12.329> in<00:03:12.510> DNA<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.090> actually<00:03:15.449> found<00:03:15.750> in

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
found in DNA this is actually found in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.140 
found in DNA this is actually found in
RNA<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.949> we'll<00:03:17.340> discuss<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.819> later<00:03:18.480> on

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
RNA but we'll discuss that later on

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.520 
RNA but we'll discuss that later on
so<00:03:21.260> when<00:03:22.310> monosaccharides<00:03:23.310> are<00:03:24.530> built

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so when monosaccharides are built

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.909 
so when monosaccharides are built
together<00:03:26.250> they<00:03:26.879> form<00:03:27.650> disaccharides<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
together they form disaccharides and

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:36.759 
together they form disaccharides and
note<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:32.660> prefix<00:03:33.660> here<00:03:34.099> die-die<00:03:35.150> meaning<00:03:36.150> two

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
note the prefix here die-die meaning two

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.020 
note the prefix here die-die meaning two
saccharides<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:38.400> what<00:03:38.609> they<00:03:38.849> are<00:03:38.879> are<00:03:39.290> two

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
saccharides so what they are are two

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.110 
saccharides so what they are are two
monosaccharides<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:43.489> here<00:03:44.489> are<00:03:44.790> some

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
monosaccharides and here are some

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.210 
monosaccharides and here are some
examples

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
examples

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.119 
examples
this<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.430> lactose<00:03:48.060> right<00:03:48.419> here<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.930> what<00:03:49.650> left

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
this is lactose right here and what left

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.789 
this is lactose right here and what left
toasts<00:03:50.699> is<00:03:50.819> made<00:03:51.419> out<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:53.419> simple<00:03:54.419> sugar

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
toasts is made out of is a simple sugar

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:05.750 
toasts is made out of is a simple sugar
glucose<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:59.510> galactose<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.500> go<00:04:01.919> act<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:03.090> left

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.140 

and<00:04:05.849> then<00:04:06.629> oh<00:04:06.780> s---<00:04:07.610> here<00:04:08.610> we<00:04:08.909> have<00:04:09.409> sucrose<00:04:10.409> a

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
and then oh s--- here we have sucrose a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.289 
and then oh s--- here we have sucrose a
disaccharide<00:04:12.650> which<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.340> is<00:04:14.579> table

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
disaccharide which is this is table

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.030 
disaccharide which is this is table
sugar<00:04:15.329> so<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.709> table<00:04:17.160> sugar<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:18.329> is

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
sugar so this is table sugar and it is

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.800 
sugar so this is table sugar and it is
bonded<00:04:20.389> glucose<00:04:21.389> guk<00:04:22.789> plus<00:04:24.110> fructose<00:04:25.110> and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
bonded glucose guk plus fructose and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.310 
bonded glucose guk plus fructose and
here<00:04:27.810> we<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.320> motors<00:04:29.250> which<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.729> found<00:04:30.000> in

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
here we have motors which is found in

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.129 
here we have motors which is found in
alcoholic<00:04:31.320> beverages<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:34.010> glucose

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
alcoholic beverages and it is glucose

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.279 
alcoholic beverages and it is glucose
plus<00:04:37.139> another<00:04:38.150> glucose<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.960> point<00:04:40.199> here

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
plus another glucose but the point here

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.820 
plus another glucose but the point here
is<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.970> disaccharides<00:04:41.970> are<00:04:42.830> slightly

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
is that disaccharides are slightly

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.040 
is that disaccharides are slightly
larger<00:04:44.490> than<00:04:44.520> monosaccharides<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.810> there

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
larger than monosaccharides and there

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.600 
larger than monosaccharides and there
are<00:04:46.110> two<00:04:46.470> monosaccharides<00:04:47.370> bonded<00:04:48.360> together

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
are two monosaccharides bonded together

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.909 
are two monosaccharides bonded together
so<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:51.120> third<00:04:51.360> type<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.720> carbon<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.530> we<00:04:52.680> have

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
so the third type of carbon that we have

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.110 
so the third type of carbon that we have
is<00:04:53.190> called<00:04:54.710> polysaccharide<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.979> what<00:04:56.580> poly

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
is called polysaccharide and what poly

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.409 
is called polysaccharide and what poly
means<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:58.699> many<00:04:59.699> so<00:05:00.539> many<00:05:01.139> and<00:05:02.000> these<00:05:03.000> are

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
means is many so many and these are

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:11.469 
means is many so many and these are
known<00:05:03.720> as<00:05:04.729> true<00:05:05.729> carbon<00:05:06.860> carbohydrates<00:05:07.860> true

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.189 

carbohydrates<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:13.760> these<00:05:14.760> are<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.199> cards

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
carbohydrates and these are the cards

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.029 
carbohydrates and these are the cards
that<00:05:16.410> provide<00:05:16.500> high<00:05:17.310> amounts<00:05:17.849> of<00:05:17.940> energy<00:05:18.180> and

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
that provide high amounts of energy and

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.310 
that provide high amounts of energy and
here<00:05:20.039> are<00:05:20.190> some<00:05:20.430> examples<00:05:21.090> starch<00:05:21.930> is<00:05:22.260> a

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
here are some examples starch is a

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.860 
here are some examples starch is a
carbohydrate<00:05:23.120> made<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.620> hundreds<00:05:25.620> of

carbohydrate made up of hundreds of
glucose<00:05:27.870> molecules

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
glucose molecules

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.260 
glucose molecules
hundreds<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:30.860> glucose<00:05:32.900> hooked<00:05:33.900> together<00:05:34.440> and

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
hundreds of glucose hooked together and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.719 
hundreds of glucose hooked together and
they<00:05:36.270> for<00:05:36.990> example<00:05:37.080> in<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.830> potato<00:05:38.220> we<00:05:38.699> have

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
they for example in a potato we have

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.960 
they for example in a potato we have
hundreds<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.840> glucose<00:05:40.520> bonded<00:05:41.520> together<00:05:41.639> in

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
hundreds of glucose bonded together in

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.040 
hundreds of glucose bonded together in
the<00:05:42.240> provide<00:05:42.599> energy<00:05:42.930> when<00:05:43.560> eaten<00:05:45.050> glycogen

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
the provide energy when eaten glycogen

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.189 
the provide energy when eaten glycogen
is<00:05:46.849> a<00:05:47.930> starch<00:05:48.930> with<00:05:50.300> extensions<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:51.720> if<00:05:51.960> we

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
is a starch with extensions so if we

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.029 
is a starch with extensions so if we
have<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.909> glucose<00:05:53.909> here<00:05:54.210> for<00:05:54.599> example<00:05:54.930> then<00:05:55.889> it

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
have a glucose here for example then it

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.969 
have a glucose here for example then it
would<00:05:56.190> have<00:05:56.400> branches<00:05:57.360> coming<00:05:57.630> off<00:05:57.979> then

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
would have branches coming off then

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.600 
would have branches coming off then
another<00:05:59.300> glucose<00:06:00.300> connected<00:06:01.260> but<00:06:01.710> simply<00:06:02.340> it

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
another glucose connected but simply it

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.290 
another glucose connected but simply it
is<00:06:02.990> starch<00:06:03.990> with<00:06:04.260> branches<00:06:04.889> and<00:06:05.130> this<00:06:06.060> is

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
is starch with branches and this is

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.810 
is starch with branches and this is
usually<00:06:06.570> known<00:06:07.199> as<00:06:08.389> animal<00:06:09.389> starch<00:06:10.820> animals

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
usually known as animal starch animals

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.949 
usually known as animal starch animals
and<00:06:12.530> this<00:06:13.530> provides<00:06:14.070> energy<00:06:14.729> and<00:06:16.130> animals

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:17.959 
and this provides energy and animals

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:21.389 
and this provides energy and animals
long-term<00:06:18.559> energy<00:06:19.069> that<00:06:19.849> is<00:06:20.059> then<00:06:20.869> we<00:06:20.929> have

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:21.399 
long-term energy that is then we have

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:25.479 
long-term energy that is then we have
cellulose<00:06:22.399> this<00:06:23.360> is<00:06:23.689> what<00:06:24.229> makes<00:06:24.559> up<00:06:24.830> grass

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:25.489 
cellulose this is what makes up grass

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:28.869 
cellulose this is what makes up grass
and<00:06:26.059> plants<00:06:26.749> and<00:06:26.929> there<00:06:27.619> it<00:06:27.860> is<00:06:28.189> indigestible

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
and plants and there it is indigestible

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:34.469 
and plants and there it is indigestible
it<00:06:29.599> has<00:06:30.549> thousands<00:06:31.549> of<00:06:31.789> glucose<00:06:32.499> molecules

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
it has thousands of glucose molecules

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.809 
it has thousands of glucose molecules
bonded<00:06:35.479> together<00:06:35.659> making<00:06:36.619> it<00:06:36.889> indigestible

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
bonded together making it indigestible

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.409 
bonded together making it indigestible
by<00:06:38.269> human<00:06:38.689> beings<00:06:38.929> but<00:06:39.909> this<00:06:40.909> is<00:06:41.059> a<00:06:41.089> very

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
by human beings but this is a very

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.369 
by human beings but this is a very
complicated<00:06:41.899> carbon<00:06:42.709> and<00:06:42.889> it<00:06:43.339> makes<00:06:43.729> up

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
complicated carbon and it makes up

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:50.859 
complicated carbon and it makes up
plants<00:06:47.169> then<00:06:48.169> we<00:06:48.469> have<00:06:48.739> this<00:06:49.429> called<00:06:49.939> chitin

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:50.869 
plants then we have this called chitin

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:55.749 
plants then we have this called chitin
and<00:06:52.059> it<00:06:53.059> makes<00:06:53.539> up<00:06:53.809> the<00:06:54.079> shells<00:06:54.439> of<00:06:54.800> insects<00:06:55.399> if

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
and it makes up the shells of insects if

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.350 
and it makes up the shells of insects if
you<00:06:56.059> ever<00:06:56.329> you<00:06:56.869> know<00:06:56.899> just<00:06:57.759> crush<00:06:58.759> the<00:06:59.089> bug

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
you ever you know just crush the bug

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.439 
you ever you know just crush the bug
taking<00:07:00.319> its<00:07:00.499> life<00:07:00.769> and<00:07:01.479> you<00:07:02.479> hear<00:07:02.749> that<00:07:03.050> crunch

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
taking its life and you hear that crunch

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:10.089 
taking its life and you hear that crunch
that's<00:07:05.449> the<00:07:05.779> chitin<00:07:06.169> and<00:07:07.509> it's<00:07:08.509> a<00:07:08.959> it<00:07:09.379> what<00:07:09.979> it

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:10.099 
that's the chitin and it's a it what it

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.249 
that's the chitin and it's a it what it
does<00:07:10.129> is<00:07:10.550> make<00:07:10.759> up<00:07:10.999> the<00:07:11.179> shell<00:07:11.629> of<00:07:11.989> an

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:12.259 
does is make up the shell of an

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.799 
does is make up the shell of an
insect-like<00:07:12.829> a<00:07:12.949> beetle<00:07:13.099> or<00:07:13.669> something<00:07:14.179> it<00:07:14.329> is

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:14.809 
insect-like a beetle or something it is

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:19.409 
insect-like a beetle or something it is
the<00:07:15.699> exoskeleton<00:07:16.699> so<00:07:17.029> EXO<00:07:17.959> skeleton<00:07:18.529> and

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
the exoskeleton so EXO skeleton and

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.040 
the exoskeleton so EXO skeleton and
that's<00:07:20.419> what<00:07:20.839> make<00:07:21.679> up<00:07:21.949> carbohydrates<00:07:23.050> so

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
that's what make up carbohydrates so

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.559 
that's what make up carbohydrates so
thank<00:07:24.349> you<00:07:24.469> for<00:07:24.619> watching<00:07:24.889> men<00:07:25.610> biology<00:07:26.360> and

thank you for watching men biology and

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:29.139 
thank you for watching men biology and
we'll<00:07:26.779> be<00:07:26.959> going<00:07:27.709> into<00:07:27.860> different<00:07:28.550> types<00:07:28.849> of

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:29.149 
we'll be going into different types of

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:32.439 
we'll be going into different types of
reactions<00:07:29.929> in<00:07:30.499> organic<00:07:30.919> chemistry<00:07:31.610> see<00:07:32.329> you

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:32.449 
reactions in organic chemistry see you

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:34.929 
reactions in organic chemistry see you
next<00:07:32.749> time
