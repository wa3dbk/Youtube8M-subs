when<00:02:10.180> they<00:02:10.300> build<00:02:10.509> as<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.750> don't<00:02:10.869> know<00:02:10.960> if<00:02:11.020> it's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
when they build as I don't know if it's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.390 
when they build as I don't know if it's
the<00:02:11.290> original<00:02:11.350> hopefully<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.220> was<00:02:12.310> in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
the original hopefully it was in

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.030 
the original hopefully it was in
replacement<00:02:13.060> one<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.800> they'll<00:02:14.800> come<00:02:15.010> off

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
replacement one and they'll come off

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.020 
replacement one and they'll come off
fairly<00:02:15.850> easy<00:02:16.240> as<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.660> rear<00:02:16.930> one<00:02:17.110> did<00:02:21.030> now

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
fairly easy as this rear one did now

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.860 
fairly easy as this rear one did now
would<00:02:22.180> be<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.360> time<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.990> me<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:27.510> try<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.570> fix

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
would be the time for me to a try to fix

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.960 
would be the time for me to a try to fix
this<00:02:29.650> piece<00:02:29.950> as<00:02:30.220> well<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.340> yeah<00:02:33.670> I'm<00:02:33.760> going<00:02:33.910> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.740 
issues right here too because that's
where<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.800> seam<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.700> can<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.030> here<00:03:09.750> this

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
where the seam is you can see here this

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.860 
where the seam is you can see here this
is<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> up<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.220> right<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.489> out<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:18.510> I'll<00:03:19.510> get<00:03:19.720> all

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
is a up and right on out to I'll get all

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170 
is a up and right on out to I'll get all
that<00:03:19.989> out<00:03:20.050> get<00:03:20.410> all<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.709> out<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:20.980> I'll<00:03:21.970> keep

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
that out get all that out and I'll keep

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.630 
that out get all that out and I'll keep
you<00:03:22.360> posted

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.699 

that's<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.420> day<00:03:26.320> one<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:28.410> getting<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> roof

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
that's a day one of getting the roof

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.810 
that's a day one of getting the roof
prepped<00:03:30.160> for<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:31.000> new<00:03:31.150> donor<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:33.190> figured

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.520 

I'll<00:03:36.820> learn<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.540> one<00:03:37.780> because<00:03:37.989> on<00:03:38.350> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
I'll learn on this one because on the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.140 
I'll learn on this one because on the
new<00:03:38.680> on<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.040> new<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.340> I'm<00:03:39.459> getting<00:03:39.640> there

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
new on the new one I'm getting there

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.030 
new on the new one I'm getting there
cutting<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:41.190> right<00:03:42.190> around<00:03:42.459> here<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.650> they're

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
cutting it right around here so they're

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.000 
cutting it right around here so they're
cutting<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.459> over<00:03:45.700> there<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:47.739> get<00:03:47.860> this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
cutting it over there I can get this

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.830 
cutting it over there I can get this
thing<00:03:48.250> off<00:03:48.400> successfully<00:03:48.760> I'll<00:03:49.239> know<00:03:49.360> exactly

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
thing off successfully I'll know exactly

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.220 
thing off successfully I'll know exactly
where<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:51.489> hunt<00:03:51.670> for<00:03:51.880> all<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.209> spot<00:03:52.810> welds<00:03:53.110> and

where to hunt for all the spot welds and

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.620 
where to hunt for all the spot welds and
everything<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.769> new<00:03:53.920> one<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.480> I'm<00:03:55.480> going

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
everything on the new one and I'm going

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.070 
everything on the new one and I'm going
to<00:03:55.660> have<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:56.019> one<00:03:56.230> completely<00:03:56.709> clean<00:03:57.160> primed

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
to have that one completely clean primed

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.360 
to have that one completely clean primed
rust<00:03:59.080> proof<00:03:59.410> stand<00:03:59.680> everything<00:03:59.890> before<00:04:00.340> I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
rust proof stand everything before I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.330 
rust proof stand everything before I
even<00:04:00.580> put<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.650> well<00:04:02.650> I'm<00:04:02.770> definitely<00:04:03.010> going<00:04:03.280> to

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
even put it well I'm definitely going to

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.650 
even put it well I'm definitely going to
rush<00:04:03.520> this<00:04:03.640> proof<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.060> I'll<00:04:04.150> probably<00:04:04.270> prime

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
rush this proof it I'll probably prime

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.089 
rush this proof it I'll probably prime
it<00:04:04.810> on<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.020> car<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:05.440> I'll<00:04:05.560> have<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.800> under

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
it on the car but I'll have the under

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.400 
it on the car but I'll have the under
part

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
part

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.310 
part
rust-proof<00:04:07.740> I'll<00:04:08.010> get<00:04:08.190> all<00:04:08.340> underneath<00:04:08.610> here

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
rust-proof I'll get all underneath here

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.570 
rust-proof I'll get all underneath here
sanded<00:04:10.320> treated<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.490> rust-proof<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.690> then

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
sanded treated and rust-proof and then

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.750 
sanded treated and rust-proof and then
we'll<00:04:14.580> put<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.850> other<00:04:14.910> one<00:04:15.240> on<00:04:15.270> there<00:04:15.600> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
we'll put that other one on there and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.949 
we'll put that other one on there and
yeah<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:17.970> probably<00:04:18.330> going<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.510> take<00:04:18.690> me<00:04:18.930> a

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
yeah it's probably going to take me a

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.450 
yeah it's probably going to take me a
while<00:04:19.200> because<00:04:20.660> my<00:04:21.660> first<00:04:21.870> go<00:04:22.110> at<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.370> a

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
while because my first go at it but so a

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.080 
while because my first go at it but so a
couple<00:04:23.730> people<00:04:23.970> doing<00:04:24.420> it<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:25.430> feel<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.670> I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
couple people doing it and I feel that I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.990 
couple people doing it and I feel that I
got<00:04:27.480> all<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.750> stuff<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.170> needed<00:04:29.000> fairly

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
got all the stuff I needed fairly

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.700 
got all the stuff I needed fairly
cheaply<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:31.280> I'm<00:04:32.280> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> get<00:04:32.640> those<00:04:32.850> uh<00:04:32.880> I

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
cheaply and I'm going to get those uh I

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.390 
cheaply and I'm going to get those uh I
got<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.860> spot<00:04:35.070> welder<00:04:35.460> drill<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.710> I'm

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
got the spot welder drill and and I'm

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.090 
got the spot welder drill and and I'm
not<00:04:38.580> going<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.850> be<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> macho<00:04:40.290> guy<00:04:40.320> because<00:04:40.950> I'm

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
not going to be a macho guy because I'm

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.820 
not going to be a macho guy because I'm
still<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.430> my<00:04:41.880> my<00:04:42.330> mig<00:04:42.570> welders<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> flux<00:04:43.380> welder

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
still a my my mig welders a flux welder

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.160 
still a my my mig welders a flux welder
and<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.700> splatters<00:04:45.180> all<00:04:45.270> over<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.660> place<00:04:45.900> so

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
and it splatters all over the place so

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.930 
and it splatters all over the place so
I'm<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.650> get<00:04:46.800> me<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.010> spot<00:04:47.370> welder<00:04:47.760> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
I'm going to get me a spot welder and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.270 
I'm going to get me a spot welder and
I'm<00:04:48.870> going<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.050> spot<00:04:49.320> weld<00:04:49.560> everything<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:50.070> can

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
I'm going to spot weld everything I can

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
I'm going to spot weld everything I can
with<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:51.530> then<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:54.470> then<00:04:55.470> I'll<00:04:56.300> think

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
with that and then and then I'll think

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.660 
with that and then and then I'll think
about<00:04:57.480> doing<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.930> 3m<00:04:58.320> no<00:04:58.530> lead<00:04:59.240> over<00:05:00.240> here

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
about doing the 3m no lead over here

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.560 
about doing the 3m no lead over here
that's<00:05:02.670> what<00:05:02.820> I'm<00:05:02.940> probably<00:05:03.090> going<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.420> end<00:05:03.540> up

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
that's what I'm probably going to end up

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.820 
that's what I'm probably going to end up
doing<00:05:03.720> there<00:05:04.080> or<00:05:05.090> or<00:05:06.350> I'll<00:05:07.350> try<00:05:07.560> this

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
doing there or or I'll try this

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.420 
doing there or or I'll try this
MIG<00:05:08.310> weld<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:09.000> if<00:05:09.930> my<00:05:10.200> beads<00:05:10.470> go<00:05:10.770> good<00:05:11.040> then

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
MIG weld it and if my beads go good then

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.590 
MIG weld it and if my beads go good then
I'll<00:05:12.180> go<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.540> route<00:05:12.780> but<00:05:14.150> if<00:05:15.150> worst<00:05:15.420> case

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
I'll go that route but if worst case

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.090 
I'll go that route but if worst case
scenario<00:05:16.020> if<00:05:16.140> I<00:05:16.230> can't<00:05:16.470> do<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.010> I'm

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
scenario if I can't do that and I'm

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.250 
scenario if I can't do that and I'm
burning<00:05:17.670> through<00:05:17.700> and<00:05:18.060> stuff<00:05:18.330> I'm<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:19.140> to

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
burning through and stuff I'm going to

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.980 
burning through and stuff I'm going to
stop<00:05:19.530> in<00:05:19.860> a<00:05:19.980> I'll<00:05:20.850> probably<00:05:21.150> 3m<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.840> because

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
stop in a I'll probably 3m it because

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.340 
stop in a I'll probably 3m it because
that's<00:05:22.170> easy<00:05:22.590> enough<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.980> melt<00:05:23.610> down<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.210> a

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
that's easy enough to melt down and a
