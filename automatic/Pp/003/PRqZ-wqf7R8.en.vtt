styles you can try like a fun one or one

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
styles you can try like a fun one or one
that<00:00:56.730> maybe<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.090> wouldn't<00:00:57.360> necessarily<00:00:57.510> pick

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that maybe you wouldn't necessarily pick

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
that maybe you wouldn't necessarily pick
you<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> store<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.690> know

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you know up at the store but you know

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.939 
you know up at the store but you know

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
you try it on it makes a little

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.470

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
difference

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
difference

a wider feel because I have kind of a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.660 
a wider feel because I have kind of a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
wide face the cast I picked these

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.100

blue<00:02:49.330> frames<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.810> thought<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> gave<00:02:50.410> like

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
blue frames I thought that it gave like

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.759 
blue frames I thought that it gave like
a<00:02:50.739> cool<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.100> accent<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.170> next<00:02:53.380> classes
