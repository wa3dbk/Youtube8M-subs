about trying to see your value as much

about trying to see your value as much
as<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.039> women<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.490> know<00:00:11.520> to<00:00:11.730> your<00:00:12.030> value<00:00:12.449> and

ah<00:00:17.089> I<00:00:18.089> just<00:00:18.390> felt<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.250> kind<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.400> energy<00:00:20.670> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
ah I just felt this kind of energy that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.990 
ah I just felt this kind of energy that
was<00:00:21.179> really<00:00:21.839> draining<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.339> realized<00:00:23.849> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
was really draining and I realized that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
was really draining and I realized that
in<00:00:24.330> some<00:00:24.599> ways<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.050> seemed<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.410> me<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
in some ways what it seemed to me is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.400 
in some ways what it seemed to me is
like<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.669> your<00:00:26.849> attention<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.230> this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
like that your attention is in this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.730 
like that your attention is in this
place<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.829> trying<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.759> figure<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:31.140> trying

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
place of trying to figure out or trying

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.119 
place of trying to figure out or trying
to<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.240> you<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.360> work<00:00:33.900> and<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.980> some

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
to know that you have work and in some

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.630 
to know that you have work and in some
ways<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.670> seems<00:00:35.879> like<00:00:37.160> like<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> question

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
ways it just seems like like a question

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
ways it just seems like like a question
that<00:00:38.789> can<00:00:38.940> never<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.210> answered<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.199> know<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that can never be answered you know and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
that can never be answered you know and
like<00:00:40.949> John<00:00:41.219> said<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.000> anytime<00:00:42.690> you're

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
like John said it's like anytime you're

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
like John said it's like anytime you're
trying<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.829> know<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.309> value<00:00:44.430> based<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.000> what

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
trying to know your value based on what

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
trying to know your value based on what
you're<00:00:45.239> doing<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.780> doing<00:00:45.930> you're<00:00:46.590> always

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you're doing or not doing you're always

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.849 
you're doing or not doing you're always
going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> come<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.670> short<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.269> some<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.019> I

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
going to come up short in some way and I

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to come up short in some way and I
love<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.609> energy<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.120> came<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.109> your

love the energy that came up in your
post<00:00:52.469> when<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> start<00:00:52.949> talking<00:00:53.100> about

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
post when you start talking about

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
post when you start talking about
playing<00:00:53.820> metal<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.019> through<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
playing metal it was like through the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.880 
playing metal it was like through the
page<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.850> felt<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.989> tell<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.620> excitement

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
page I felt this I tell your excitement

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.090 
page I felt this I tell your excitement
I<00:00:59.280> felt<00:00:59.609> your<00:01:00.079> pleasure<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.769> felt

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
I felt your pleasure you know I felt

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
I felt your pleasure you know I felt
you're<00:01:03.260> just<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.410> way<00:01:04.620> it<00:01:04.800> lit<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.290> my

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you're just a way it lit you up and my

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.470 
you're just a way it lit you up and my
guess<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.010> those<00:01:08.220> moments<00:01:08.460> maybe<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
guess is that in those moments maybe you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.210 
guess is that in those moments maybe you
even<00:01:09.570> said<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.230> there's<00:01:10.410> no<00:01:10.560> question

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
even said this but there's no question

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
even said this but there's no question
of<00:01:11.430> work<00:01:11.730> in<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.240> moments<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:12.810> you're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
of work in those moments when you're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
of work in those moments when you're
truly<00:01:13.230> enjoying<00:01:13.770> yourselves<00:01:14.160> and<00:01:14.460> really

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
truly enjoying yourselves and really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.930 
truly enjoying yourselves and really
just<00:01:15.330> living<00:01:15.870> life<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:17.880> would

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
just living life so one thing I would

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.060 
just living life so one thing I would
recommend<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.410> know<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.800> stepping

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
recommend is you know kind of stepping

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
recommend is you know kind of stepping
outside<00:01:20.370> of<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.790> question<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> have

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
outside of that question of do I have

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.460 
outside of that question of do I have
worth<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.190> not<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.960> following

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
worth or not and actually just following

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
worth or not and actually just following
through<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.860> maybe<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> aligned<00:01:27.480> with

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
through and maybe this is aligned with

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.970 
through and maybe this is aligned with
integrity<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.260> think<00:01:28.620> that<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.890> know

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
integrity I think that you know

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.920 
integrity I think that you know
following<00:01:29.340> through<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.760> what's<00:01:29.970> true<00:01:30.480> for<00:01:30.510> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
following through on what's true for you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.130 
following through on what's true for you
what<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.010> value<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.760> love<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.540> then

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
what you value what you love and then

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
what you value what you love and then
you're<00:01:34.290> living<00:01:34.800> in<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.420> feel

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you're living in a way that you feel

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
you're living in a way that you feel
great<00:01:37.050> about<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.610> know

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
great about and then you know

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
great about and then you know
inadvertently<00:01:39.480> it's<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.080> oh<00:01:42.410> there's<00:01:43.410> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
inadvertently it's like oh there's a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
inadvertently it's like oh there's a
worse<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.550> starts<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.940> sink<00:01:45.150> into

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
worse that I think starts to sink into

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.080 
worse that I think starts to sink into
your<00:01:45.420> bone<00:01:45.980> because<00:01:46.980> not<00:01:47.550> because<00:01:47.760> of<00:01:47.910> what

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
your bone because not because of what

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.810 
your bone because not because of what
you're<00:01:48.330> doing<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:50.520> being

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you're doing but because of you being

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.000 
you're doing but because of you being
yourself<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.900> and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
yourself right and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.360 
yourself right and
respecting<00:01:54.010> yourself<00:01:54.760> because<00:01:55.660> you're<00:01:55.990> on

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
respecting yourself because you're on

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670 
respecting yourself because you're on
the<00:01:57.370> path<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.640> feels<00:01:58.180> most<00:01:58.900> online<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.530> you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
the path that feels most online to you

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.010 
the path that feels most online to you
so<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.970> don't<00:02:01.180> know<00:02:01.240> if<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.390> specifically

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
so I don't know if I specifically

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.960 
so I don't know if I specifically
answered<00:02:02.440> your<00:02:02.560> question<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.100> that's<00:02:03.760> the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
answered your question but that's the
