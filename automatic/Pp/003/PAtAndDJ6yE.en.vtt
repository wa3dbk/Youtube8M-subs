a<00:02:30.490> little<00:02:30.640> floaty<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.270> found<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.900> okay

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
a little floaty I found it okay

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.280 
a little floaty I found it okay
it<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.310> quite<00:02:33.670> speedy<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.569> game<00:02:34.750> can<00:02:35.050> get

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it is quite speedy the game can get

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.710 
it is quite speedy the game can get
quite<00:02:35.590> fast<00:02:35.920> especially<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.850> Spin<00:02:37.180> Dash<00:02:37.210> and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
quite fast especially the Spin Dash and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.160 
quite fast especially the Spin Dash and
moves<00:02:38.680> wise<00:02:39.100> seems<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.000> Sonic<00:02:40.330> only<00:02:40.600> has<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
moves wise seems that Sonic only has the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.410 
moves wise seems that Sonic only has the
Spin<00:02:41.410> Dash<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.920> everyone<00:02:42.700> else<00:02:42.910> has<00:02:43.180> the

stages you get in the demo consists of
this<00:02:56.069> one<00:02:56.310> which<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> standard<00:02:57.330> get<00:02:57.569> from

this one which is a standard get from

this one which is a standard get from
start<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.230> finish<00:02:58.260> level<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:59.069> level<00:02:59.790> where<00:02:59.940> you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
start to finish level a level where you

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.270 
start to finish level a level where you
must<00:03:00.270> destroy<00:03:00.750> all<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.319> bad<00:03:01.560> necks<00:03:01.890> although

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
must destroy all the bad necks although

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.040 
must destroy all the bad necks although
I've<00:03:02.580> always<00:03:02.790> been<00:03:03.000> pretty<00:03:03.300> terrible<00:03:03.930> at

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
I've always been pretty terrible at

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.870 
I've always been pretty terrible at
these<00:03:04.200> stages<00:03:04.530> because<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.130> tend<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.700> like

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
these stages because I tend to like

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.660 
these stages because I tend to like
abusing<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.170> invincibility<00:03:07.800> time<00:03:08.280> after

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
abusing the invincibility time after

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.460 
abusing the invincibility time after
I've<00:03:08.760> been<00:03:08.819> hit<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.020> level<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.440> no

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
I've been hit and with the level with no

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
I've been hit and with the level with no
rings<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.340> lots<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.700> enemies<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.300> can't<00:03:12.630> really

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
rings and lots of enemies I can't really

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.350 
rings and lots of enemies I can't really
do<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> one's<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.670> bit<00:03:14.819> challenging

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
do that so this one's a bit challenging

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.380 
do that so this one's a bit challenging
for<00:03:15.569> me<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:17.280> level<00:03:17.760> where<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.060> to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
for me and the level where you have to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.320 
for me and the level where you have to
be<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.750> me<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.319> finish<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> race<00:03:20.330> easier

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
be a me to the finish and a race easier

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.120 
be a me to the finish and a race easier
said<00:03:21.600> than<00:03:21.750> done<00:03:21.810> on<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.230> first<00:03:22.470> take<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.100> I

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
said than done on the first take but I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.460 
said than done on the first take but I
did<00:03:23.459> manage<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.630> end<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
did manage to do it in the end so the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.110 
did manage to do it in the end so the
demo<00:03:25.800> has<00:03:25.920> got<00:03:26.130> quite<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.370> few<00:03:26.580> things<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.000> can

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
demo has got quite a few things you can

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.570 
demo has got quite a few things you can
try<00:03:27.420> out<00:03:27.599> mess<00:03:28.019> with<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.830> get<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.010> feel<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.250> how

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
try out mess with to get a feel of how

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.009 
try out mess with to get a feel of how
the<00:03:29.640> rest<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> game<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.420> probably<00:03:30.660> gonna

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
the rest of the game is probably gonna

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.890 
the rest of the game is probably gonna
play<00:03:31.319> out<00:03:31.530> also<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.489> must<00:03:32.760> say<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.510> level

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
play out also I must say that the level

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.140 
play out also I must say that the level
design<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.260> looking<00:03:34.830> pretty<00:03:35.130> decent<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:35.940> well

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
design is looking pretty decent as well

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.570 
design is looking pretty decent as well
as<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> artwork<00:03:36.900> as<00:03:37.140> well<00:03:37.190> for<00:03:38.190> each<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.489> the

the band next level there are different

branching paths allowing you to take

branching paths allowing you to take

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
majority of the stage but going back a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.150 
majority of the stage but going back a
little<00:03:54.810> bit<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.230> then<00:03:55.380> take<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.799> upper<00:03:56.130> part

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
little bit to then take the upper part

little bit to then take the upper part
you<00:03:56.549> rarely<00:03:56.880> see<00:03:57.060> water<00:03:57.540> through<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.019> entire

thing taking the upper route on this

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.420 
thing taking the upper route on this
stage<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.230> allow<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.650> probably<00:04:02.160> take

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
stage will allow you to probably take

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.460 
stage will allow you to probably take
the<00:04:02.609> quickest<00:04:03.030> route<00:04:03.299> but<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.019> should<00:04:04.230> take

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
the quickest route but you should take
