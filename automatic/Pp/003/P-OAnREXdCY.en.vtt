00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
show you this always turning over once

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
show you this always turning over once
because<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.540> where<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.900> bolt<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
because that's where the bolt is and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
because that's where the bolt is and
it'll<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.520> shield<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.210> his<00:01:06.300> piece<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it'll be shield about his piece of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
it'll be shield about his piece of
plastic<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> got<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.560> bolt<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
plastic we got to take that bolt out and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.440 
plastic we got to take that bolt out and
slide<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.640> off<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:10.440> why<00:01:11.000> I'd<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
slide this off so that's why I'd turn it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
slide this off so that's why I'd turn it
over<00:01:12.540> once

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.069
