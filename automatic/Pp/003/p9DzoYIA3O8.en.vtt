 hello to all this Thursday the INSEE well as 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.619
 you could see on the fan page 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.660
 I had proposed to you to make a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.230
 very basic minecraft tracking adventure of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.359
 survival will be tied to the other end 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 but hey that's how, but I have two 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 little girls but because I had 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.680
 a little fed up I showed him second 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.739
 mpenza hoodie an interview that prevents 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 no here we are here this is a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.920
 very small part that I started 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.899
 all alone but so I'm doing an adventure 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.719
 follow savard who will be called karoui 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.590
 kraft so that's going to happen in a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.320
 totally cabrel universe like you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.710
 can you guess 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.730
 so I play at a point 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 7.2 so the very latest version of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.430
 minecraft there will be no fashion because 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:12.689
 that I did not sleep in fashion and play 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 currently but so that's going to have to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.770
 the imagination to try different x 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.560
 factor so now I have some 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.479
 small goals that I'm going to have 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.950
 to follow 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.729
 I certainly would put description 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.729
 of the episode 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.950
 and other actions I also have in the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.050
 head forward on so this site an episode 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.190
 zero simply to explain 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.290
 how's it going to be so I'm going 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.310
 follow a goal that I will tell you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.640
 in episode 1 I do not know how I 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.880
 are going to be producing because 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.630
 few scenarios 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 so here it is here me here so what 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.180
 that I'm going to do so we shut up saying that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.369
 the party is going slow to continue 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680
 So you put green thumbs 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.729

 goals without can be everything and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.920
 anything too from construction 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.170
 that by the construction 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.260
 Now these are not no guides 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.480
 stuff too limes for me there I 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.390
 will take what nothing personally I 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.670

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.690

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.709

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.880
 more game because youtube 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 operation simply made known 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.120
 that if a goal is someone post 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.160
 please you once to comment 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 before the goal in question in time 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.799
 I leave you I'll react to that for 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.450
 finally that I can see that we 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.959
 so please maybe realize this 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.000
 goal 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:57.150
 so here I think it's a bit 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.440
 near oujda that you just tell that 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.530
 I do not really need this 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.910
 that it already comes it's totally folds 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.150
 style I had to give a little 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.500
 idea but here it is bah voila I know 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.700
 not when I'm going to start that I 'm going 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:19.050
 again in relation to your reactions 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.980
 here I hope I'm not going to m 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.680
 because there you say but he is there 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.950
 I read you we it is normal that 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.260
 minecraft him it would have to put our 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.599
 texture pack of course no doubt and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.989
 so the cgil explains a little the beats 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.900
 austin rhymes of this adventure 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.950
 so here we go, so here I am, I think 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.530
 that's it for this very short 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.810
 video so a passerby has small 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.340
 worries to all 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:52.769
 one full full full full full full 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.769
 full flow all and with a small
