stops mine from rolling and that is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
stops mine from rolling and that is
actually<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.509> defect<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> other<00:01:47.310> side

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
actually a defect see on the other side

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.179 
actually a defect see on the other side
there's<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.140> not<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.680> poking<00:01:50.070> out

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there's just not that little poking out

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.490 
there's just not that little poking out
part<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.610> super<00:01:51.090> small<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:52.290> just

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
part that's super small and that's just

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
part that's super small and that's just
because<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.860> metal<00:01:53.070> pin<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> holds<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
because the metal pin that holds this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.510 
because the metal pin that holds this
thing<00:01:54.659> together<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.259> pokes<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.710> slightly

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
thing together just pokes out slightly

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
thing together just pokes out slightly
further<00:01:56.969> than<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.360> should<00:01:57.740> that's<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
further than it should that's a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.399 
further than it should that's a
different<00:01:58.979> matter<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.520> while<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:01.049> may<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.350> be

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
different matter and while it may not be

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
different matter and while it may not be

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
this one's great I feel the opposite but

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.259 
this one's great I feel the opposite but
this<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.470> still<00:02:26.709> good<00:02:26.890> figure<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.430> don't<00:02:28.209> like

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
this is still good figure I don't like

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.790 
this is still good figure I don't like
the<00:02:28.480> front<00:02:28.690> wheels<00:02:28.900> though<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> mean<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.590> know

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
the front wheels though I mean I know

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.729 
the front wheels though I mean I know
they<00:02:30.069> had<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.430> something<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.410> wish<00:02:32.590> they

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
they had to do something but I wish they

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.610 
they had to do something but I wish they
had<00:02:32.860> done<00:02:33.099> just<00:02:33.400> more<00:02:33.580> treads<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.360> maybe<00:02:35.349> one

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
had done just more treads and maybe one

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.250 
had done just more treads and maybe one
of<00:02:35.650> these<00:02:35.800> little<00:02:35.950> small<00:02:36.790> wheels<00:02:37.200> instead<00:02:38.200> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of these little small wheels instead of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.839 
of these little small wheels instead of
this<00:02:38.500> big<00:02:38.830> tank<00:02:39.220> thing<00:02:39.459> because<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.670> looks

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
this big tank thing because that looks

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.300 
this big tank thing because that looks
ugly<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> mean<00:02:40.690> it's<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> car<00:02:42.069> on<00:02:42.280> the

weapons and then voyager class optimus

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.569 
weapons and then voyager class optimus
prime's<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:44.859> bothers<00:03:45.190> me<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.400> little

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
prime's so that bothers me a little

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
because none of them are mechtech

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.509 
because none of them are mechtech
compatible<00:03:47.530> then<00:03:47.650> because<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.160> colors

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
compatible then because of the colors

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.949

the same shade as the hand
and<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.940> bothers<00:04:18.299> me<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> little<00:04:18.959> because<00:04:19.199> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
and that bothers me a little because the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.370 
and that bothers me a little because the
light<00:04:19.739> purple<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.699> don't<00:04:21.509> know<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.840> don't<00:04:22.259> think

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
light purple I don't know I don't think

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.080 
light purple I don't know I don't think
it<00:04:22.560> works<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:22.979> this<00:04:23.070> figure<00:04:23.310> completely<00:04:24.060> i

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
it works for this figure completely i

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.939 
it works for this figure completely i
would<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.449> liked<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:25.020> metallic<00:04:25.470> grey<00:04:25.710> like

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
would have liked the metallic grey like

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.090 
would have liked the metallic grey like
the<00:04:26.070> rest<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.400> them<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:27.449> whatever

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
the rest of them but whatever

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.540 
the rest of them but whatever
light-piping<00:04:29.100> wise<00:04:30.560> really<00:04:31.560> extremely<00:04:32.190> red

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
light-piping wise really extremely red

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.180 
light-piping wise really extremely red
and<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.960> bothers<00:04:34.320> me<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.830> little<00:04:34.860> bit<00:04:35.070> i

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
and that bothers me just a little bit i

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.800 
and that bothers me just a little bit i
mean<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.550> great<00:04:35.729> light-piping<00:04:36.180> no<00:04:36.600> doubt

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
mean it's great light-piping no doubt

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.080 
mean it's great light-piping no doubt
but<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.039> only<00:04:38.070> figure<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.699> wished

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
but this is the only figure I wished

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.480 
but this is the only figure I wished
didn't<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.199> light<00:04:40.410> piping<00:04:40.889> because

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
didn't have the light piping because

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.840 
didn't have the light piping because
dull<00:04:41.820> colors<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.509> him<00:04:42.690> are<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> lot<00:04:43.169> better<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:44.430> I

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
dull colors on him are a lot better so I

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.400 
dull colors on him are a lot better so I
mean<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.419> would<00:04:45.570> have<00:04:45.660> been<00:04:45.720> great<00:04:45.900> if<00:04:45.990> Optimus

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
mean it would have been great if Optimus

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.070 
mean it would have been great if Optimus
Prime<00:04:46.860> at<00:04:47.100> great<00:04:47.370> light-piping<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.330> nope

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
Prime at great light-piping but nope

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.089 
Prime at great light-piping but nope
this<00:04:49.289> guy<00:04:49.470> got<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.860> uh<00:04:50.720> spin<00:04:51.720> him<00:04:51.840> around<00:04:52.099> it's

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
this guy got it uh spin him around it's

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.650 
this guy got it uh spin him around it's
got<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.250> backpack<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.910> I've<00:04:54.240> accidentally

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
got a backpack that I've accidentally

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.510 
got a backpack that I've accidentally
deformed<00:04:55.970> it's<00:04:56.970> cool<00:04:57.270> again<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.080> uh<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:59.190> habit

deformed it's cool again I uh that habit
but<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.180> really<00:05:00.810> do<00:05:00.960> not<00:05:01.110> wish<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.680> these<00:05:02.220> were

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
but I really do not wish that these were

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.610 
but I really do not wish that these were
the<00:05:02.550> wheels<00:05:02.759> I<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.599> just<00:05:03.660> doesn't<00:05:04.380> feel<00:05:04.560> right

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
the wheels I it just doesn't feel right

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.230 
the wheels I it just doesn't feel right
when<00:05:04.979> you<00:05:05.070> transform<00:05:05.580> him<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:05.970> all<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.180> a

when you transform him and all of a
sudden<00:05:06.270> his<00:05:07.139> backpack<00:05:07.770> fuel<00:05:08.130> cells<00:05:08.520> are

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
sudden his backpack fuel cells are

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.689 
sudden his backpack fuel cells are
moving<00:05:10.229> him<00:05:10.349> across<00:05:10.620> terrain<00:05:11.250> it<00:05:11.520> just

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
moving him across terrain it just

and<00:05:36.930> what<00:05:37.470> bothers<00:05:37.770> me<00:05:37.800> about<00:05:37.949> that<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.729> on<00:05:39.060> his

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
and what bothers me about that is on his

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.800 
and what bothers me about that is on his
bio<00:05:39.599> he's<00:05:40.050> act<00:05:40.289> a<00:05:40.500> popped<00:05:41.190> out<00:05:41.400> but<00:05:42.330> he<00:05:42.780> is

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
bio he's act a popped out but he is

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.500 
bio he's act a popped out but he is
technically<00:05:43.500> inning<00:05:44.280> not<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.699> bio<00:05:45.060> for<00:05:45.300> the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
technically inning not the bio for the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.770 
technically inning not the bio for the
toy<00:05:45.810> but<00:05:46.169> in<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:47.610> shockwave<00:05:48.060> bio<00:05:48.330> of

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
toy but in like the shockwave bio of

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.439 
toy but in like the shockwave bio of
himself<00:05:49.639> he's<00:05:50.639> actually<00:05:50.880> supposed<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.389> be

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
himself he's actually supposed to be

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.170 
himself he's actually supposed to be
taller<00:05:51.780> than<00:05:51.960> Optimus<00:05:52.530> Prime<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.159> because<00:05:54.150> of

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
taller than Optimus Prime and because of

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.960 
taller than Optimus Prime and because of
this<00:05:54.389> cubby<00:05:54.870> head<00:05:55.020> design<00:05:55.520> he<00:05:56.520> is<00:05:56.699> actually

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
this cubby head design he is actually

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.110 
this cubby head design he is actually
shorter<00:05:57.750> by<00:05:58.169> just<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.620> little<00:05:58.979> bit<00:05:59.159> so<00:06:00.090> that

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
shorter by just a little bit so that

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.210 
shorter by just a little bit so that
that's<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:00.780> design<00:06:01.110> flaw<00:06:01.380> in<00:06:01.530> my<00:06:01.650> opinion<00:06:01.919> but

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
that's a design flaw in my opinion but

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.330 
that's a design flaw in my opinion but
he<00:06:03.180> makes<00:06:03.360> up<00:06:03.509> for<00:06:03.690> that<00:06:03.720> with<00:06:04.199> giant<00:06:05.159> mega

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
he makes up for that with giant mega

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.600 
he makes up for that with giant mega
cannon<00:06:05.669> that<00:06:05.940> locks<00:06:06.180> out<00:06:07.280> which<00:06:08.280> I<00:06:08.460> will

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
cannon that locks out which I will

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.980 
cannon that locks out which I will
unlock<00:06:08.909> right<00:06:09.210> now<00:06:09.330> just<00:06:09.539> so<00:06:09.630> you<00:06:09.720> see<00:06:09.810> the

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
unlock right now just so you see the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.640 
unlock right now just so you see the

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
normal kind or maybe not maybe it will

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.830 
normal kind or maybe not maybe it will
