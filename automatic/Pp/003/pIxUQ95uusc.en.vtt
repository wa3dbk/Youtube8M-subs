we're going to be drawing that lovable
space<00:00:13.860> goat<00:00:14.130> known<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.700> Yoda<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.839> getting

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
space goat known as Yoda so getting

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.140 
space goat known as Yoda so getting
started<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.770> usual<00:00:17.279> we'll<00:00:17.430> begin<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
started as usual we'll begin with the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.050 
started as usual we'll begin with the
construction<00:00:19.020> lines<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.550> drawing<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
construction lines and we're drawing a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.490 
construction lines and we're drawing a
figure<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.510> something<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.990> looks<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
figure of something that looks in the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200 
figure of something that looks in the
beginning<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.070> little<00:00:23.400> bit<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> hunchback

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
beginning a little bit like a hunchback

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
beginning a little bit like a hunchback
old<00:00:24.630> lady<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.560> big<00:00:25.769> ears

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
old lady with big ears

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.390 
old lady with big ears
so<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.539> further<00:00:27.930> refine<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> shape<00:00:28.710> adding

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
so as we further refine the shape adding

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
so as we further refine the shape adding
things<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.179> front<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.840> arm<00:00:31.109> reaching

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
things like the front right arm reaching

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.650 
things like the front right arm reaching
forward<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.489> keep<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.820> mind<00:00:32.850> things<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.390> for

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
forward we keep in mind things like for

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
forward we keep in mind things like for
shortening<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> cloak

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
shortening and as well with the cloak

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
shortening and as well with the cloak
things<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> cloth<00:00:37.079> hangs<00:00:37.440> with

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
things like how the cloth hangs with

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
things like how the cloth hangs with
motion<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.730> I've<00:00:38.850> done<00:00:39.090> tutorials<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.780> both

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
motion so I've done tutorials on both

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
motion so I've done tutorials on both
for<00:00:40.290> shortening<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.920> cloth<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.910> clothing<00:00:42.210> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
for shortening and cloth and clothing so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
for shortening and cloth and clothing so
make<00:00:42.989> sure<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> check<00:00:43.440> those<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.860> otherwise

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
make sure to check those out otherwise

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
make sure to check those out otherwise
proceeding<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> image<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.289> thing

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
proceeding with the image one thing

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
proceeding with the image one thing
that's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.100> tricky<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:48.090> doing<00:00:48.480> something

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that's a bit tricky in doing something

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
that's a bit tricky in doing something
like<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.309> fact<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.640> all

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
like this is the fact that all

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
like this is the fact that all
portrayals<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> character<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.559> most<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
portrayals of this character or most of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.560 
portrayals of this character or most of
them<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.570> puppets<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.230> CG<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.360> with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
them are with puppets or CG and so with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.400 
them are with puppets or CG and so with
doing<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.140> cartoon<00:00:58.949> version<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.109> kind

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
doing a cartoon version of that you kind

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
doing a cartoon version of that you kind
of<00:01:01.500> got<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> pick<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> things<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.850> accentuate

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
of got to pick the things to accentuate

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
of got to pick the things to accentuate
to<00:01:04.049> try<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.500> portray<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:05.489> you're<00:01:05.610> getting

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to try and portray what you're getting

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
to try and portray what you're getting
across<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.689> without<00:01:07.680> overdoing<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
across and so without overdoing it you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
across and so without overdoing it you
don't<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> use<00:01:09.360> too<00:01:09.390> many<00:01:09.810> lines<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
don't want to use too many lines you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.899 
don't want to use too many lines you
know<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:10.830> too<00:01:11.100> many<00:01:11.250> colors<00:01:11.610> or

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
know I want to use too many colors or

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.320 
know I want to use too many colors or

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
shades but you do want to create a
caricature<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:15.960> something<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:16.979> what

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
caricature or something so we know what

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
caricature or something so we know what
is<00:01:17.369> being<00:01:17.610> represented<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.170> particular

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
is being represented so in particular

with the shape in Yoda's face

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
with the shape in Yoda's face
accentuating<00:01:23.310> things<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> under<00:01:24.439> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
accentuating things like the under the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.410 
accentuating things like the under the
under<00:01:25.740> bags<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> eyes<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.150> upper

under bags of the eyes and the upper
eyelids<00:01:27.810> being<00:01:28.049> mostly<00:01:28.590> closed<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.070> it's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
eyelids being mostly closed because it's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.120 
eyelids being mostly closed because it's
quite<00:01:29.490> old<00:01:29.960> as<00:01:30.960> well<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.350> those<00:01:31.500> ridges<00:01:31.979> along

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
quite old as well as those ridges along

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.560 
quite old as well as those ridges along
the<00:01:32.400> top<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> his<00:01:32.820> head<00:01:33.000> they're<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> very

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the top of his head they're a very

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
the top of his head they're a very
defining<00:01:34.110> feature<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> did<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
defining feature as you can see I did a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.370 
defining feature as you can see I did a
bit<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> mock<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.479> his<00:01:36.600> hair<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
bit of a mock up with his hair it was a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.280 
bit of a mock up with his hair it was a
bit<00:01:37.560> too<00:01:37.770> full<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.540> rather<00:01:39.900> than<00:01:40.110> doing

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
bit too full and so rather than doing

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.380 
bit too full and so rather than doing
that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.500> did<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.490> ragged

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that I did a little bit more ragged

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.370 
that I did a little bit more ragged
wispy<00:01:43.460> segments<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.579> hair<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:45.990> true

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
wispy segments of hair to be more true

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
wispy segments of hair to be more true
to<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> original<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> CG<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.299> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to the original because in the CG and in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
to the original because in the CG and in
the<00:01:48.450> puppet<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.140> are<00:01:49.350> quite<00:01:49.649> transparent

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the puppet they are quite transparent

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
the puppet they are quite transparent
and<00:01:50.549> they're<00:01:50.700> wisps<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.990> mean<00:01:52.680> without

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and they're wisps but I mean without

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
and they're wisps but I mean without
being<00:01:53.130> too<00:01:53.700> complicated<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.360> detailed<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
being too complicated or detailed it's a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.170 
being too complicated or detailed it's a
bit<00:01:55.259> more<00:01:55.680> tricky<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:57.149> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
bit more tricky to do that with a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
bit more tricky to do that with a
cartoon<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.899> line<00:01:58.170> work<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
cartoon and with line work so that's the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.840 
cartoon and with line work so that's the
conclusion<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.420> ended<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.960> with

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
conclusion that I ended up going with

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.399 
conclusion that I ended up going with
moving<00:02:02.850> along<00:02:03.090> basically<00:02:03.990> everything<00:02:04.380> from

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
moving along basically everything from

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.260 
moving along basically everything from
here<00:02:04.740> follows<00:02:05.100> along<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> construction

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
here follows along what the construction

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.469 
here follows along what the construction
lines<00:02:06.509> were<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.030> refinement<00:02:09.030> keeping

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
lines were just with refinement keeping

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.990 
lines were just with refinement keeping
up<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.660> keeping<00:02:10.470> things<00:02:10.739> nice<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.099> neat<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
up so keeping things nice and neat and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.580 
up so keeping things nice and neat and
I'm<00:02:13.090> sure<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.570> line<00:02:13.720> weight<00:02:13.900> variations

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I'm sure that the line weight variations

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.980 
I'm sure that the line weight variations
are<00:02:14.770> focused<00:02:15.100> on<00:02:15.220> properly<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.690> now<00:02:16.810> when

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
are focused on properly and now when

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.390 
are focused on properly and now when
getting<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.440> light<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.010> I'm<00:02:18.160> not

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
getting to the light so but I'm not

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.300 
getting to the light so but I'm not
going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> draw<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.840> laser<00:02:20.530> II<00:02:20.710> bit<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
going to draw the laser II bit of the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.740 
going to draw the laser II bit of the
lightsaber<00:02:21.670> I'm<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.090> leave<00:02:22.210> that<00:02:22.420> till

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
lightsaber I'm going to leave that till

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.330 
lightsaber I'm going to leave that till
after<00:02:22.900> I've<00:02:23.230> colored<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> image<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.100> can

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
after I've colored the image so you can

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.820 
after I've colored the image so you can
see<00:02:24.610> how<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.570> make<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.170> look<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> real

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
see how I make it look like a real

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.830 
see how I make it look like a real
lightsaber<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.120> first<00:02:28.330> thing<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.570> do<00:02:28.630> when

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
lightsaber so the first thing I do when

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080 
lightsaber so the first thing I do when
I<00:02:28.900> get<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.320> color<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.830> usual<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.550> shade

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
I get to the color as usual is I shade

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.690 
I get to the color as usual is I shade
in<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.870> shadows<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.680> once<00:02:32.890> I've<00:02:33.070> done<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
in the shadows and once I've done that I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.900 
in the shadows and once I've done that I
can<00:02:33.930> shade<00:02:34.930> here<00:02:35.260> sorry<00:02:35.680> not<00:02:36.100> shadyan<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.640> can

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
can shade here sorry not shadyan I can

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.870 
can shade here sorry not shadyan I can
fill<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.330> highlights<00:02:37.800> now<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.860> first<00:02:39.340> set

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
fill in the highlights now the first set

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.610 
fill in the highlights now the first set
of<00:02:40.000> colors<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.450> picked<00:02:40.750> for<00:02:40.840> his<00:02:41.020> skin<00:02:41.410> I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
of colors that I picked for his skin I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.500 
of colors that I picked for his skin I
wasn't<00:02:42.160> entirely<00:02:42.400> happy<00:02:42.640> with<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:43.390> can

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
wasn't entirely happy with so as you can

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.330 
wasn't entirely happy with so as you can
see<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.750> went<00:02:44.020> through<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.740> did<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.160> quick

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
see I went through and just did a quick

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.010 
see I went through and just did a quick
adjustment<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.970> bring<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.239> all<00:02:46.330> up<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.989> a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
adjustment to bring it all up to a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.449 
adjustment to bring it all up to a
slightly<00:02:47.350> lighter<00:02:47.620> color<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:48.220> use

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
slightly lighter color and then use

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.880 
slightly lighter color and then use
those<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.390> other<00:02:49.540> areas<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.110> skin<00:02:50.350> now

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
those in the other areas of the skin now

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.040 
those in the other areas of the skin now
the<00:02:50.950> rest<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.489> Yoda<00:02:51.880> was<00:02:52.060> fairly<00:02:52.360> simple<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.930> do

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
the rest of Yoda was fairly simple to do

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.420 
the rest of Yoda was fairly simple to do
because<00:02:53.290> they<00:02:53.530> were<00:02:53.590> all<00:02:53.800> kind<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.130> murky

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
because they were all kind of murky

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.120 
because they were all kind of murky
Browns<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.150> just<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.810> know<00:02:55.920> outlining<00:02:56.920> where

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
Browns and just you know outlining where

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.560 
Browns and just you know outlining where
the<00:02:57.250> shadows<00:02:57.550> go<00:02:57.760> filling<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
the shadows go filling in with the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.060 
the shadows go filling in with the
highlights<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.110> then<00:02:59.260> moving<00:02:59.470> on<00:02:59.680> from<00:02:59.709> there

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
highlights and then moving on from there

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.460 
highlights and then moving on from there
and<00:03:00.880> then<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.239> very<00:03:01.480> last<00:03:01.570> thing<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.290> did

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
and then the very last thing that I did

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.580 
and then the very last thing that I did
after<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.280> course<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.610> finished<00:03:04.000> my<00:03:04.150> shading

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
after of course I finished my shading

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.260 
after of course I finished my shading
was<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.770> lightsaber<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.880> do<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
was the lightsaber now to do the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.670 
was the lightsaber now to do the
lightsabers<00:03:07.810> you'll<00:03:07.989> see<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.290> moment<00:03:08.410> I

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
lightsabers you'll see in a moment I

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.670 
lightsabers you'll see in a moment I
first<00:03:09.370> created<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> shape<00:03:10.270> with<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:11.020> solid

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
first created the shape with a solid

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.620 
first created the shape with a solid
color<00:03:11.709> which<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.459> case<00:03:12.640> was<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> red<00:03:13.150> then

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
color which in this case was a red then

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.660 
color which in this case was a red then
I<00:03:13.959> put<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.440> put<00:03:14.620> into<00:03:14.860> position<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.459> made

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
I put it in put into position and I made

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.539 
I put it in put into position and I made
it<00:03:15.790> white<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:17.440> Adobe<00:03:17.860> Flash<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.220> turned<00:03:18.430> it

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
it white and in Adobe Flash I turned it

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.940 
it white and in Adobe Flash I turned it
into<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.760> movie<00:03:18.940> clip<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.750> could<00:03:20.170> add<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.410> glow

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
into a movie clip so I could add a glow

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.890 
into a movie clip so I could add a glow
but<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.580> general<00:03:22.090> when<00:03:22.209> doing<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.570> glowy<00:03:22.780> effect

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
but in general when doing a glowy effect

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.780 
but in general when doing a glowy effect
like<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.470> rather<00:03:23.950> than<00:03:24.250> having<00:03:24.459> color

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
like that rather than having color

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.759 
like that rather than having color
within<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.690> shape<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.320> thing<00:03:26.500> itself

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
within the the shape of the thing itself
