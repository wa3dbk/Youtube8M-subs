00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
need to be doing see that the group out

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.969 
need to be doing see that the group out
my<00:01:11.700> days<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.630> group<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.960> wins<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
squad if we win the group then we're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
squad if we win the group then we're
doing<00:01:19.350> something<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.549> the

something's right but let's just say we

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.560 
something's right but let's just say we
had<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.290> worst<00:01:28.590> possible<00:01:29.460> start<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
had the worst possible start to this

had the worst possible start to this
first<00:01:30.840> half<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.200> mean<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.619> even<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.860> how

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
first half I mean I don't even know how

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
first half I mean I don't even know how
to<00:01:32.009> ref<00:01:32.280> call<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> penalty<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.360> he<00:01:33.450> did

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to ref call the penalty there but he did

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.420

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
down to no end away from home so at this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.830 
down to no end away from home so at this
point<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.850> damn<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> guess<00:01:51.479> second

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
point I was like damn I guess second

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.179 
point I was like damn I guess second
place<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.140> gonna<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.920> group

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
place is gonna have to do in this group

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
place is gonna have to do in this group
I<00:01:53.310> guess<00:01:53.460> second<00:01:53.820> place<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.149> good<00:01:54.329> enough<00:01:54.509> from

I guess second place is good enough from

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.899 
I guess second place is good enough from
the<00:01:54.780> 23rd<00:01:55.290> minute<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.070> finally<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.520> our<00:01:56.579> first

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the 23rd minute we finally get our first

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.580 
the 23rd minute we finally get our first
chance<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.509> liver<00:01:57.689> moved<00:01:57.930> past<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> border

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
chance when liver moved past the border

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.350 
chance when liver moved past the border
to<00:01:58.860> Holtby<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.430> he's<00:01:59.700> making<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.060> move<00:02:00.210> into

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to Holtby and he's making a move into

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.999 
to Holtby and he's making a move into
the<00:02:00.479> box<00:02:00.689> nice<00:02:00.869> no<00:02:00.990> fake<00:02:01.200> shot<00:02:01.380> cuts<00:02:01.560> back<00:02:01.680> he's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the box nice no fake shot cuts back he's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.179 
the box nice no fake shot cuts back he's
in<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:03.049> unlucky<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.710> went<00:02:04.920> wide

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
in there unlucky that one just went wide

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.319 
in there unlucky that one just went wide
and<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> thought<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.850> should<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.180> been<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and I thought that should have been a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.880 
and I thought that should have been a
goal<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:06.840> why<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:07.290> doesn't<00:02:07.619> start

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
goal and that's why he doesn't start

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
goal and that's why he doesn't start
from<00:02:08.069> me<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> he's<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> bit

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
from me because I he's a bit

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.320 
from me because I he's a bit
disappointing<00:02:09.629> when<00:02:09.750> he<00:02:09.810> does

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
disappointing when he does

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.970 
disappointing when he does
a lot<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.050> players<00:02:11.410> would<00:02:11.740> have<00:02:11.860> finished
