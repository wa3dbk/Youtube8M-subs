00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.250
 in the current convent 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 e for the game by acting in c 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.200
 not in simple morán return 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 the friendly bar for starting against an opponent 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.170
 at the same level as the approach 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.750
 alarcón declare by him the reception to receive the heat of the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 plenary 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.480
 but white 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.649
 It has not been very good 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.649
 for them the teaching centers 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.259
 with the sweet computation these are very easy 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.289
 and this hand is the other two points not here 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.319
 I still lack a lot of commitment before 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.169
 iu demands 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.739
 d this spirit 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.789
 who knows very well 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.649
 I believe that 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.889
 what can we be satisfied with this first 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.589
 essay 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.589
 match that closes 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.930
 very worthy pre-season phase where a lot of work has been done 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.269
 all right 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.279
 we had 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.429
 good feelings on the court 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.429
 of unt 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.109
 different quintets combinations different ways of playing different 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.529
 again 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.690
 moss everything well 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.260
 a lot of work for a job that we will have to do in principle by playing 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.139
 because we will have more friendly training 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.139
 %%% 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.569
 after the match 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.509
 easier we have all started very well 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.209
 the match was extremely new 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.449
 for example
