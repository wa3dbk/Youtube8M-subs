00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.289 
near as good as the Astros were and the
mic<00:02:35.620> was<00:02:35.859> really<00:02:36.129> bad<00:02:36.370> people<00:02:36.730> were<00:02:36.939> hearing<00:02:37.209> a

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
mic was really bad people were hearing a

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.390 
mic was really bad people were hearing a
lot<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.450> echo<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.200> things<00:02:38.409> like<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.680> no<00:02:39.099> even

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
lot of echo and things like that no even

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.309 
lot of echo and things like that no even
if<00:02:39.459> i<00:02:39.549> had<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.730> game<00:02:40.000> volume<00:02:40.239> turned<00:02:40.689> down<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
if i had the game volume turned down and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.930 
if i had the game volume turned down and
they<00:02:42.250> were<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:42.819> really<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.930> great<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
they were just not really that great it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.369 
they were just not really that great it
was<00:02:46.269> unfortunate<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:47.079> they<00:02:47.319> were

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
was unfortunate because they were

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.930 
was unfortunate because they were
actually<00:02:47.829> quite<00:02:47.889> a<00:02:47.980> bit<00:02:48.129> cheaper<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.519> Astros

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
actually quite a bit cheaper the Astros

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.539 
actually quite a bit cheaper the Astros
are<00:02:49.180> quite<00:02:50.139> expensive<00:02:50.609> but<00:02:51.609> well<00:02:52.150> worth<00:02:52.389> it<00:02:52.599> I

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
are quite expensive but well worth it I

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.309 
are quite expensive but well worth it I
didn't<00:02:54.549> really<00:02:54.879> give<00:02:55.239> turtle<00:02:55.629> beaches<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.079> try

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
didn't really give turtle beaches to try

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.729 
didn't really give turtle beaches to try
just<00:02:56.709> because<00:02:57.069> after<00:02:57.519> my<00:02:57.989> experience<00:02:58.989> with

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
just because after my experience with

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.069 
just because after my experience with
the<00:02:59.829> a<00:02:59.859> 30s<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.639> then<00:03:00.879> going<00:03:01.359> to<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.599> Tritons

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
the a 30s and then going to the Tritons

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.089 
the a 30s and then going to the Tritons
and<00:03:02.349> just<00:03:02.909> seeing<00:03:03.909> how<00:03:04.209> big<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.720> difference

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
and just seeing how big of a difference

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.009 
and just seeing how big of a difference
the<00:03:06.099> Astros<00:03:06.609> were<00:03:06.819> as<00:03:07.030> far<00:03:07.269> as<00:03:07.389> sound<00:03:07.569> quality

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
the Astros were as far as sound quality

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.789 
the Astros were as far as sound quality
and<00:03:08.049> everything<00:03:08.470> goes<00:03:08.709> was<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.680> just

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
and everything goes was just it just

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.170 
and everything goes was just it just
didn't<00:03:12.069> seem<00:03:12.159> worth<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.579> instead<00:03:13.060> of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
didn't seem worth it I instead of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.330 
didn't seem worth it I instead of
messing<00:03:13.659> around<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.959> just<00:03:14.139> decided<00:03:14.379> you<00:03:15.250> know
