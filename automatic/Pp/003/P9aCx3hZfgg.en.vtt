00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
all right so follow-up to the video I

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.730 
all right so follow-up to the video I
shot<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.400> few<00:00:05.640> minutes<00:00:05.940> ago<00:00:06.410> you're<00:00:07.410> talking

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
shot a few minutes ago you're talking

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.770 
shot a few minutes ago you're talking
about<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.880> was<00:00:09.090> pretty<00:00:09.300> sure<00:00:09.480> one<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
about how the I was pretty sure one of

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.589 
about how the I was pretty sure one of
the<00:00:09.840> bearings<00:00:10.139> seals<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.710> squealing<00:00:11.250> well<00:00:12.120> it

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the bearings seals was squealing well it

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.919 
the bearings seals was squealing well it
would<00:00:13.049> seem<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> problem<00:00:14.700> was

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
would seem that was what the problem was

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.390 
would seem that was what the problem was
has<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.970> inside<00:00:18.420> bearing<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:19.740> okay<00:00:20.160> or

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
has this this inside bearing was okay or

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.300 
has this this inside bearing was okay or
the<00:00:21.029> seal<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.810> okay<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> bearing<00:00:23.160> was

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the seal was okay and the bearing was

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.929 
the seal was okay and the bearing was
all<00:00:23.490> right

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
all right

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.450 
all right
so<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.199> figured<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> had<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.160> coming<00:00:26.430> from

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
so I I figured it had to be coming from

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.820 
so I I figured it had to be coming from
this<00:00:26.820> seal<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:29.510> what<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.679> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
this seal here so what as you can see it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.209 
this seal here so what as you can see it
it's<00:00:32.250> pretty<00:00:32.610> hard<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.829> had<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
it's pretty hard to get to so I had to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.650 
it's pretty hard to get to so I had to
be<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.850> creative<00:00:36.620> when<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> came<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.100> with

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
be a little creative when I came up with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.180 
be a little creative when I came up with
was<00:00:39.660> using<00:00:39.989> some<00:00:40.590> red<00:00:40.800> grease<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:42.180> gun<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
was using some red grease and a gun and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
was using some red grease and a gun and
squirting<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.149> packing

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
squirting some down in there and packing

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.310 
squirting some down in there and packing
it<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.379> old<00:00:46.559> credit<00:00:46.980> card<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.990 

and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.699> working<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:55.699> and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.630 

it<00:01:00.000> took<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.660> while<00:01:01.129> but<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:04.400> smooth<00:01:05.400> as

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it took a little while but now smooth as

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.170 
it took a little while but now smooth as
glass<00:01:05.869> no<00:01:06.869> problems<00:01:07.560> whatsoever<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.670> no<00:01:08.700> more

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.109 
squealing so if any of you guys ever
change<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.830> your<00:01:16.830> bearings<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.850> did<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
change your your bearings like I did I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.800 
change your your bearings like I did I
used<00:01:18.290> four<00:01:19.290> G<00:01:19.470> knuckles<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> could<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
used four G knuckles so I could do the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
used four G knuckles so I could do the
five<00:01:21.990> blood<00:01:22.229> conversion<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> little

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
five blood conversion and get a little

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
five blood conversion and get a little
bit<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.580> an<00:01:23.700> T<00:01:23.880> bump<00:01:24.090> steer<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.659> with

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
bit of an T bump steer there with

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.219 
bit of an T bump steer there with
because<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> knuckle<00:01:25.770> designs<00:01:26.130> better<00:01:26.570> I

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.870

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
when you use the four G bearing it has

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.230 
when you use the four G bearing it has
to<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.420> two<00:01:33.630> seals<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.549> if<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.939> your
