somewhere<00:00:42.690> around<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.350> he<00:00:43.440> does<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
somewhere around there and he does a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.110 
somewhere around there and he does a
really<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:44.010> job<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.520> i<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
really good job of it i don't think the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080 
really good job of it i don't think the
opponent's<00:00:45.739> plant<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.950> once<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.730> could<00:00:47.969> be

opponent's plant a once i could be

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.520

mistaken<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.629> i'm<00:00:48.750> pretty<00:00:48.899> sure<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.260> don't

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
way and also if you jump up that way you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
way and also if you jump up that way you
have<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> much<00:01:35.400> better<00:01:35.640> angle

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
have a really you know much better angle

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450 
have a really you know much better angle
on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> bomb<00:01:36.540> site<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.799> example<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> want

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
on the bomb site for example if you want

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
on the bomb site for example if you want
the<00:01:38.610> stairs<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.150> did<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:40.140> bit

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the stairs that he did a little bit

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710 
the stairs that he did a little bit
earlier<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> round<00:01:41.360> he<00:01:42.360> wouldn't<00:01:42.600> have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
earlier in the round he wouldn't have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.179 
earlier in the round he wouldn't have
maybe<00:01:42.869> been<00:01:43.020> able<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> opponent

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
maybe been able to see the opponent

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
maybe been able to see the opponent
planting<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.630> opponent<00:01:46.020> planting<00:01:46.290> would

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
planting or the opponent planting would

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
planting or the opponent planting would
have<00:01:46.500> been<00:01:46.590> able<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.009> him<00:01:47.310> stuff<00:01:48.210> like

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
have been able to see him stuff like

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.850 
have been able to see him stuff like
that<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> way<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> he<00:01:49.380> played<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> was

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that so the way that he played it was

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.859 
that so the way that he played it was
really<00:01:50.189> smart<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:51.149> back<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> board<00:01:51.689> here

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
really smart we're back on board here

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
really smart we're back on board here
with<00:01:51.960> zim<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> again<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.189> mentioned<00:01:53.220> he's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
with zim and again like I mentioned he's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.730 
with zim and again like I mentioned he's
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.390> watching<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> flank<00:01:55.079> over<00:01:55.409> here

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
going to be watching the flank over here

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.560 
going to be watching the flank over here
now<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.640> thing<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.969> not<00:01:57.000> quite<00:01:57.270> sure<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.450> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
now one thing I'm not quite sure if I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
now one thing I'm not quite sure if I
said<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.740> ago<00:01:58.829> um

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
said this because a little bit ago um

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.429 
said this because a little bit ago um
but<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.479> thing<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.719> wish<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.020> he<00:02:01.140> would<00:02:01.320> have

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
but one thing I wish that he would have

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.260 
but one thing I wish that he would have
done<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.009> had<00:02:02.250> bombed<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.790> he<00:02:03.149> was

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
done is not had bombed because he was

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
done is not had bombed because he was
going<00:02:03.509> far<00:02:03.750> away<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.380> bomb<00:02:04.530> said<00:02:04.770> we

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
going far away from the bomb said we

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.889 
going far away from the bomb said we
wanted<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> plan<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
wanted to plan out which is be and I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.240 
wanted to plan out which is be and I
think<00:02:06.930> actually<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.530> round<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.069> over

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
think actually in this round we go over

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.190 
think actually in this round we go over
towards<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.179> essentially<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.020> map

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
towards a but essentially in this map

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230 
towards a but essentially in this map
pretty<00:02:11.099> much<00:02:11.250> every<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.910> want

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
pretty much every time you want

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.540 
pretty much every time you want
try<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.480> rush<00:02:12.630> be<00:02:12.930> unless<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.490> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
try and rush be unless you know you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.220 
try and rush be unless you know you
continue<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.780> doesn't<00:02:16.080> work

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
continue to do that and it doesn't work

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
continue to do that and it doesn't work
but<00:02:16.380> since<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.800> look<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.070> two<00:02:17.280> i<00:02:18.000> would<00:02:18.630> i

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
but since we look for two i would i

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.570 
but since we look for two i would i
would<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.080> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.410> expected<00:02:20.070> us<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.340> be

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
would have kind of expected us to go be

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.280 
would have kind of expected us to go be
but<00:02:20.820> maybe<00:02:20.970> that's<00:02:21.180> why<00:02:21.330> he<00:02:21.510> went<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.810> he<00:02:22.080> gets

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
but maybe that's why he went and he gets

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.980 
but maybe that's why he went and he gets
his<00:02:22.440> plan<00:02:22.680> off<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:23.270> he<00:02:24.270> gets<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.540> plaintiff

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
his plan off here he gets this plaintiff

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.570 
his plan off here he gets this plaintiff
let's<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.380> where<00:02:25.500> he<00:02:25.530> goes<00:02:25.620> he<00:02:25.980> stuns<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
let's see where he goes he stuns the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.890 
let's see where he goes he stuns the
jeep<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:27.150> he<00:02:27.270> knew<00:02:27.420> somebody<00:02:27.750> was<00:02:27.840> there

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
jeep because he knew somebody was there

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.440 
jeep because he knew somebody was there
he<00:02:28.620> almost<00:02:28.650> had<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.250> kill<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:30.000> me<00:02:30.180> try<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
he almost had that kill on me try to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.910 
he almost had that kill on me try to
juke<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.990> opponent<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:31.470> there<00:02:31.710> is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
juke out the opponent right there is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.120 
juke out the opponent right there is
unable<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:33.690> our<00:02:34.200> whole<00:02:34.590> team<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.010> out

unable to do so as our whole team is out
right<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.490> know<00:02:35.670> because<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.480> recorded

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
right now I know because it's recorded

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.970 
right now I know because it's recorded
in<00:02:36.930> theater<00:02:37.230> mode<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> little<00:02:37.740> bit<00:02:37.830> hard

in theater mode it's a little bit hard

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.880 
in theater mode it's a little bit hard

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
I believe the other team was so that's a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.510 
I believe the other team was so that's a
somewhat<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.480> disadvantage<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.110> we<00:03:28.320> had

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
somewhat of a disadvantage that we had

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.430 
somewhat of a disadvantage that we had
but<00:03:29.520> we're<00:03:29.670> not<00:03:29.790> big<00:03:30.000> into<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.720> know<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.050> guess

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.570 
but we're not big into you know I guess
you<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.710> call<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:31.890> cheating<00:03:32.130> although<00:03:32.490> it

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
you can call it cheating although it

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.760 
you can call it cheating although it
lands<00:03:32.970> you're<00:03:33.090> allowed<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:34.590> we

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
lands you're allowed to do it but we

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
round he just joined back but he was own

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.650 
round he just joined back but he was own
eight<00:04:31.680> when<00:04:31.860> he<00:04:31.920> did<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.640> he<00:04:33.090> proceeds<00:04:33.570> to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
eight when he did so and he proceeds to

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.650 
eight when he did so and he proceeds to
go<00:04:33.810> into<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.670> I've<00:04:36.030> never<00:04:36.060> seen<00:04:36.480> it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
go into and it's just I've never seen it

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.360 
go into and it's just I've never seen it
i<00:04:36.780> guess<00:04:36.990> i<00:04:37.200> should<00:04:37.590> probably<00:04:37.860> stop<00:04:38.010> talking

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
i guess i should probably stop talking

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.460 
i guess i should probably stop talking
about<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.550> be<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:39.180> know<00:04:39.300> before<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.870> next<00:04:39.990> snd

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
about it be you know before the next snd

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.230 
about it be you know before the next snd
game<00:04:40.650> would<00:04:40.890> be<00:04:41.010> probably<00:04:41.250> i<00:04:41.460> drop<00:04:41.730> in<00:04:41.910> 0<00:04:42.090> and

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
game would be probably i drop in 0 and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.110 
game would be probably i drop in 0 and
10<00:04:42.360> or<00:04:42.600> even<00:04:42.900> worse<00:04:43.380> i<00:04:43.680> wanna<00:04:43.950> i<00:04:44.310> want<00:04:44.490> 11<00:04:44.940> is

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
10 or even worse i wanna i want 11 is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.870 
10 or even worse i wanna i want 11 is
the<00:04:45.420> worst<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:45.930> do<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:47.280> anyway<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.640> I

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
the worst you can do but anyway so I

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.220 
the worst you can do but anyway so I
mean<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.210> guess<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.480> kind<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.660> feel<00:04:48.780> bad<00:04:48.900> for<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
mean I guess I kind of feel bad for the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.050 
mean I guess I kind of feel bad for the
opponents<00:04:49.680> they<00:04:50.340> were<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.490> good<00:04:50.610> team<00:04:50.850> other

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
opponents they were a good team other

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.390 
opponents they were a good team other
than<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.330> map<00:04:51.690> all<00:04:52.530> four<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.040> them<00:04:53.160> played

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
than this map all four of them played

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.520 
than this map all four of them played
really<00:04:53.610> well<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:55.050> was<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.320> close<00:04:55.500> match

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
really well and this was a close match

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.080 
really well and this was a close match
all<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.040> way<00:04:56.130> through<00:04:56.370> wasn't<00:04:56.730> a<00:04:56.790> screamer

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
all the way through wasn't a screamer

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.300 
all the way through wasn't a screamer
anything<00:04:57.390> like<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:58.260> was<00:04:58.380> either<00:04:58.470> an<00:04:58.800> ICM

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
anything like that it was either an ICM

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.400 
anything like that it was either an ICM
match<00:04:59.520> oh<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.940> was<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.150> gb<00:05:00.780> match<00:05:00.960> or<00:05:01.200> something

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
match oh it was a gb match or something

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.040 
match oh it was a gb match or something
like<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.590> but<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.610> was<00:05:02.840> obviously<00:05:03.840> not<00:05:04.020> a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
like that but it was obviously not a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.480 
like that but it was obviously not a
scrim<00:05:04.350> here<00:05:04.560> because<00:05:04.920> we<00:05:05.250> don't<00:05:05.400> really

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
scrim here because we don't really

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.150 
scrim here because we don't really
scream<00:05:05.820> too<00:05:05.970> much<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.240> SMD<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:06.900> more<00:05:07.170> gun

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
scream too much of SMD it's more gun

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.580 
scream too much of SMD it's more gun
skill<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.780> know<00:05:09.810> communication

able<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:01.170> not<00:06:01.980> pick<00:06:02.280> up<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.580> kill<00:06:02.790> time<00:06:03.540> limit

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
able to not pick up the kill time limit

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.630 
able to not pick up the kill time limit
reached<00:06:04.080> but<00:06:04.410> as<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.770> guys<00:06:04.950> see<00:06:05.160> on<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.400> score

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
reached but as you guys see on the score

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.890 
reached but as you guys see on the score
but<00:06:05.790> he<00:06:05.910> would<00:06:06.030> have<00:06:06.120> had<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.330> pick<00:06:06.480> off<00:06:06.660> to

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
but he would have had to pick off to

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.090 
but he would have had to pick off to
opponent<00:06:07.410> so<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:07.590> didn't<00:06:07.800> really<00:06:07.890> matter

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
opponent so it didn't really matter

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.070 
opponent so it didn't really matter
whether<00:06:08.790> or<00:06:08.940> not<00:06:09.030> he<00:06:09.180> got<00:06:09.270> that<00:06:09.450> kill<00:06:09.720> at<00:06:09.930> all

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
whether or not he got that kill at all

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.560 
whether or not he got that kill at all
unless<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:11.130> game<00:06:11.310> went<00:06:11.700> into<00:06:11.760> overtime<00:06:12.000> which

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
unless the game went into overtime which

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.020 
unless the game went into overtime which
let's<00:06:13.080> see<00:06:13.200> if<00:06:13.290> it<00:06:13.410> does<00:06:13.590> so<00:06:14.220> then<00:06:14.580> right<00:06:14.730> here

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
let's see if it does so then right here

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.030 
let's see if it does so then right here
I<00:06:15.180> think<00:06:15.570> his<00:06:15.930> mentality<00:06:16.140> going<00:06:16.650> into<00:06:16.920> this

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
I think his mentality going into this

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.610 
I think his mentality going into this
last<00:06:17.130> round<00:06:17.490> is<00:06:17.850> let's<00:06:18.720> finish<00:06:18.900> this<00:06:19.080> game<00:06:19.290> I
