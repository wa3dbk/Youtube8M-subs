 Hello everyone, my name is Jason and I am from Corsair. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Today, I will demonstrate how 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Make wave effects on the new RGB mechanical keyboard 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 I have already installed this software. Currently in the "Lighting" tab 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Now I have deleted all my preset groups here. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Because these preset groups are used to make other or different effects. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 So the operation will be very simple, all you have to do is highlight it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 To set all the buttons for a wave effect, right click, then you want to create a new group 9 00:00:26,000 --&gt; 00:00:28,000 I will name this group "Wave 1". 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 The reason for naming is because all of these settings are stored. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 So you can use it later, or share these settings with your friends. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 After saving "Wave 1", this is where I want to install the wave effect. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Right click and select "Assign New Lighting" 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Now you will see four groups, but this time I will make a "wave effect" 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I will name this group again because it will be stored in the "lighting" database located right here. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 So, after creating a name, right click to add lighting effects to the wave. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 At this point, by default, after adding the lighting effect, I will click "OK". 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Now, when I tap a button on the keyboard, a single wave effect is formed, which is formed only once from left to right on the keyboard. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Now, if I go back and select "Edit Lighting", you will see a lot 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Settings, here you can choose "Start Wave Effect", which will form a wave effect continuously. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 After a certain number of times, you can select "End", you can choose to use "press button" or "release button" to do this 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 One of the more popular things people will do is to "start" 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 I choose "OK" and the lighting will start automatically on the keyboard. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Now, it takes a little while to make the wave effect again, because I need to set my speed and duration settings. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So I will go back and edit the lighting, I will increase the speed and reduce the duration, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 In order to get a smoother wave mode on the keyboard. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Now you will see the speed is quite fast. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 In order to get a smoother wave mode on the keyboard. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 You can use this dial to actually dial in the direction of the wave effect you want to make. . 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I hope that you can try it out and find what settings look cool or that are most useful to you. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Now, in addition to making a single color wave effect, you have the flexibility to add any color to the wave effect. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Many people will make rainbow wave effects on their keyboards here. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 In this demo, I just chose several colors for the wave effect, just to let you know what the multicolor wave effect looks like. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Very simple, very fast, you can set the wave mode on the keyboard 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Thank you for watching this tutorial, and we'll be releasing more tutorials on some of the more advanced lighting features that can be achieved with wave effects. Thank you
