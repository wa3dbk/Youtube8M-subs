00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979 
still always use a booster so what do

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.890 
still always use a booster so what do
you<00:00:08.130> sir<00:00:08.189> are<00:00:08.460> check<00:00:08.760> about<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.240> ladies

you sir are check about that ladies
registration<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.590> tuba<00:00:11.009> because<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.880> is

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
registration in the tuba because it is

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.480 
registration in the tuba because it is
something<00:00:12.120> inside<00:00:12.839> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> pipe<00:00:13.620> that's<00:00:14.190> turn

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
something inside of the pipe that's turn

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.210 
something inside of the pipe that's turn
why<00:00:15.120> creates<00:00:15.780> restriction<00:00:16.320> yes<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.100> they

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
why creates restriction yes so they

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220 
why creates restriction yes so they
always<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.610> free<00:00:17.910> el<00:00:18.090> protocolo<00:00:18.540> like<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
always are free el protocolo like this

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.920 
always are free el protocolo like this
yeah<00:00:19.560> yeah<00:00:19.950> you<00:00:20.370> know<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.730> agree<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.120> you<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
yeah yeah you know I agree with you you

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.420 
yeah yeah you know I agree with you you
know<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.350> i<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.620> a<00:00:22.650> check<00:00:22.890> valve<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.310> their

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
know so i have a check valve in their

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.950 
know so i have a check valve in their
crate<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:23.880> anything<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.360> inside<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
crate because anything that's inside of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.900 
crate because anything that's inside of
a<00:00:25.020> chamber<00:00:25.590> even<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.280> vacuum<00:00:26.430> cleaner<00:00:26.760> hose

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
a chamber even in a vacuum cleaner hose

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
a chamber even in a vacuum cleaner hose
if<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.330> dirt<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.690> the<00:00:27.780> walls<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.380> slows

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
if you got dirt on the walls it slows

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200 
if you got dirt on the walls it slows
down<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.860> vacuum<00:00:29.340> mm-hmm<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.970> every

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
down your vacuum mm-hmm so every

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
down your vacuum mm-hmm so every
restriction<00:00:30.750> her<00:00:30.870> chair<00:00:31.140> yes<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.770> something

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
restriction her chair yes I'm something

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
restriction her chair yes I'm something
is<00:00:32.700> easy<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.500> say<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.859> you<00:00:34.949> can

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
is easy to have they say that you can

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.729 
is easy to have they say that you can
rinse<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.699> you<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.179> removing<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.750> okay

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
rinse it out you know removing this okay

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.049 
rinse it out you know removing this okay
the<00:00:38.309> machine<00:00:38.749> um<00:00:39.749> I<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:41.339> that<00:00:41.789> you<00:00:41.879> can

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the machine um I think that you can

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
the machine um I think that you can
attach<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.749> any<00:00:43.050> other<00:00:43.289> recovery<00:00:43.679> time

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
attach this to any other recovery time

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.549 
attach this to any other recovery time
whatever<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.019> need<00:00:46.409> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
whatever I don't know but you need to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.439 
whatever I don't know but you need to
use<00:00:46.739> how<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.219> should<00:00:47.339> I<00:00:47.760> would<00:00:47.940> remove<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
use how I should I would remove it to

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.000 
use how I should I would remove it to
clean<00:00:48.749> up<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.409> a<00:00:49.440> painting<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
clean up I think there is a painting a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.739 
clean up I think there is a painting a
total<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:50.730> forgot<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.059> say<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
total i forgot to say over here when we

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:53.419 
total i forgot to say over here when we
were<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> bottom<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> machine<00:00:52.710> there

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
were in the bottom of the machine there

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.180 
were in the bottom of the machine there
is<00:00:53.519> no<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.940> pressure<00:00:54.179> gauge<00:00:54.449> Oh<00:00:54.949> your<00:00:55.949> pressure

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is no a pressure gauge Oh your pressure

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.779 
is no a pressure gauge Oh your pressure
gates<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> nothing<00:00:57.019> so<00:00:58.489> how<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> know

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
gates and nothing so how do you know

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.669 
gates and nothing so how do you know
whatever<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.539> need<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.960> yeah<00:01:01.319> you<00:01:01.379> don't

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
whatever you need to get yeah you don't

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.340 
whatever you need to get yeah you don't
maybe<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.429> have<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.030> still<00:01:03.269> why<00:01:04.080> not

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
maybe you can have it by still why not

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
maybe you can have it by still why not
how<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:04.890> machine<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> spend<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
how is the machine if you spend that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
how is the machine if you spend that
kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> money<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.780> machine<00:01:07.020> bus<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
kind of money for the machine bus the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.610 
kind of money for the machine bus the
pressure<00:01:09.180> gauge<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
pressure gauge you can get I can get it

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.680 
pressure gauge you can get I can get it
for<00:01:10.860> less<00:01:11.430> than<00:01:11.610> twenty<00:01:11.910> bucks<00:01:12.030> I'm

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
for less than twenty bucks I'm

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.270 
for less than twenty bucks I'm
personally<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.860> less<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.160> that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
personally can get it for less than that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
personally can get it for less than that
yeah<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.300> it's<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.900> bad<00:01:16.110> good<00:01:16.440> point

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
yeah so it's not that bad good point

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.340 
yeah so it's not that bad good point
well<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.940> a<00:01:18.240> thursday<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
well what is that a thursday the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
well what is that a thursday the
regulator<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.060> regular<00:01:21.060> should<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
regulator a regular should be in the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
regulator a regular should be in the
front<00:01:21.510> yeah<00:01:22.020> i<00:01:22.050> think<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.860> should<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.010> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
front yeah i think that should be the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
front yeah i think that should be the
form<00:01:23.370> because<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.730> already<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.240> everything

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
form because you already put everything

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.800 
form because you already put everything
wrong<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.140> why<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.550> side<00:01:26.780> okay<00:01:27.780> i

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
wrong way why this on the side okay i

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.710 
wrong way why this on the side okay i
know<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.800> he<00:01:28.890> did<00:01:29.010> it<00:01:29.160> because<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.720> will

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
know what he did it because they will

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.540 
know what he did it because they will
see<00:01:31.050> when<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.200> open<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.620> machine<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
see when we open the machine the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.450 
see when we open the machine the
regulator<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.690> know<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.260> like<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
regulator you know it's like this you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
regulator you know it's like this you
know<00:01:35.810> elbow<00:01:36.810> inside<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.950> uh<00:01:38.600> okay<00:01:39.600> i<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.110> let

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
know elbow inside so uh okay i can let

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.560 
know elbow inside so uh okay i can let
pass<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.800> because<00:01:41.160> it's<00:01:41.430> hard<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.450> do

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
pass that because it's hard to to do

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
pass that because it's hard to to do
something<00:01:42.870> like<00:01:42.900> that<00:01:43.020> okay<00:01:43.980> bye<00:01:44.160> still<00:01:44.370> okay

probably you know what it will be
probably<00:02:34.920> better<00:02:35.220> maybe<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.420> same<00:02:36.630> thing<00:02:36.870> as

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
probably better maybe the same thing as

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
the bottom flame screws yeah so it would

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.910 
the bottom flame screws yeah so it would
be<00:02:39.720> easier<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.590> want<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> do

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
matter because sometimes you don't want

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.980 
matter because sometimes you don't want
to<00:02:47.250> hug<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.940> need<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.450> trout<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
to hug you need to go to the trout to

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.530 
to hug you need to go to the trout to
get<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.560> whatever<00:02:50.040> happens<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.390> know<00:02:51.480> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
get you do whatever happens you know you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.010 
get you do whatever happens you know you
can<00:02:51.750> make<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.960> easier<00:02:52.320> sure<00:02:52.890> oh<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.520> way

should be like a son who they are this

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.130 
should be like a son who they are this
is<00:03:11.640> one<00:03:11.760> quarter<00:03:12.530> what<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.740> quarter<00:03:14.040> sir

went to throw this to reduce the amps
you<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> since<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.440> three

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
you know so so since I on the three

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.800 
you know so so since I on the three
motor<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.190> that's<00:03:29.430> why<00:03:29.610> because<00:03:30.120> he<00:03:30.510> wants<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
motor so that's why because he wants to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.800 
motor so that's why because he wants to
reduce<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.200> amps<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.520> know<00:03:32.640> something
