00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
there's a mask if they're here I don't

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.910 
there's a mask if they're here I don't
want<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.750> battle<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.140> guy<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.590> guy<00:02:55.769> he

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
want to battle that guy and this guy he

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.100 
want to battle that guy and this guy he
gives<00:02:56.099> me<00:02:56.220> pay<00:02:56.400> back<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.830> Tim<00:02:58.830> 66<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.610> payback

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
gives me pay back and Tim 66 is payback

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.720 
gives me pay back and Tim 66 is payback
so<00:03:01.110> yeah<00:03:01.319> i<00:03:01.349> don't<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.860> i'll<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.010> using<00:03:02.459> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
so yeah i don't think i'll be using that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.430 
so yeah i don't think i'll be using that
much<00:03:03.000> because<00:03:03.150> i<00:03:03.510> don't<00:03:03.810> want<00:03:03.840> live<00:03:04.080> wire<00:03:04.319> to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
much because i don't want live wire to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.309 
much because i don't want live wire to
take<00:03:04.620> hits<00:03:05.420> anyways<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.750> i<00:03:06.930> don't<00:03:07.079> think<00:03:07.140> he

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
take hits anyways and i don't think he

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.220 
take hits anyways and i don't think he
can<00:03:07.470> learn<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:09.060> guy<00:03:09.450> has<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:09.720> three

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
can learn it so this guy has like three

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.870 
can learn it so this guy has like three
machop's<00:03:10.680> or<00:03:10.920> something
