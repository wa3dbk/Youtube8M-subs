00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.530

 times in the week 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.140
 because I was watching the comments and 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.440

 rarefied let's get ad link to 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.409
 make the surprise chest just from a taleb chest 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:15.909
 a mere you want to multiply more 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.909
 midwife the wood is 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.220
 it's part of america 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:38.920

 Is it good already? It 's good. Let's go there. 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:55.170
 here make or descend here and silver 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.579
 it was not I do not know if it serves with 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.640
 normal materials only with the miner I 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:10.780
 I think it 's just with ores 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:14.109
 doing our zito chest ready 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.989
 our attack and in the last video I did not 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:25.420
 I know for you how I did for Oman. 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:33.579
 athens and I'm going to use this now to 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.299
 I only saw that I know there I 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.709
 your cell phone 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:41.260
 there it was not yet going to have to look for 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:44.310
 ore we are chipped tidy up 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.310
 I know it will be quickly 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.030
 so come on you will need 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.639
 do here 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.250
 and they will start there 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:22.900
 I hope people find a good fast 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.810
 is even low because when man 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:36.640
 is the team was bad to show to 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:38.350
 you how good I tried over and 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.320
 if he's going to stay a little bit not guys 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.870
 because you know how stupid it is 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.000
 great 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.840
 I'll get one more. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.910
 miner 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:01.330
 It's just that you have to change that button on and now. 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.330
 Another bug came in from my cell phone that is 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.650
 when I start and do not stop there 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.760
 chests and boards only then when 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.500
 We find a miner. 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.910
 We'll have to warm up and if it is 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.410
 Iron I do not know but I do not know but he goes 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.860
 have to do this he'll have to 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.730
 start one entered the river 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.730
 It's not too scary. 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:39.430
 Not even tomorrow. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.889
 there I would look at a little piece of bread that is what 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.639
 It's going to be very bad, I thought. 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.259
 chef stopped or chop cut 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.120
 cut 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:53.590
 know that I'm going to give a cut attack 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.520
 fast and when you have to play with mine 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:05.080
 I already have minerals for you. 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:07.389
 I went well and came back here and played the 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.069
 Iron here that I found 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.130
 Then you will do this to multiply 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:17.710
 you will see that I'm six right 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:25.289
 so opened the chest put the 6 close the 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:38.289
 opened again took six to twelve of the 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:42.039
 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 and 12 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:44.409
 You press on the one that closes 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.279
 without taking the application out of the 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.659
 use the team will stay in referenced and 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:53.550
 applications 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:57.849
 here at day care foot and miss it stop 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.819
 beauty and come again in it may 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:14.969
 open without doing anything even can be done 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:17.830
 our beautiful is with 60 new neighborhood 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:21.580
 Our face has six more. 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:27.819
 Then you get 12 66 is equal to twelve 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:32.229
 well thanks for where I am 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:36.580
 teacher knows that one plus one is 233 66 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:40.310
 12 can do so can vote this 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:42.800
 elderly and take with up to 12 to 24 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.060
 but then put another one of four with up 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.490
 two shots 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.810
 do not go here so here's with all 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.650
 ores galley 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:55.190
 so this is what I was bringing here 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:59.480
 For you and if how to multiply miners 

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.230
 and multiply 6 took 12 for you. 

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.060
 that 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.010
 If you liked this video, the 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.020
 help came to something that did not 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.840
 I liked the schooling level in 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.830
 and this is what my mother and 

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.830
