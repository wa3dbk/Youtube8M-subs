00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200 

which<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.960> you<00:00:01.290> select<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.770> edge<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.970> quad

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
which is you select the edge of a quad

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.869 
which is you select the edge of a quad
and<00:00:03.890> then<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.009> allows<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> click<00:00:05.670> two

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
and then it allows you to click two

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.780 
and then it allows you to click two
points<00:00:06.240> from<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.839> create<00:00:07.109> another<00:00:07.350> quad<00:00:07.790> so

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
points from it to create another quad so

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.330 
points from it to create another quad so
if<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.120> look<00:00:09.269> right<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:10.010> you<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.190> see

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
if you look right now you can see

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.530 
if you look right now you can see
there's<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.610> few<00:00:11.880> points<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.330> are<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> bit

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
there's a few points that are a bit

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.390 
there's a few points that are a bit
messy<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:13.440> doing<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.980> using<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
messy so what I'm doing is using the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.129 
messy so what I'm doing is using the
brush<00:00:14.580> tool<00:00:14.880> just<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> smooth<00:00:15.570> them<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.900> once

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
brush tool just to smooth them out once

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
brush tool just to smooth them out once
again<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.520> flow<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:18.029> on

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
again so I can get that flow going on

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.650 
again so I can get that flow going on
the<00:00:18.779> chin<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.400> work<00:00:20.400> my<00:00:20.580> way<00:00:20.609> down<00:00:20.760> as<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.510> will

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the chin and work my way down as I will

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.160 
the chin and work my way down as I will
perform<00:00:26.359> alright<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.080> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
perform alright so I'm just going to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
perform alright so I'm just going to
skip<00:00:28.439> forward<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.890> little<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.789> see

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
skip forward a little bit so you can see

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.790 
skip forward a little bit so you can see
will<00:00:30.359> look<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.109> fully<00:00:31.320> done

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.149 

okay<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:39.859> here<00:00:40.579> we<00:00:40.760> are<00:00:40.999> and<00:00:41.600> we've<00:00:41.989> got<00:00:42.409> a<00:00:42.649> bit

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
okay so here we are and we've got a bit

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.669 
okay so here we are and we've got a bit
of<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.309> problem<00:00:43.339> here<00:00:43.699> we<00:00:44.690> have<00:00:44.839> a<00:00:44.870> few<00:00:45.140> vertices

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
of a problem here we have a few vertices

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.139 
of a problem here we have a few vertices
that<00:00:45.710> can't<00:00:46.070> connect<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.309> anything<00:00:46.789> right<00:00:47.120> now

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
that can't connect to anything right now

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.240 
that can't connect to anything right now
so<00:00:47.839> I'm<00:00:47.899> going<00:00:48.049> to<00:00:48.140> use<00:00:48.289> my<00:00:48.320> split<00:00:48.799> ring<00:00:48.979> tool

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
so I'm going to use my split ring tool

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.049 
so I'm going to use my split ring tool
and<00:00:49.460> add<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.629> few<00:00:51.049> more<00:00:51.309> fuzzy<00:00:52.309> lines<00:00:52.549> for<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
and add a few more fuzzy lines for the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.170 
and add a few more fuzzy lines for the
neck<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:54.049> connect<00:00:54.799> up<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:54.979> this<00:00:55.850> will<00:00:56.030> also

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
neck to connect up to this will also

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.910 
neck to connect up to this will also
help<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.570> bottom<00:00:56.869> of<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.019> neck<00:00:57.199> because<00:00:57.680> once

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
help the bottom of the neck because once

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.490 
help the bottom of the neck because once
i<00:00:58.039> get<00:00:58.219> like<00:00:58.369> i<00:00:58.519> said<00:00:58.760> before<00:00:59.260> the<00:01:00.260> more

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
i get like i said before the more

i get like i said before the more
compact<00:01:01.100> or<00:01:01.250> four<00:01:01.430> essays<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:02.119> faces<00:01:02.809> the

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
compact or four essays and faces the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.169 
compact or four essays and faces the
better<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.220> information<00:01:04.759> is<00:01:04.820> going<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.059> be

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
better that information is going to be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:06.550 
better that information is going to be
there<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.869> bottom<00:01:06.080> of<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.200> neck<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.530> a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
there so the bottom of the neck is a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.080 
there so the bottom of the neck is a
really<00:01:06.950> really<00:01:07.130> good<00:01:07.280> place<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.700> have<00:01:07.820> those

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
really really good place to have those

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.219 
really really good place to have those
at<00:01:08.689> least<00:01:08.750> for<00:01:09.289> this<00:01:09.409> model<00:01:09.649> shall<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.130> say<00:01:14.229> so

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
at least for this model shall I say so

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.469 
at least for this model shall I say so
here<00:01:15.950> we<00:01:16.100> are<00:01:16.280> we've<00:01:16.459> got<00:01:16.580> our<00:01:16.729> neck<00:01:16.970> fully

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
here we are we've got our neck fully

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.370 
here we are we've got our neck fully
done<00:01:17.659> for<00:01:17.929> now<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.880> may<00:01:20.450> those<00:01:20.630> lines<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.200> bit

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
done for now but may those lines a bit

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.350 
done for now but may those lines a bit
better<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.100> moment<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.729> we're<00:01:23.209> going<00:01:23.330> to

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
better for the moment and we're going to

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.180 
better for the moment and we're going to
start<00:01:23.600> working<00:01:23.780> on<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> nose<00:01:24.319> once<00:01:25.009> again

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
start working on the nose once again

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.160 
start working on the nose once again
we're<00:01:25.610> going<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.850> use<00:01:26.000> our<00:01:26.179> point<00:01:26.569> faces<00:01:26.959> tool

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
we're going to use our point faces tool

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.499 
we're going to use our point faces tool
to<00:01:27.289> start<00:01:27.560> off<00:01:27.679> with<00:01:27.950> just<00:01:28.819> to<00:01:28.970> get<00:01:29.270> some

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
to start off with just to get some

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.289 
to start off with just to get some
starting<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.319> pology<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.009> nose<00:01:31.299> following

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
starting to pology on the nose following

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.260 
starting to pology on the nose following
these<00:01:32.420> contours<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.350> face<00:01:34.149> we're<00:01:35.149> going

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
these contours of the face we're going

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:48.420 
these contours of the face we're going
to<00:01:35.390> make<00:01:35.750> our<00:01:35.990> points<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:36.890> carry<00:01:37.250> on

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.350 

if<00:01:49.230> you<00:01:50.230> look<00:01:50.380> as<00:01:50.560> I'm<00:01:50.710> doing<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:52.240> I'm

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
if you look as I'm doing this what I'm

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.180 
if you look as I'm doing this what I'm
trying<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.750> do<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.350> just<00:01:53.560> trying<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.950> follow

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
trying to do is just trying to follow

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.430 
trying to do is just trying to follow
the<00:01:54.460> points<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.330> lip<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:55.960> when<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.260> comes

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the points of the lip so when it comes

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.520 
the points of the lip so when it comes
to<00:01:56.650> joining<00:01:56.890> up<00:01:57.100> two<00:01:57.490> phases<00:01:58.410> for<00:01:59.410> the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
to joining up two phases for the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.670 
to joining up two phases for the
topology<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.220> actual<00:02:00.670> object<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.380> won't

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
topology of the actual object it won't

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.410 
topology of the actual object it won't
be<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.860> hard<00:02:03.130> rubber<00:02:03.310> tool<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:04.090> means<00:02:04.330> that

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
be a hard rubber tool it means that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.210 
be a hard rubber tool it means that
we'll<00:02:04.600> all<00:02:04.780> be<00:02:04.990> relative<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.560> each<00:02:05.590> other<00:02:05.860> and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
we'll all be relative to each other and

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:15.930 
we'll all be relative to each other and
make<00:02:06.729> my<00:02:06.880> life<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.240> hell<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.630> lot<00:02:07.780> easier<00:02:14.940> so

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
make my life a hell of a lot easier so

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.190 
make my life a hell of a lot easier so
once<00:02:16.180> again<00:02:16.360> I'm<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:16.750> going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.959> skip

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
once again I'm just going to skip

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.080 
once again I'm just going to skip
forward<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.650> little<00:02:17.770> bit<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.820> part

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
forward a little bit just so this part

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.280 
forward a little bit just so this part
of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.209> nose<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.570> done<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:22.810> right<00:02:23.020> now<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
of the nose is done all right now the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.290 
of the nose is done all right now the
nose<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.860> pretty<00:02:24.340> much<00:02:24.489> done<00:02:24.880> we're<00:02:25.090> going<00:02:25.239> to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
nose is pretty much done we're going to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.810 
nose is pretty much done we're going to
do<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.540> center<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.230> nose<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.709> work<00:02:27.640> our

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
do the center of the nose and work our

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.970 
do the center of the nose and work our
way<00:02:27.850> up<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.690> bridge<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.680> middle<00:02:29.950> of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
way up to that bridge in the middle of

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.550 
way up to that bridge in the middle of
the<00:02:30.100> head<00:02:30.370> as<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:32.020> we<00:02:32.170> were<00:02:32.290> making

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
the head as you can see we were making

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.350 
the head as you can see we were making
it<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.739> little<00:02:32.950> bit<00:02:33.130> thin<00:02:33.370> as<00:02:33.520> we<00:02:33.730> go<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.150> top

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
it a little bit thin as we go to the top

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.110 
it a little bit thin as we go to the top
because<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:35.230> want<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.800> keep<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.850> shape

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
because we want it to keep in the shape

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.810 
because we want it to keep in the shape
of<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.360> face<00:02:37.600> as<00:02:38.530> well<00:02:38.950> as<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.280> lines<00:02:39.520> to

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
of the face as well as the lines to

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.479 
of the face as well as the lines to
follow<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.330> crease<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.989> top<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.380> head

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.250 

all<00:02:45.489> right<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:45.970> let's<00:02:46.300> work<00:02:46.600> our<00:02:46.810> way<00:02:46.840> going

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
all right so let's work our way going

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.900 
all right so let's work our way going
along<00:02:47.380> connecting<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:49.230> top<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.440> mouth

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
along connecting up the top of the mouth

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:59.350 
along connecting up the top of the mouth
to<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:51.940> bottom<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> nose

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.089 

and<00:03:00.360> once<00:03:00.750> again<00:03:00.959> I'm<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.530> skip<00:03:01.739> forward

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
and once again I'm going to skip forward

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.250 
and once again I'm going to skip forward
a<00:03:02.220> little<00:03:02.370> bit<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.599> we're<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.049> waiting

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
a little bit just so we're not waiting

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.420 
a little bit just so we're not waiting
around<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:06.319> here<00:03:07.319> we<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.069> we're<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.340> to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
around and here we are so we're going to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.289 
around and here we are so we're going to
attach<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.450> eyes<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.989> mouth<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:11.180> once<00:03:12.180> again

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
attach the eyes and mouth and once again

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.660 
attach the eyes and mouth and once again
we<00:03:12.569> will<00:03:12.629> try<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.230> follow<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.920> edge<00:03:14.099> flow<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
we will try and follow the edge flow of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.289 
we will try and follow the edge flow of
the<00:03:15.060> ayah<00:03:15.239> keep<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:16.019> round<00:03:17.299> because

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
the ayah keep it going round because

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.690 
the ayah keep it going round because
once<00:03:18.480> again<00:03:18.659> when<00:03:19.110> we<00:03:19.290> becomes<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.950> main<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
once again when we becomes the main and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.690 
once again when we becomes the main and
we<00:03:20.819> want<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.420> format<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.989> any<00:03:22.140> way

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
we want it to the format in any way

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.920 
we want it to the format in any way
these<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.940> parts<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.299> are<00:03:24.450> going<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.659> be

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
these are the parts that are going to be

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.619 
these are the parts that are going to be
stretching<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.459> changing<00:03:26.909> shape<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.540> you

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
stretching and changing shape so you

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.059 
stretching and changing shape so you
want<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.870> keep<00:03:28.049> them<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:30.000> reasonable<00:03:30.540> size

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
want to keep them to a reasonable size

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.860 
want to keep them to a reasonable size
but<00:03:32.069> keep<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.579> edge<00:03:32.730> flow<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.599> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
but keep the edge flow going so it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.350 
but keep the edge flow going so it
always<00:03:34.109> look<00:03:34.470> good

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
always look good

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.860 
always look good
so<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.660> skip<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.930> little<00:03:38.260> bit<00:03:38.380> now

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so I'm going to skip a little bit now

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.330 
so I'm going to skip a little bit now
okay<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:40.930> I've<00:03:41.260> worked<00:03:41.530> my<00:03:41.650> way<00:03:41.770> up<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.160> hill<00:03:42.310> a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
okay so I've worked my way up the hill a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.640 
okay so I've worked my way up the hill a
bit<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.819> connected<00:03:43.660> all<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.900> major<00:03:44.110> parts<00:03:44.500> of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
bit and connected all the major parts of

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.210 
bit and connected all the major parts of
the<00:03:44.739> face<00:03:45.060> while<00:03:46.060> i'm<00:03:46.180> doing<00:03:46.360> here<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:47.220> trying

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the face while i'm doing here is trying

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.280 
the face while i'm doing here is trying
to<00:03:48.489> sort<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.270> put<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.690> topology<00:03:50.260> a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
to sort out the put the topology a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.190 
to sort out the put the topology a
little<00:03:50.590> bit<00:03:50.770> as<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.790> can<00:03:51.940> see<00:03:52.150> sometimes<00:03:52.840> you

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
little bit as you can see sometimes you

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.850 
little bit as you can see sometimes you
get<00:03:53.410> five<00:03:53.980> sided<00:03:54.280> or<00:03:54.730> chasse<00:03:55.660> points<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:56.770> are

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
get five sided or chasse points that are

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.120 
get five sided or chasse points that are
five<00:03:57.069> edges<00:03:57.510> when<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.660> find<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.980> want

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
five edges when you find this you want

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.890 
five edges when you find this you want
to<00:04:00.220> try<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.520> sort<00:04:00.760> them<00:04:00.819> out<00:04:00.970> if<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.180> can<00:04:01.510> but

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
to try and sort them out if you can but

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.449 
to try and sort them out if you can but
they're<00:04:02.050> not<00:04:02.230> such<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> big<00:04:02.890> yawn<00:04:03.160> certain

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
they're not such a big yawn certain

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.240 
they're not such a big yawn certain
areas<00:04:04.410> when<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.530> get<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.709> six<00:04:05.950> sided<00:04:06.069> shape

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
areas when you get a six sided shape

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.070 
areas when you get a six sided shape
that's<00:04:06.700> when<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:06.970> get<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> problem<00:04:07.569> but<00:04:07.930> when

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
that's when you get a problem but when

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.740 
that's when you get a problem but when
you<00:04:08.110> have<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.350> five<00:04:08.769> edged<00:04:09.250> shape<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.300> not<00:04:10.510> too

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
you have a five edged shape is not too

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.660 
you have a five edged shape is not too
bad<00:04:10.959> this<00:04:11.170> just<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.980> know<00:04:12.130> try<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.370> keep<00:04:12.519> them

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
bad this just you know try to keep them

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.390 
bad this just you know try to keep them
out<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.000> places<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:13.510> are<00:04:13.870> going<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:14.110> be

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
out the places that are going to be

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.690 
out the places that are going to be
changing<00:04:15.400> too<00:04:15.880> much<00:04:16.120> when<00:04:16.419> you're<00:04:16.540> animating

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
changing too much when you're animating

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.009 
changing too much when you're animating
so<00:04:18.700> I'm<00:04:18.790> just<00:04:18.970> trying<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.180> work<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.570> out<00:04:19.690> it

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
so I'm just trying to work it out it

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.830 
so I'm just trying to work it out it
could<00:04:20.290> be<00:04:20.440> here<00:04:20.650> just<00:04:21.430> add<00:04:21.669> extra<00:04:22.389> edge<00:04:22.510> loop

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
could be here just add extra edge loop

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.440 
could be here just add extra edge loop
and<00:04:23.310> then<00:04:24.310> we're<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:24.520> going<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.820> work<00:04:25.000> over

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
and then we're just going to work over

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.409 
and then we're just going to work over
again<00:04:25.810> with<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.530> brush<00:04:26.770> tool<00:04:27.040> just<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.430> get

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
again with the brush tool just to get

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.219 
again with the brush tool just to get
everything<00:04:28.570> looking<00:04:29.229> quite<00:04:30.130> smooth<00:04:30.550> as<00:04:31.229> well

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
everything looking quite smooth as well

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:43.519 
everything looking quite smooth as well
as<00:04:32.380> keeping<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.830> edge<00:04:33.010> flow<00:04:33.250> once<00:04:33.460> again

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
alright so I'm going to start working up

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.110 
alright so I'm going to start working up
the<00:05:01.660> head<00:05:01.810> now<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.290> didn't<00:05:03.220> apology<00:05:03.669> as<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:03.910> go

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
the head now I didn't apology as I go

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.060 
the head now I didn't apology as I go
along<00:05:04.240> once<00:05:04.720> again<00:05:04.870> following<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.620> crevice

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
along once again following the crevice

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.390 
along once again following the crevice
in<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.250> top<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.669> head<00:05:07.889> I'm<00:05:08.889> getting<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.220> bit

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
in the top of the head I'm getting a bit

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.540 
in the top of the head I'm getting a bit
rough<00:05:09.669> here<00:05:10.060> but<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:10.840> can<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.530> use<00:05:11.710> my<00:05:11.979> movers

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
rough here but I can just use my movers

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.510 
rough here but I can just use my movers
his<00:05:12.850> tool<00:05:13.090> once<00:05:14.050> again<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.740> just<00:05:14.949> move<00:05:15.160> them<00:05:15.340> to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
his tool once again to just move them to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.219 
his tool once again to just move them to
the<00:05:15.610> center<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:16.000> they'll<00:05:16.300> snap<00:05:16.570> together<00:05:16.750> and

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
the center and they'll snap together and

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.770 
the center and they'll snap together and
use<00:05:18.130> my<00:05:18.310> brush<00:05:18.490> tool<00:05:18.520> just<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.210> evening<00:05:19.540> mark

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
use my brush tool just the evening mark

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.800 
use my brush tool just the evening mark
so<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.080> get<00:05:20.320> that<00:05:20.440> right<00:05:20.500> flow<00:05:21.070> going<00:05:21.810> without

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
so I get that right flow going without

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.260 
so I get that right flow going without
any<00:05:23.400> points<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.520> look<00:05:24.729> like<00:05:24.850> they<00:05:25.030> shouldn't

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
any points that look like they shouldn't

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.650 
any points that look like they shouldn't
be<00:05:25.389> there

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.700 

okay<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:31.720> I'm<00:05:32.080> going<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.290> start<00:05:32.380> working

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
okay so I'm going to start working

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.740 
okay so I'm going to start working
around<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.100> ear<00:05:33.340> now<00:05:33.580> or<00:05:33.850> should<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.419> say<00:05:34.450> the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
around the ear now or should I say the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.890 
around the ear now or should I say the
earhole<00:05:35.880> just<00:05:36.880> so<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.150> could<00:05:37.240> have<00:05:37.450> a<00:05:37.510> point<00:05:37.810> of

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
earhole just so I could have a point of

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.960 
earhole just so I could have a point of
reference<00:05:37.960> when<00:05:38.740> I<00:05:38.889> can<00:05:39.070> join<00:05:39.310> up<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.550> draw

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
reference when I can join up the draw

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
reference when I can join up the draw
and<00:05:40.030> whatnot<00:05:40.419> so<00:05:40.450> I'm<00:05:41.080> not<00:05:41.260> going<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:41.800> randomly

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
and whatnot so I'm not going to randomly

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.080 
and whatnot so I'm not going to randomly
I'm<00:05:43.990> going<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.100> speed<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.400> up<00:05:45.580> just<00:05:45.790> a<00:05:45.910> little

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
I'm going to speed it up just a little

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.570 
I'm going to speed it up just a little
bit<00:05:46.180> it's<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.720> same<00:05:46.930> process<00:05:47.440> as<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.770> neck

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
bit it's the same process as the neck

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.760 
bit it's the same process as the neck
and<00:05:48.940> everything<00:05:49.450> else<00:05:49.930> we're<00:05:50.200> wasting<00:05:50.680> the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
and everything else we're wasting the

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.860 
and everything else we're wasting the
work<00:05:50.919> my<00:05:51.070> way<00:05:51.220> around<00:05:51.340> while<00:05:52.180> filling<00:05:52.720> into

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
work my way around while filling into

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.070 
work my way around while filling into
the<00:05:53.139> apology<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:54.300> working<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.540> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
the apology and working to the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.100 
the apology and working to the
deformations<00:05:56.740> of<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.010> actual<00:05:57.280> object<00:05:57.700> so

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
deformations of the actual object so

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.750 
deformations of the actual object so
making<00:05:59.110> sure<00:05:59.260> that<00:05:59.740> the<00:06:00.010> polygons<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:00.669> I

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
making sure that the polygons that I

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.230 
making sure that the polygons that I
create<00:06:01.090> aren't<00:06:01.419> too<00:06:01.570> big<00:06:01.810> for<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.710> face<00:06:03.240> but

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
create aren't too big for the face but

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.270 
create aren't too big for the face but
aren't<00:06:04.630> too<00:06:04.810> small<00:06:05.110> because<00:06:05.320> it<00:06:05.620> is<00:06:05.710> an<00:06:05.860> area

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
aren't too small because it is an area

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.950 
aren't too small because it is an area
it's<00:06:06.400> going<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.639> be<00:06:06.700> deformed<00:06:07.090> too<00:06:07.479> much<00:06:07.720> if

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
it's going to be deformed too much if

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.279 
it's going to be deformed too much if
it's<00:06:08.200> animated

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.749 

so<00:06:15.289> once<00:06:15.530> again<00:06:15.710> I'm<00:06:16.009> just<00:06:16.130> cleaning<00:06:16.430> up<00:06:16.580> my

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
so once again I'm just cleaning up my

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.300 
so once again I'm just cleaning up my
model<00:06:17.090> look<00:06:17.389> at<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:17.690> apology<00:06:18.289> of<00:06:18.320> it<00:06:18.560> making

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
model look at the apology of it making

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.939 
model look at the apology of it making
sure<00:06:19.699> that<00:06:20.090> there's<00:06:20.360> not<00:06:21.199> too<00:06:21.440> many<00:06:21.590> points

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
sure that there's not too many points

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.689 
sure that there's not too many points
that<00:06:22.789> end<00:06:23.060> up<00:06:23.300> in<00:06:23.449> a<00:06:23.509> triangle<00:06:23.930> or<00:06:24.699> that

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
that end up in a triangle or that

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.400 
that end up in a triangle or that
connect<00:06:26.169> via<00:06:27.169> 5<00:06:27.650> verse<00:06:28.280> 6<00:06:28.610> well<00:06:29.360> five<00:06:29.750> edges<00:06:29.990> on

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
connect via 5 verse 6 well five edges on

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:38.209 
connect via 5 verse 6 well five edges on
one<00:06:30.710> point<00:06:30.979> which<00:06:31.910> I<00:06:32.060> say<00:06:32.240> one<00:06:32.509> vertex

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:41.189 

okay<00:06:39.219> so<00:06:39.279> I'm<00:06:39.699> going<00:06:39.879> to<00:06:39.939> start<00:06:40.029> working<00:06:40.479> my

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
okay so I'm going to start working my

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.799 
okay so I'm going to start working my
way<00:06:41.229> along<00:06:41.619> to<00:06:41.799> the<00:06:41.889> back<00:06:42.039> of<00:06:42.069> the<00:06:42.219> head<00:06:42.429> now

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:42.809 
way along to the back of the head now

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:46.169 
way along to the back of the head now
look<00:06:43.809> my<00:06:43.989> way<00:06:44.139> up<00:06:44.229> up<00:06:44.439> from<00:06:44.469> the<00:06:44.949> ear<00:06:45.159> gonna<00:06:45.969> go

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:46.179 
look my way up up from the ear gonna go

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:49.589 
look my way up up from the ear gonna go
round<00:06:46.889> just<00:06:47.889> to<00:06:47.979> keep<00:06:48.219> that<00:06:48.459> flow<00:06:48.729> going<00:06:48.999> as

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
round just to keep that flow going as

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:54.379 
round just to keep that flow going as
well<00:06:50.319> as<00:06:50.379> make<00:06:50.739> my<00:06:50.919> way<00:06:51.099> to<00:06:51.729> the<00:06:51.759> back<00:06:52.059> slowly

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
well as make my way to the back slowly

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.139 
well as make my way to the back slowly
so<00:06:55.389> as<00:06:55.779> you<00:06:56.559> can<00:06:56.679> see<00:06:57.009> as<00:06:57.339> I'm<00:06:57.699> getting<00:06:57.879> further

00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:58.149 
so as you can see as I'm getting further

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:01.589 
so as you can see as I'm getting further
back<00:06:58.539> I'm<00:06:59.229> increasing<00:07:00.159> the<00:07:00.249> size<00:07:00.459> of<00:07:00.879> the

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
back I'm increasing the size of the

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.139 
back I'm increasing the size of the
topology<00:07:02.199> just<00:07:02.739> because<00:07:03.129> along<00:07:03.789> the<00:07:03.909> back<00:07:04.029> of

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.149 
topology just because along the back of

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:05.100 
topology just because along the back of
the<00:07:04.209> head<00:07:04.329> there's<00:07:04.509> not<00:07:04.629> going<00:07:04.749> to<00:07:04.809> be<00:07:04.869> much

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
the head there's not going to be much

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.519 
the head there's not going to be much
deformation<00:07:05.499> as<00:07:06.209> the<00:07:07.209> model<00:07:07.389> moves<00:07:07.779> if<00:07:08.079> it<00:07:08.409> is

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
deformation as the model moves if it is

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:21.630 
deformation as the model moves if it is
going<00:07:08.769> to<00:07:08.889> be<00:07:08.919> animated

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.730 

okay<00:07:22.640> so<00:07:22.700> I've<00:07:23.120> worked<00:07:23.360> is<00:07:23.600> pretty<00:07:24.050> much<00:07:24.230> down

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
okay so I've worked is pretty much down

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.390 
okay so I've worked is pretty much down
the<00:07:24.920> back<00:07:25.300> along<00:07:26.300> the<00:07:26.330> spinal<00:07:26.690> cord

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
the back along the spinal cord

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.530 
the back along the spinal cord
broadening<00:07:28.400> as<00:07:28.670> I<00:07:28.880> came<00:07:28.940> out<00:07:29.330> to<00:07:29.360> her

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540 
broadening as I came out to her

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.090 
broadening as I came out to her
shoulders<00:07:29.750> but<00:07:30.050> going<00:07:30.230> back<00:07:30.410> in<00:07:30.620> as<00:07:30.770> I<00:07:30.920> get<00:07:31.070> to

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
shoulders but going back in as I get to

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.730 
shoulders but going back in as I get to
the<00:07:31.220> center<00:07:31.520> and<00:07:31.730> bottom<00:07:32.150> of<00:07:32.270> the<00:07:32.300> back<00:07:32.740> once

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:33.740 
the center and bottom of the back once

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.160 
the center and bottom of the back once
again<00:07:33.890> keeping<00:07:34.370> to<00:07:34.580> the<00:07:34.700> actual<00:07:35.170> informations

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.170 
again keeping to the actual informations

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.030 
again keeping to the actual informations
of<00:07:36.350> the<00:07:36.590> structure<00:07:37.370> itself<00:07:37.490> and<00:07:38.860> keep<00:07:39.860> on

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.040 
of the structure itself and keep on

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.920 
of the structure itself and keep on
going<00:07:40.370> along<00:07:40.460> adding<00:07:40.940> the<00:07:41.060> topology<00:07:41.510> as<00:07:41.630> I<00:07:41.750> go

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930 
going along adding the topology as I go

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.960 
going along adding the topology as I go
along<00:07:42.050> once<00:07:42.590> again<00:07:42.770> I<00:07:43.190> can<00:07:43.430> use<00:07:43.610> the<00:07:43.730> brush

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:43.970 
along once again I can use the brush

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.150 
along once again I can use the brush
tool<00:07:44.210> afterwards<00:07:44.810> just<00:07:45.620> to<00:07:45.710> smooth<00:07:45.950> things

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 
tool afterwards just to smooth things

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.210 
tool afterwards just to smooth things
out<00:07:46.400> a<00:07:46.460> bit<00:07:46.580> but<00:07:47.450> for<00:07:47.690> now<00:07:47.720> I'm<00:07:48.680> just<00:07:48.740> trying<00:07:49.160> to

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.220 
out a bit but for now I'm just trying to

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.060 
out a bit but for now I'm just trying to
get<00:07:49.400> the<00:07:49.550> rough<00:07:49.760> shape<00:07:50.090> and<00:07:50.450> the<00:07:50.630> rough

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
get the rough shape and the rough

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.370 
get the rough shape and the rough
topology<00:07:52.070> of<00:07:52.250> how<00:07:52.820> the<00:07:53.330> Egyptian<00:07:53.870> look<00:07:54.080> along

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.380 
topology of how the Egyptian look along

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.490 
topology of how the Egyptian look along
this<00:07:54.500> back<00:07:55.540> okay<00:07:56.540> once<00:07:56.810> the<00:07:56.900> back<00:07:57.110> is<00:07:57.290> done

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.500 
this back okay once the back is done

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.720 
this back okay once the back is done
just<00:07:57.530> going<00:07:57.890> to<00:07:57.950> smooth<00:07:58.160> over<00:07:58.250> once<00:07:58.670> again

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:58.730 
just going to smooth over once again

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.170 
just going to smooth over once again
with<00:07:58.970> the<00:07:59.060> brush<00:07:59.300> tool<00:07:59.570> just<00:07:59.990> make<00:08:00.140> sure
