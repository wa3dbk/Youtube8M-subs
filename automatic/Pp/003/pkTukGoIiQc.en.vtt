00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
three sections so the way your braid is

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.510 
three sections so the way your braid is
similar<00:00:34.870> to<00:00:34.989> platting<00:00:35.410> we're<00:00:36.040> gonna<00:00:36.160> put<00:00:36.430> the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
similar to platting we're gonna put the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.280 
similar to platting we're gonna put the
left<00:00:36.760> over<00:00:37.060> the<00:00:37.180> middle<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.690> then<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.110> right

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
left over the middle and then the right

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.410 
left over the middle and then the right
over<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:38.740> middle<00:00:39.070> but<00:00:39.760> when<00:00:39.880> it<00:00:40.000> comes<00:00:40.240> to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
over the middle but when it comes to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.170 
over the middle but when it comes to
take<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.840> left<00:00:41.170> again<00:00:41.620> we're<00:00:42.370> going<00:00:42.520> to<00:00:42.760> add<00:00:43.150> a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
take the left again we're going to add a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.819 
take the left again we're going to add a
chunk<00:00:43.630> of<00:00:43.750> hair<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:47.320> means<00:00:47.590> that<00:00:47.680> we<00:00:47.800> are

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
chunk of hair this means that we are

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.440 
chunk of hair this means that we are
bringing<00:00:48.010> more<00:00:48.400> and<00:00:48.460> more<00:00:48.640> of<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> hair<00:00:49.150> into

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
bringing more and more of the hair into

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.229 
bringing more and more of the hair into
the<00:00:49.780> style<00:00:52.740> so<00:00:53.740> now<00:00:53.980> I'm<00:00:54.250> taking<00:00:54.520> a<00:00:54.880> chunk<00:00:55.150> of

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
the style so now I'm taking a chunk of

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.940 
the style so now I'm taking a chunk of
right<00:00:55.630> hair<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.290> adding<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.220> braid

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
right hair and adding it to the braid

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:08.109 
right hair and adding it to the braid
like<00:00:59.950> so

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.550 

now<00:01:09.119> I'm<00:01:09.299> taking<00:01:09.479> another<00:01:09.840> chunk<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
now I'm taking another chunk of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620 
now I'm taking another chunk of
left-half<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> adding<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.940> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> left<00:01:12.360> side

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
left-half and adding it on the left side

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
left-half and adding it on the left side
so<00:01:13.500> each<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:14.040> you'll<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> braid

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so each time you'll see that the braid

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
so each time you'll see that the braid
gets<00:01:15.540> thicker<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.050> thicker<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.860> hair

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
gets thicker and thicker the more hair

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
gets thicker and thicker the more hair
you<00:01:17.130> add<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.510> what<00:01:18.659> creates<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
you add and this is what creates the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.760
