00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.860
 hello I am what of the season welcome 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.960
 to the channel the things of the lola today I'm going 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.020
 to try to solve a problem of the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.110
 which they have been presented on the fly 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.259
 making the rings with the planchette 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.810
 nacar there were many people who told me 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.360
 that they could not do them because of the problem 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 that they did not find the iron 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.090
 then we have solved it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.460
 making the base with a button like this 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.559
 simple 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.329
 I took advantage of the fact that I made the ring 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.500
 to match the slope and comb of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.570
 flamenco 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.410
 and I wanted to do it with the button to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.630
 solve that problem we had with 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.870
 the subject of the planchette 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.170
 here you have it, you will see how easy it is 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.030
 wish 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.540
 we started in this case I chose this 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.080
 button because as it leads the hole towards 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 along and the flat wire the plane 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.210
 the tree is much better than a tree 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 little button round one from where I do not 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.940
 would be worth for this type of work 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.140
 then it is to make a very small 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.420
 twisting the wire so that it stumbles and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.770
 do not leave me the smallest thing that is 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.770
 can I put it 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.210
 through the holes and I have left yesterday here 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.630
 Now I have to put the stick of the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.630
 measure 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.159
 I put it in seven and a half 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.650
 and I go through the next hole in the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.650
 button 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.439
 and stretched out 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.159
 to the size of my son who tried it 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.330
 it is a little bit big but as if 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.640
 I'm going to do 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.480
 the rule and toa and always with the curler 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.050
 I have the option d 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.040
 to balance vale 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.030
 then I will cut approximately 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.010
 here and I'm going to do the same curly 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.580
 and now I have here the glue of two 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.000
 components 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 he asks me there all the people what kind 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.640
 of glue after they are the same 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.830
 it does not matter the brand as long as it's two 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.100
 components because that's what it does 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.920
 that when mixing the two is hard I 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.540
 I put two parts 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.450
 as you know I do it's okay 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.959
 is already beginning to take hold and now 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.349
 I put here a little in the center and I'm going 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.290
 to put this elongated account that is the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.860
 that goes with my bodice and with the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.200
 belt of my suit 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.050
 you see that it enters perfectly there is always 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.100
 to choose the pieces so that 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.100
 fit well 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.420
 well coupled and now I start to put 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.870
 here in the inner part of the ring a 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.459
 little of this glue procuring 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.460
 stain on the outside part the least 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.950
 possible this is going to be 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.440
 so much that it sticks on the stones in the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.130
 inside as it takes hold in what 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.610
 has already done both the wire and the 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.480
 button to the hoop 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 Now I start to put the pebbles 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.250
 I'm helping if I need with the clamp and 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.700
 yes no, as you can see with your own finger 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.620
 the biggest the smallest 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.620
 as we go 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.700
 squaring well 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.099
 if we see that we need some piece 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.060
 smaller remember that here we have 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.459
 those that are crushed 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.770
 of coffee grinder that are a 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.590
 wonder why we make lots 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.840
 little chiquitinas to be able 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.280
 keep coupling here to these 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.050
 little eggs 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.850
 my mother how happy I was 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.350
 made for the fair with my set 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.750
 full to see how nice 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.940
 what will it look like and how easy it is 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.340
 I often say if I am 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.760
 very clumsy since I did not come here for the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.730
 10 that nothing there is no blows to there is lack of 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.610
 will you already know that you have to put 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.040
 a droplet to join the pebbles between 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.430
 yes and secure because the bottom part 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.500
 it's fine unit but this part of 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.660
 above you have to join the also while 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.240
 more security you have 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.420
 much better is already in all 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 pebbles placed with what he does to 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.780
 I play with the other two things and good 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.670
 rounded the ring and there is the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.870
 completed work 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.810
 simple you could see me very easy 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.460
 Do not ever have a problem 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.010
 when it comes to finding buttons because 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.310
 over all the site of the world there is 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:34.150
 is the big lift and I like my 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.150
 ticket and to the game for the point 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.590
