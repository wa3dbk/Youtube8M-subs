 Hi, I'm Raquel DomÃ­nguez from www.operacionbikini.es and today I'm here to talk to you about 10 foods 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.660
 that will help you get rid of cellulite 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.920
 Cellulite ... you will not be able to do it with us. 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.449
 Water: water is not a food as such but is the basis of any anti-cellulitis diet, 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.640
 it does not matter what anti-cellulite diet you do, that if you do not drink enough water, it will not work. 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.000
 The reason ?, very simple, water helps us eliminate toxins that favor the accumulation 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.430
 of fats. And if we do not drink enough water then we will cause our body to retain 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 liquids, which will further aggravate cellulite. 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.700
 A plus, if you want to improve the condition of your cellulite and health in general, it is very 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.629
 good idea to start the day by drinking a glass of water with lemon, in this video 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.850
 I explain why. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.629
 Rosemary: rosemary is one of those spices that you can not miss in your kitchen because 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.900
 to give a very special touch to your dishes and that are delicious, helps take care of your 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 health and eliminate cellulite. The rosemary what it does is that the toxins that accumulate 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.330
 under the skin, those that cause these odious holes of cellulite to form, 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.070
 because they do not accumulate there, it also stimulates circulation and helps us to digest 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 fats. 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.700
 The bananas: ay the bananas that bad bananas have with how good they are. The bananas 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.520
 Although they are known to fatten a lot, they will help us a lot in the battle 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 against cellulite The reason? Because they have a lot of potassium, which helps us counteract 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.360
 the sodium of the body and eliminate liquids, that way we eliminate the toxins that we 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.670
 they provoke the skin of orange. The banana also have many more benefits, in this video 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.440
 I explain why you should eat bananas. 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.200
 Sunflower seeds: sunflower seeds are replete with nutrients, they have vitamin 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 E, B6 and minerals such as potassium, selenium and zinc, how do seeds act? 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.980
 sunflower on cellulite? they help us to strengthen and repair the cognitive tissue, 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.290
 and it is also a diuretic food, as well as those that I have already explained before 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.840
 It helps eliminate the toxins that cause cellulite. But ... ojito, the seeds 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.379
 sunflower, despite being great for cellulite have many calories, as well 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.280
 that you eat them with moderation, with prudence. 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.400
 Papaya: papaya is not just a tropical fruit that is delicious, papaya is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.099
 perfect for the fight against cellulite, the reason ?, because they have an enzyme that 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.900
 it is called papain that what it does is fractionating the proteins that are at the origin of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.120
 cellulite and eliminates fat accumulations. Also if you have painful cellulitis, 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.640
 which causes edema, as it has anti-inflammatory action will help you to treat it. 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.849
 The kiwi: the kiwi is the fruit richest in vitamin C, and vitamin C is one of the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.579
 greatest allies that exist in the fight against cellulite, how does vitamin C work? 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.269
 against cellulite ?, because on the one hand it improves the tissues of the subcutaneous cells 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.720
 and also strengthens the walls of blood vessels, in addition vitamin C improves 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.349
 much the appearance of the skin, because it is present in the process of collagen formation, 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.019
 and you know that the weaker the collagen, the more you notice cellulite. further 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.040
 Vitamin C also decreases inflammation. Spicy foods: I have to recognize 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.029
 I'm in luck here because I love spiciness, and spicy foods 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:43.489
 like chili or cayenne, they have a compound called capsaicin (or as pronounced) 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.909
 that besides causing us those sweats we have when we eat very spicy foods, 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:55.529
 It also has an active substance that helps to break down brown fat, which is the most 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:04:01.650
 rebel, in addition there is a study of the University of Maastricht, which in the Netherlands, which demonstrates 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.060
 that this compound decreases body lipids by a mechanism that motivates 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.209
 the cell death of immature fat cells. Of course, if you do not want to have problems of 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.350
 Sleep is best not to take spicy at night, better during the day. 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.130
 The jenjible, the jenjible is a very effective root against overweight, because for a 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.360
 part accelerates our metabolism, so we consume more calories even if we are 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.090
 rest, but it also decreases appetite, so we eat less and spend more, then 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.950
 the weight loss is almost almost assured, also helps us against cellulite because 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.160
 improves blood circulation and you know that many times the culprit of cellulite 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.250
 it is precisely poor circulation. 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.280
 The eggs: the eggs are another one of those foods with a bad reputation that can not be missing in our 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.420
 food because they are very rich nutritionally, besides being a great source of protein, 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.760
 They have a good lipid profile, because they have more unsaturated fats, which are good, 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.853
 that saturated, which are bad, also have many nutrients among which 

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:08.650
 they find vitamins and minerals, among the minerals they have, iron is found, 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.540
 iodine and zinc, which help us improve the state of cellulite. Yes, if you 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.790
 you eat fried I do not think cellulite improves. And if you have doubts about whether you have to 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.380
 Eat or not eggs do not miss this video. Brazil nuts: Brazil nuts 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.381
 how rich they are, and they are also the main source of selenium, a mineral that helps us 

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.690
 in the fight against cellulite because it improves the state of the skin and decreases the effect 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.690
 of orange skin. 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:44.420
 And now that you know that 10 foods help you fight cellulite ... bye, bye
