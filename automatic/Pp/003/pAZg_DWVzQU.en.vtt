though it's not a big ugly wing is

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.319 
though it's not a big ugly wing is
actually<00:00:33.930> designed<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.620> high-speed<00:00:35.329> same

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
actually designed for high-speed same

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
actually designed for high-speed same
thing<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.600> true<00:00:36.629> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> rocker<00:00:37.530> extensions

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
thing is true of the rocker extensions

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
thing is true of the rocker extensions
here<00:00:38.370> their<00:00:38.579> carbon<00:00:39.000> fiber<00:00:39.590> they<00:00:40.590> help<00:00:40.829> keep

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here their carbon fiber they help keep

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.819 
here their carbon fiber they help keep
the<00:00:41.190> car<00:00:41.370> planted<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.269> eliminate<00:00:42.809> lift<00:00:43.109> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the car planted they eliminate lift the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
the car planted they eliminate lift the
roof<00:00:44.039> is<00:00:44.280> made<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.640> carbon<00:00:44.940> fiber<00:00:45.320> because

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
roof is made of carbon fiber because

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
roof is made of carbon fiber because
it's<00:00:46.500> lightweight<00:00:46.710> same<00:00:47.489> thing<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> hood

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's lightweight same thing of the hood

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's lightweight same thing of the hood
you<00:00:48.269> can't<00:00:48.480> tell<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> outside<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.859> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you can't tell from the outside but it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.380 
you can't tell from the outside but it
is<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.370> helps<00:00:51.030> keep<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.359> weight

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
is like helps keep the weight

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
is like helps keep the weight
distribution<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.500> again<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.160> the

putting<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.899> top<00:01:16.140> obviously<00:01:16.950> added<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
putting that on top obviously added to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.580 
putting that on top obviously added to
the<00:01:17.340> height<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.729> engines<00:01:18.060> of

the height of the engines of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.889 
the height of the engines of
cool<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.670> exchanges<00:01:20.149> are<00:01:20.299> very<00:01:20.479> small

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
cool so the exchanges are very small

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.380 
cool so the exchanges are very small
they<00:01:21.590> still<00:01:21.979> have<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.399> redesign<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.850> hood<00:01:23.030> now

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
the other but the real secret is the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.119 
the other but the real secret is the
computer<00:02:44.629> is<00:02:44.810> monitoring<00:02:45.319> your<00:02:45.950> wheel

computer is monitoring your wheel
position<00:02:46.280> all<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.909> time<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.689> car<00:02:47.870> is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
position all the time what the car is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.770 
position all the time what the car is
doing<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.469> basically<00:02:49.189> optimizes<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.599> shock

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780

doing and basically optimizes the shock
absorber<00:02:51.230> firmness<00:02:51.469> for<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.489> track<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.030> it

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
absorber firmness for the track and it

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.349 
absorber firmness for the track and it
makes<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.170> handling<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.769> much<00:02:54.980> better<00:02:55.359> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
makes the handling that much better the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.270 
makes the handling that much better the
main<00:02:56.540> drawback<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.170> my<00:02:57.349> mind<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.010> interior

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
main drawback in my mind is the interior

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.550 
main drawback in my mind is the interior
quality<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.970> decent<00:02:59.180> but<00:02:59.720> it's<00:03:00.019> not<00:03:00.200> terrific

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
quality is decent but it's not terrific

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.500 
quality is decent but it's not terrific
for<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> car<00:03:01.129> that<00:03:01.159> costs<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.640> much<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
for a car that costs this much and the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.059 
for a car that costs this much and the
interesting<00:03:02.870> thing<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.049> GM<00:03:03.409> has<00:03:03.590> improved<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
interesting thing is GM has improved the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.649 
interesting thing is GM has improved the
interiors<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.760> much<00:03:05.000> even<00:03:05.420> though<00:03:05.510> they

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
interiors so much even though they

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.140 
interiors so much even though they
dialed<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.079> one<00:03:06.290> up<00:03:06.439> quite<00:03:06.799> a<00:03:06.829> bit<00:03:07.099> it's<00:03:07.849> just

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
dialed this one up quite a bit it's just

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.899 
dialed this one up quite a bit it's just
not<00:03:08.239> as<00:03:08.599> good<00:03:08.780> as<00:03:09.049> some<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.319> their<00:03:09.409> best<00:03:09.560> work

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
not as good as some of their best work

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.910 
not as good as some of their best work
so<00:03:10.909> in<00:03:11.030> terms<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:11.510> driving<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.769> is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
so in terms of the driving this is

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.589 
so in terms of the driving this is
definitely<00:03:13.159> a<00:03:13.489> supercar<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.389> in<00:03:14.510> the

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
definitely a supercar but in the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.629 
definitely a supercar but in the
supercar<00:03:15.019> market<00:03:15.439> there's<00:03:15.859> more<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.310> it's

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
supercar market there's more to it it's

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.099 
supercar market there's more to it it's
not<00:03:16.819> just<00:03:17.090> about<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.389> performance<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:17.930> about

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
not just about to performance it's about

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.800 
not just about to performance it's about
the<00:03:18.260> look<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.769> exclusivity<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:20.629> zr1

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
the look and the exclusivity and the zr1

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.140 
the look and the exclusivity and the zr1
strength<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.769> its<00:03:22.010> weakness<00:03:22.400> it's<00:03:22.639> a<00:03:22.730> Corvette

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
strength is its weakness it's a Corvette

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.119 
strength is its weakness it's a Corvette
so<00:03:23.720> even<00:03:23.989> though<00:03:24.019> there<00:03:24.379> are<00:03:24.590> elections<00:03:24.829> for
