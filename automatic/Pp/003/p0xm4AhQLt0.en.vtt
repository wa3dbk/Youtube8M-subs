00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Do not tell me… 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 It is logical that you doubt it. It is more: anyone in his place would say that this is a trick to not pay the rent, right? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Now, if he wants to grab my daughter and take her to the street, with all the forty degrees of temperature that the poor thing has. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Forty? 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 The same as more. Of course, the doctors have told me that I should not lose faith, that I may be saved. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Well, yes, what does the girl have? 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 Well, they have not hit him. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.300
 Don Ramón, if this is not true ... 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 Let him die if it is not true. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 What? 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 I mean, I say, that, yes, it's true. Look, I swear it for my father who was on the ground. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Do you work as a miner? 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 What happened? What happened? Come on there? 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
 Well, look, I studied a little medicine. I'm going to see it. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Yes No No. I mean, yes, you better enter. Let's see if you hit him. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 Because the doctors have told me that, in addition, it is a very contagious disease. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Contagious? 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 Yes. I do not know if you were hit by scab or smallpox. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Well, I think that thinking the best, another day I collect the rent again. Total, fourteen months you pay me when you want. Excuse me. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Thank you very much, Mrs. Florinda. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 There's no need, Mr. Barriga. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 What's going on? What's going on? 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 …professor Jirafales… 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Dona Florinda ... 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Oh! On my knees before me. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.500
 Oh! Yes, beautiful Agnes. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Look here at your plants, then, all the haughty vigor that surrendering did not believe. Worshiping, my life, the bondage of your love. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Shut up, by God, don Juan! Well I will not be able to resist, long without dying so never felt desire. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 I came to bring you this humble gift. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Oh, Professor Jirafales, she's so beautiful. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Well, not as much as you. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Oh, thanks. But do not like to go for a cup of coffee? 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 If it's not too much trouble, yes. But first, I would like to spend a little minute at Don Ramón's house. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 With that? 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Yes, I want to know how the girl continues. 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.000
 How does it continue? 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 Is that in the morning he did not go to class and sent to say with Chavo that she was sick. 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 Yes, but she told me to tell her without saying that she was the one who told me to tell her. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.200
 A little bit, a little bit. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 You want to tell me they were talking about Chilindrina? 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.000
 That she did not go to class today and sent word that she was sick. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 You see why it squeaks all day. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 With ra ... 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 What I want to know is this: is Chilindrine sick, yes or no? 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 The Chilindrin, sick? Of course… 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 ... yes. Yes, yes, the poor thing is very serious. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.500
 The smallpox is very contagious. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.500
 Yes. 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.000
 Do you have smallpox? 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 Unfortunately. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Take off, Treasure. Do not hit it. And do not join this rabble. 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.000
 Yes mom. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Chusma, rabble. 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 And the same you, Professor Jirafales. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.200
 Yes, Mrs. Florinda. 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.000
 Chusma, chu ... with permission, Don Ramón. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Mr. Barriga. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 With permission, I have to go collect. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 What about you? 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.700
 What what? 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.300
 Why do not you go? 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Well, I wanted to see if the Chilindrina gives me one. 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 One that? 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.000
 Is that the Chilindrina has servants. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.500
 They are not servants, they are smallpox. And by the way very small pocks. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Chilindrine 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 With what pox, right? 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 The idea was yours, dad. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 I say no? 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.000
 I want to go out and play with Chavo. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 I already told you that you can not leave. Remember that you are very sick. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And I do not want shrieks. 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.000
 Already!
