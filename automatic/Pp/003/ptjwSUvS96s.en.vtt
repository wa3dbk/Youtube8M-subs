00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello in this video I show you how 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 you can make christmas stars 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.900
 for that you need eight small leaves 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.590
 which are 95 cm long and 45 cm wide 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 have to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:23.449
 He first bends the leaf once 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.490
 in the middle long it works out again 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:35.520
 and now all four corners bend 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:38.480
 once to the middle line should the other 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.480
 page up 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.070
 if you did that you pick up 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.260
 one side the corners again and 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.739
 kinks this one knew here again 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.739
 center line 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.500
 Now your folded piece sees leaf 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.680
 from the back so and from the front so that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.580
 makes it eight times I have the times 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.740
 prepared and now you put the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.039
 individual parts of the star together 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.429
 Here is the top hre tip always 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.300
 outside sets out your first part 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:34.840
 and now you need a second part 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:40.270
 and that's what you put in here 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.850
 the center line of your first piece like that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.619
 that they are pointed at each other here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.619
 and stick it all tight now 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.000
 we simply take a liquid for that 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.190
 as liver or a brit pin and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.489
 Carry the glue here on the first one 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:06.399
 piece up and puts as I just now 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:12.220
 explained the second piece here 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:14.140
 the center line and then it goes with it 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.640
 the next piece just the same 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.680
 will be back here at the center line 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.150
 applied and glued 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.360
 if you all share except the last 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.239
 stuck you have the same again 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.269
 glue on and now there is a small 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.459
 special feature you stick the last piece 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.780
 stuck again 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:41.290
 but you have to do half and yours 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:46.470
 first piece of peace and then he is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.470
 christmas poinsettia finished
