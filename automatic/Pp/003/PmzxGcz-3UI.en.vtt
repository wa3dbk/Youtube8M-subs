00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
for doing that like Laurie and in the

walk and Walking Dead exactly especially

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.080 
walk and Walking Dead exactly especially
in<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.330> first<00:05:09.539> season<00:05:09.780> now<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:11.030> thought<00:05:12.030> that

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
in the first season now I thought that

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.870 
in the first season now I thought that
they<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.690> thought<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.139> there<00:05:13.319> was<00:05:13.409> a<00:05:13.880> reason

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
they I thought that there was a reason

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.930 
they I thought that there was a reason
for<00:05:14.909> calling<00:05:15.360> Laurie<00:05:15.630> okay<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.550> it's<00:05:17.759> funny

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
for calling Laurie okay and it's funny

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.219 
for calling Laurie okay and it's funny
because<00:05:18.000> people<00:05:18.509> do<00:05:18.690> kind<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:18.960> throw<00:05:19.080> that

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
because people do kind of throw that

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.540 
because people do kind of throw that
word<00:05:19.380> around<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.680> lot<00:05:19.710> yeah<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.009> know<00:05:20.099> we<00:05:20.280> have<00:05:20.430> on

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550

this<00:05:20.729> show<00:05:20.909> but<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:22.130> just<00:05:23.130> don't<00:05:23.280> think

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
this show but I I just don't think

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.689 
this show but I I just don't think
Laurie<00:05:23.729> was<00:05:23.940> written<00:05:24.240> very<00:05:24.479> well<00:05:24.569> yeah<00:05:25.669> so<00:05:26.669> I

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
Laurie was written very well yeah so I
