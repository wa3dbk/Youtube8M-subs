00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:47.900 
one as you can see the gold is on this
when<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.220> golden<00:02:47.519> really<00:02:47.730> really

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
when I like the golden really really

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.789 
when I like the golden really really
cool<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.390> also<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.170> diamond<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.680> as

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
cool I also do like the diamond one as

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.680

well it is quite bright looks pretty
cool<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:52.980> one<00:02:53.160> looks<00:02:53.280> best<00:02:53.640> on<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.729 
cool I think this one looks best on the
dark<00:02:54.209> horse<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.989> guess<00:02:55.380> they<00:02:55.470> were<00:02:55.590> to

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
dark horse so I guess they were to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.050 
dark horse so I guess they were to
switch<00:02:55.860> these<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.849> quickly

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
switch these like then we just quickly

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780 
switch these like then we just quickly
switch<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.930> switch<00:02:58.920> oh<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.459> didn't<00:02:59.730> mean

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
switch this and switch oh I didn't mean

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.670 
switch this and switch oh I didn't mean
to<00:02:59.940> do<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:00.569> gonna<00:03:00.810> get<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.440> one<00:03:01.650> off

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
to do that I'm gonna get this one off

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.440 
to do that I'm gonna get this one off
here<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.579> we're<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.849> switch<00:03:03.120> them<00:03:03.299> so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
here and we're going to switch them so

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.630 
here and we're going to switch them so
the<00:03:03.569> gold<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.200> there<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.489> can

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the gold can go on there and then we can

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.970 
the gold can go on there and then we can
put<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.090> diamond<00:03:06.599> on<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.049> one<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.470> think<00:03:07.890> it

used to be able to craft it and used to
be<00:03:22.440> other<00:03:22.590> stack<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.280> can't<00:03:23.519> anymore

was introduced after the Allsup day it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.910 
was introduced after the Allsup day it
wasn't<00:03:39.569> available<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.230> start<00:03:40.500> but<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.709> can

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
wasn't available at the start but it can

be enchanted I'm gonna do that in just a
second<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.889> works<00:03:44.069> very<00:03:44.310> similar<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
second and but it works very similar to

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.849 
second and but it works very similar to
wear<00:03:45.000> armor<00:03:45.299> works<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.350> human<00:03:46.709> or

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
wear armor works on like the human or

wear armor works on like the human or
your<00:03:46.980> Minecraft<00:03:47.430> character<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:48.690> example

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
your Minecraft character so for example
