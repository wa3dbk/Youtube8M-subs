00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
the actual weight it says on here that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.750 
the actual weight it says on here that
it's<00:02:02.780> 10<00:02:03.020> pounds<00:02:03.440> but<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.130> don't<00:02:04.430> think<00:02:04.550> it's

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
it's 10 pounds but I don't think it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.940 
it's 10 pounds but I don't think it's
that<00:02:04.940> heavy<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.740> little<00:02:06.830> bit

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
that heavy I think it's a little bit

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.120 
that heavy I think it's a little bit
less<00:02:07.250> than<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.610> maybe<00:02:07.899> eight<00:02:09.009> seven<00:02:10.009> or

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
less than that maybe eight seven or

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.980 
less than that maybe eight seven or
eight<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.490> don't<00:02:11.090> think<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.450> heavy<00:02:11.720> it's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
eight I don't think it's that heavy it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.490 
eight I don't think it's that heavy it's
it's<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.530> lot<00:02:12.770> lighter<00:02:13.010> than<00:02:13.160> Les<00:02:13.520> Paul<00:02:17.500> all

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
a lot more inductance and resistance

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.130 
a lot more inductance and resistance
than<00:02:51.680> not<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.610> rhythm<00:02:52.880> pick<00:02:53.000> up<00:02:53.209> it's<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.959> lot

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
than not the rhythm pick up it's a lot

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.880 
than not the rhythm pick up it's a lot
hotter<00:02:54.670> some<00:02:55.670> people<00:02:55.910> would<00:02:55.970> say<00:02:56.800> that's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.289 

about<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:01.730> I'm<00:03:01.820> going<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.030> go<00:03:02.150> ahead<00:03:02.209> and

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
about it so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
the second half of part 2 trying to get

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.240 
the second half of part 2 trying to get
a<00:03:17.870> good<00:03:18.019> angle<00:03:18.140> here<00:03:18.410> you're<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.190> see

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
a good angle here you're going to see

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.270 
a good angle here you're going to see
the<00:03:19.430> shine<00:03:19.670> on<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:19.970> thing<00:03:20.590> not<00:03:21.590> unevenness

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
the shine on this thing not unevenness

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.900 
the shine on this thing not unevenness
in<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.519> body<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:22.940> okay<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.730> real

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
in the body but okay this is just a real

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.670 
in the body but okay this is just a real
clean<00:03:26.150> channel

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.190 

i'm<00:03:29.549> using<00:03:29.969> the<00:03:30.090> rhythm<00:03:30.510> pick<00:03:30.629> up<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.049> neck

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
i'm using the rhythm pick up or the neck

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.020 
i'm using the rhythm pick up or the neck
pickup<00:03:31.379> top<00:03:32.250> position<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.939> toggle<00:03:33.930> switch

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
pickup top position in the toggle switch

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.030 
pickup top position in the toggle switch
i'll<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.359> do<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> couple<00:03:37.200> chord<00:03:37.560> progressions

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
i'll just do a couple chord progressions

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.309 
i'll just do a couple chord progressions
so<00:03:38.189> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.400> get<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.670> feel<00:03:38.909> of<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:39.319> rhythm

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
so you can get the feel of the rhythm

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.610 
so you can get the feel of the rhythm
and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:41.519> i'll<00:03:41.730> uh<00:03:41.760> i'll<00:03:42.390> show<00:03:43.349> you<00:03:43.409> how<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and then i'll uh i'll show you how the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.500 
and then i'll uh i'll show you how the
tremolo<00:03:44.040> works<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.519> stuff<00:03:45.000> i'll<00:03:45.239> show<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
tremolo works and stuff i'll show you

00:03:45.510 --> 00:04:24.810 
tremolo works and stuff i'll show you
some<00:03:45.689> cool<00:03:46.109> stuff

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.270 

as<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:26.000> can<00:04:26.090> see<00:04:26.300> in<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> rhythm<00:04:27.280> setting

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
as you can see in the rhythm setting

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600 
as you can see in the rhythm setting
it's<00:04:28.970> really<00:04:29.800> it's<00:04:30.800> not<00:04:30.950> really<00:04:31.010> toned<00:04:31.400> down

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
it's really it's not really toned down

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.080 
it's really it's not really toned down
but<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.420> got<00:04:32.630> more<00:04:33.230> of<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.550> mellow<00:04:34.550> tone<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.060> it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
but it's got more of a mellow tone to it

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.610 
but it's got more of a mellow tone to it
I<00:04:35.240> guess<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.600> if<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.780> turn<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.080> tone<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.470> we

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
I guess and if you turn the tone and we

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:51.730 
I guess and if you turn the tone and we
down

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.159 

and<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.129> like<00:04:53.490> using<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.819> setting<00:04:54.180> for<00:04:54.210> playing

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
and I like using the setting for playing

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.950 
and I like using the setting for playing
blues<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.710> stuff<00:04:56.120> without<00:04:57.120> any<00:04:57.479> crunch<00:04:57.750> of

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
blues and stuff without any crunch of

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.109 
blues and stuff without any crunch of
course<00:04:58.199> so

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:03.119 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.040 

the<00:05:04.119> tremolo<00:05:04.509> it's<00:05:04.749> just<00:05:06.689> all<00:05:07.689> of<00:05:07.839> you<00:05:07.930> have

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
the tremolo it's just all of you have

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.959 
the tremolo it's just all of you have
probably<00:05:08.139> used<00:05:08.469> one<00:05:08.680> before<00:05:08.800> it's<00:05:09.159> not<00:05:09.369> it's

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
probably used one before it's not it's

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.219 
probably used one before it's not it's
not<00:05:10.119> really<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.419> much<00:05:10.479> different<00:05:11.050> it's<00:05:11.169> just

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
not really that much different it's just

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.320 
not really that much different it's just
got<00:05:11.499> a<00:05:11.529> really<00:05:11.710> great<00:05:11.949> action<00:05:12.219> you<00:05:13.089> don't<00:05:13.210> have

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
got a really great action you don't have

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.480 
got a really great action you don't have
to<00:05:13.419> put<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.599> lot<00:05:13.719> of<00:05:13.749> pressure<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.199> get<00:05:14.349> a<00:05:14.559> wide

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
to put a lot of pressure to get a wide

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:26.090 
to put a lot of pressure to get a wide
variety<00:05:15.789> of<00:05:16.059> tone<00:05:16.300> changes

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:45.220 

you

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.080 

all<00:05:46.230> right<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.980> middle<00:05:47.220> position<00:05:47.610> I'm<00:05:47.850> using

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
all right the middle position I'm using

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.870 
all right the middle position I'm using
a<00:05:48.330> crappy<00:05:48.630> amp<00:05:48.990> at<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.500> moment<00:05:49.830> came<00:05:50.550> with<00:05:50.730> my

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
a crappy amp at the moment came with my

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.690 
a crappy amp at the moment came with my
other<00:05:50.970> guitar<00:05:51.450> which<00:05:52.230> I'm<00:05:53.190> doing<00:05:53.400> something

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
other guitar which I'm doing something

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.160 
other guitar which I'm doing something
very<00:05:54.030> special<00:05:54.270> with<00:05:54.450> that<00:05:54.780> I'll<00:05:54.930> show<00:05:55.080> you

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
very special with that I'll show you

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.610 
very special with that I'll show you
guys<00:05:55.290> in<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.680> few<00:05:55.830> days<00:05:56.210> anyway<00:05:57.210> so<00:05:58.140> it's<00:05:58.440> not

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
guys in a few days anyway so it's not

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.050 
guys in a few days anyway so it's not
it's<00:05:59.040> not<00:05:59.130> great<00:05:59.490> it's<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.700> modelling

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
it's not great it's a modelling

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.250 
it's not great it's a modelling
amplifier<00:06:00.450> so<00:06:00.660> it<00:06:00.720> doesn't<00:06:00.930> have<00:06:01.020> very<00:06:01.080> good

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
amplifier so it doesn't have very good

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.940 
amplifier so it doesn't have very good
sound<00:06:01.530> anyway<00:06:01.830> but<00:06:02.700> um<00:06:03.530> you<00:06:04.530> can't<00:06:04.770> really

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
sound anyway but um you can't really

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.570 
sound anyway but um you can't really
tell<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.430> difference<00:06:05.460> between

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:25.890 

I<00:06:09.639> mean

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.240 

all<00:06:26.900> right<00:06:27.080> so<00:06:27.260> that<00:06:27.410> Amy<00:06:27.680> this<00:06:27.830> is<00:06:27.980> the<00:06:28.040> middle

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
all right so that Amy this is the middle

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.980 
all right so that Amy this is the middle
position<00:06:28.610> middle<00:06:29.240> treble<00:06:29.450> are<00:06:29.690> about<00:06:29.840> the

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
position middle treble are about the

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.450 
position middle treble are about the
same<00:06:30.170> with<00:06:30.560> the<00:06:30.710> same<00:06:31.450> alright<00:06:32.450> so<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:34.220> middle

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
same with the same alright so the middle

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.610 
same with the same alright so the middle
positions<00:06:34.850> on<00:06:35.180> something<00:06:35.480> like<00:06:35.570> this<00:06:35.750> it's<00:06:36.560> a

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
positions on something like this it's a

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:45.210 
positions on something like this it's a
lot<00:06:36.800> more<00:06:36.830> full<00:06:37.340> using<00:06:38.240> both<00:06:38.390> pickups<00:06:42.340> so

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
lot more full using both pickups so

00:06:45.220 --> 00:07:16.370 
lot more full using both pickups so
let's<00:06:46.220> see

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.290 

you

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:56.470 

volume<00:07:22.300> controls<00:07:22.690> are<00:07:22.840> really<00:07:23.110> sensitive

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:56.480 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.820 

alright<00:07:57.480> so<00:07:57.660> that's<00:07:57.780> that<00:07:58.140> now<00:07:58.410> i'm<00:07:58.500> going<00:07:58.680> to

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:58.830 
alright so that's that now i'm going to

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.200 
alright so that's that now i'm going to
go<00:07:58.920> ahead<00:07:58.950> and<00:07:59.130> stop<00:07:59.670> the<00:07:59.790> video<00:07:59.880> again<00:08:00.090> and

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.210 
go ahead and stop the video again and

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.560 
go ahead and stop the video again and
