with<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> controller<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.990> might

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
with the controller I know this might

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.189 
with the controller I know this might
seem<00:00:28.820> cheesy<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.119> some<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.840> me<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
seem cheesy to some but for me the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.870 
seem cheesy to some but for me the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
haptic feedback on the controller the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
haptic feedback on the controller the
vibration<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> gives<00:00:33.899> adds<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.739> little

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
vibration that it gives adds that little

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.340 
vibration that it gives adds that little
extra<00:00:35.370> something<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.809> provides<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
extra something to it it just provides a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
extra something to it it just provides a
certain<00:00:37.559> weight<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.660> like

out<00:00:56.340> strategies<00:00:56.910> I've<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> say

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
out strategies I've got to say

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.450 
out strategies I've got to say
internally<00:00:58.379> while<00:00:58.559> I'm<00:00:58.680> watching<00:00:58.829> people<00:00:59.309> do

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
internally while I'm watching people do

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
internally while I'm watching people do
are<00:00:59.850> more<00:01:00.270> difficult<00:01:00.480> dungeons<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.170> trials

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
are more difficult dungeons or trials

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.250 
are more difficult dungeons or trials
I've<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.430> been<00:01:02.550> surprised<00:01:03.059> by<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.989> easily

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I've really been surprised by how easily

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.310 
I've really been surprised by how easily
they're<00:01:04.619> able<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.080> because

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
they're able to do it you know because

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.520 
they're able to do it you know because
the<00:01:08.119> plane<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.270> controller<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.380> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the plane with controller you know for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
the plane with controller you know for
some<00:01:10.680> people<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> challenge<00:01:11.909> but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
some people is actually a challenge but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
some people is actually a challenge but
I<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> way<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> we've<00:01:13.560> set<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I think the way that we've set up the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.560 
I think the way that we've set up the
control<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> team<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.090> particular<00:01:15.299> has

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
control of the team in particular has

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
control of the team in particular has
worked<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:16.110> hard<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:16.950> sure<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> those

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
worked very hard to make sure that those

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.880 
worked very hard to make sure that those
controls<00:01:18.090> feel<00:01:18.600> good<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> game<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
controls feel good with the game and you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
controls feel good with the game and you
guys<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.369> seeing<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.820> everything<00:01:21.270> that

version so if you want to see like hey
does<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> work<00:01:26.729> how<00:01:27.299> does<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> UI<00:01:27.720> look<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
does it work how does the UI look you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.170 
does it work how does the UI look you
know<00:01:29.070> Paul<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.610> touched<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
know Paul I think you touched on it the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
know Paul I think you touched on it the
biggest<00:01:30.479> difference<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.900> me<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> started

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
biggest difference for me when I started

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.550 
biggest difference for me when I started
playing<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.909> how<00:01:33.270> streamlined<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.110> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
playing it was how streamlined it is you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
playing it was how streamlined it is you
know<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> very<00:01:35.579> big<00:01:36.030> shift<00:01:36.420> from

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
know that it is a very big shift from

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.649 
know that it is a very big shift from
going<00:01:36.990> from<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.680> pc<00:01:38.100> product<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> console

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
going from a pc product to a console

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.440 
going from a pc product to a console
product<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.400> sort<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> unifying<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.180> that

is a sort of cleaner simpler thing in

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.609 
is a sort of cleaner simpler thing in
some<00:01:57.270> respects<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.020> has<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.409> just

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
some respects because it has to be just

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
some respects because it has to be just
like<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> don't<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
like with the you know you don't have a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
like with the you know you don't have a
keyboard<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.750> chat<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.020> you've<00:02:01.770> got<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> use

keyboard to chat with you've got to use

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.999 
keyboard to chat with you've got to use
voice<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.390> does<00:02:03.630> sort<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> streamline<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
voice so it does sort of streamline and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
voice so it does sort of streamline and
simplify<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> respects<00:02:06.299> because

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
simplify in a lot of respects because

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240 
simplify in a lot of respects because
you<00:02:06.689> don't<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.200> don't<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> luxury<00:02:07.979> of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
to simplify it down and make

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600 
to simplify it down and make
sure<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:14.260> easy<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.890> navigate<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.490> easy

sure that it's easy to navigate and easy

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.760 
sure that it's easy to navigate and easy
to<00:02:15.850> use<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.510> certainly<00:02:17.140> found<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.740> be

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
to use and I certainly found that to be

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.830 
to use and I certainly found that to be
the<00:02:17.950> case<00:02:17.980> absolutely<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.300> think<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.660> as

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
the case absolutely and I think it's as

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.140 
the case absolutely and I think it's as
you're<00:02:19.990> watching<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.440> video<00:02:20.650> here<00:02:20.920> um<00:02:21.700> I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
you're watching the video here um I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.610 
you're watching the video here um I
think<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:22.930> important<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.260> point<00:02:23.470> out

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
think it's really important to point out

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.680 
think it's really important to point out
that<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.610> haven't<00:02:24.850> sacrificed<00:02:25.060> any<00:02:25.540> of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that we really haven't sacrificed any of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.900 
that we really haven't sacrificed any of
the<00:02:25.750> graphical<00:02:26.290> fidelity<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> game<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.520> to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
the graphical fidelity of the game to to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.120 
the graphical fidelity of the game to to
get<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.930> console<00:02:29.260> versions<00:02:29.590> done<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.920> still

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
