00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.400
 for suits presses people 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:22.289
 they take icy things I've trained 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 I delayed about a year when no 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.859
 be squared because I'm not marking 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.160
 but yes at least my muscles that are 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.160
 go 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.100
 your night life to stop to take out the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.890
 body that you have in 8 months is 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:46.040
 impossible because the answer the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:53.739
 we want but after the break plus the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.739
 situation all the big 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:14.840
 we are really this kind of person 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:21.290
 now because as a man I have like 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.460
 it seems man as man and how much 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.460

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:41.569
 as a former friend that I am yours obviously 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.569
 I said look at the face that has a hangover 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:09.590
 when a product called 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:23.810
 irina if you can not pronounce it if it is 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:28.260
 because if it 's an everyday topic and 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.870
 the name that is envious is the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.980
 alien progress 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.709
 I'm progressing like that I'm a person 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 that he was looking inside so that nothing 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.730

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.549
 any great canary truth I 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.140
 I qualify only for me and for 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.760
 person who sings to me putting together your 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.370
 back the trams 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.330
 Excuse me, but do your trios 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.330
 what are you going to build 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.660
 with a little bit of sanity remember that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.269
 equal or worse than being friends, nothing 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.280
 we go for there is one that bothers me and 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.290
 as your said ex friends obviously me 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 I know everything you're talking perlitas 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.440
 excuse me that I was there 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.590
 person four years younger than me only 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.660
 I wanted to keep you I kept saying irina 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 which keeps it at a time no longer take him 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.319
 already then you keep going with your 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.319
 manager of ronaldo and with that gringo 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:54.790
 at the same time he obviously has the gringo 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.790
 Romanian and consummate not exercised leaving 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.420
 obviously she by the schedule is that not 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.130
 I want if you try and do not pass the body 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 then you can insure things from 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.500
 genting like for example I do not know what to see 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.820
 what can you tell us to lose and not for 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:22.040
 the schedule I can not add three 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.200
 boyfriends at once forgiveness and I think he has 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.090
 been kind of a slap of water 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.460
 white flour and not that they want us 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.470
 to bring the subject here the subject is something very 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.360
 punctual and I think that all good we are not 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.250
 no fools and we know you do 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.560
 a lot of time and the body that you have 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.900
 right now is the body you have not had it and 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:45.310
 the people that is if we exercise 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:48.260
 as carla as I know eight months is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.210
 impossible in addition imposition all respect 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.400
 I'm telling you, irina, because of how old you are 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.960
 you have, it 's impossible that in eight months 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.650
 make 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.650
 totally 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:06.610
 in the diet you know why I have not 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.610
 achieved this because I dedicated myself to 100 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:15.650
 money because it is very expensive 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:19.759
 a diet is a fairly high cost 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:24.250
 three proteins but they have also approached 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.250
 the salaries 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.639
 is that they not only dedicate themselves to 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:38.630
 do artistic show cheering also 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:41.410
 businesswoman the family keep me but 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.410
 I live well 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.840
 I do not understand what the problem is 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.970
 in eight months he was training 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.850
 can spend what I have is 50 me 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.890
 I can afford to eat 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.790
 healthily you got what I want 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.790
 that thing 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.720
 here they say and I have put it down the street 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:34.470
 apart from that but look at his voice is the 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:36.450
 better that we are in summer and finally 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.440
 If there is a consumer, what is the 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.440
 Program 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.229
 because you do not say it in the end in your body 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.229
 is to look 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.440
 and the futurist 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.940
 Then he requested the consultation and said 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.790
 that your brain and your neurons are 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.940
 Failing for the things that you get and 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.850
 you want half rare medium or middle country 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.660
 no longer understand rare rare crazy or weird 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.660
 of what it is like 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:27.060
 but it's not suddenly clear to me 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.060
 you are having some kind of interest for 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.060
 women 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:47.760
 man i like men and jokes in 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.760
 serious 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.010
 let's say it comes from a family 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:02.080
 needed 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:05.650
 that's why I say number 2 98 98 40 27 7 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.020
