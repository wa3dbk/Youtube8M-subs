channels<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.590> people<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:28.859> finding<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
channels a lot of people are finding the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
channels a lot of people are finding the
mechanics<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.880> process<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> another

cable in it now one thing I'd like to
talk<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.780> before<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> process

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
talk about before we get on the process

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
talk about before we get on the process
of<00:00:43.980> hooking<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> cable<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.180> talking

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
of hooking up the cable I'm talking

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.590 
of hooking up the cable I'm talking
about<00:00:46.160> plugging<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.120> won't<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:48.420> hate

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
about plugging this into I won't my hate

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.590 
about plugging this into I won't my hate
the<00:00:49.050> closure<00:00:49.670> now<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.730> want<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> look<00:00:51.420> at

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the closure now I want you to look at

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.350 
the closure now I want you to look at
the<00:00:51.719> actual<00:00:51.809> cable<00:00:52.289> itself<00:00:52.879> if<00:00:53.879> you'll<00:00:54.090> notice

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the actual cable itself if you'll notice

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
the actual cable itself if you'll notice
on<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.570> cable<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.289> cables<00:00:55.680> look

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
on this cable not all cables look

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319 
on this cable not all cables look
exactly<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> same<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.699> terms<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.000> coloring

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
exactly the same in terms of coloring

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.020 
exactly the same in terms of coloring
but<00:00:58.230> my<00:00:58.379> cable<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> blue<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> white<00:00:59.489> backing

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
but my cable is a blue and white backing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
but my cable is a blue and white backing
I<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> picture<00:01:01.379> attention<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I want you to picture attention to this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
I want you to picture attention to this
for<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.460> reason<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.809> notice<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
for one reason if you notice the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.090 
for one reason if you notice the
thickness<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> cable<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:06.210> end<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> thinner

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
thickness on a cable one end is thinner

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
thickness on a cable one end is thinner
one<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> thicker<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> reason<00:01:09.900> that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
one in is thicker there's a reason that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
one in is thicker there's a reason that
the<00:01:10.860> actual<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.310> towards<00:01:11.549> yourself<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the actual in towards yourself to the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
the actual in towards yourself to the
bit<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:12.930> space<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> play<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.920> natural

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
bit more space to play with a natural

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
bit more space to play with a natural
safe<00:01:14.460> connection<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.470> make<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
safe connection so you have to make the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
safe connection so you have to make the
thick<00:01:17.009> part<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> cable<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
thick part of the cable into the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
thick part of the cable into the
enclosure<00:01:19.140> always<00:01:19.890> always<00:01:20.100> check<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
enclosure always always check which is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
enclosure always always check which is
the<00:01:21.119> thinnest<00:01:21.420> part<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.470> notice<00:01:22.830> on

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the thinnest part because we notice on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
the thinnest part because we notice on
the<00:01:23.159> actual<00:01:23.490> incitive<00:01:23.820> itself<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.380> very

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the actual incitive itself this is very

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
the actual incitive itself this is very
small<00:01:25.710> very<00:01:26.430> thin<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.390> trying<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
small very thin so if you're trying to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.929 
small very thin so if you're trying to
place<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.320> big<00:01:28.950> cable<00:01:29.369> into<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.909> going

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
place a big cable into it you're going

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.390 
place a big cable into it you're going
to<00:01:30.119> let<00:01:30.360> difficulty<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.950> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> always

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to let difficulty so I want to always

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670 
to let difficulty so I want to always
apply<00:01:32.579> another<00:01:32.939> fact<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> notice<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.619> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
apply another fact if you notice on this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.330 
apply another fact if you notice on this

connect as if cable to the safe product
now<00:03:50.769> same<00:03:51.070> tanks<00:03:51.549> again<00:03:51.840> with<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> actual

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
now same tanks again with the actual

now same tanks again with the actual
contact<00:03:53.590> connection<00:03:54.070> do<00:03:54.459> not<00:03:54.670> do<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.940> this<00:03:55.120> way

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
contact connection do not do it this way

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.850 
contact connection do not do it this way
it's<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.680> way<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:57.040> contact<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:58.600> contact<00:03:59.110> so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
it's this way it's contact to contact so

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.960 
it's this way it's contact to contact so
you<00:03:59.920> just<00:04:00.010> make<00:04:00.160> always<00:04:00.489> make<00:04:00.610> sure<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.760> the
