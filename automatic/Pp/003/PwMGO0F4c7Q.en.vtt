you<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.770> becomes<00:01:30.890> pretty<00:01:31.310> intense<00:01:31.729> when

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
you it becomes pretty intense when

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.300 
you it becomes pretty intense when

bankers so the other portion of the demo
focused<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.960> invisible<00:01:39.350> predator<00:01:39.710> mode

going to hurt a bit and you know he's

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.810 
going to hurt a bit and you know he's
got<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.180> try<00:02:05.390> for<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:05.840> not<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.110> happen<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:07.610> we

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
got to try for that not to happen so we

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.580 
got to try for that not to happen so we
really<00:02:08.060> focused<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.540> idea<00:02:08.570> of<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.470> know

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
really focused on the idea of you know

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.060 
really focused on the idea of you know
Batman<00:02:10.250> being<00:02:11.410> all<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.590> bad<00:02:12.709> guys<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.010> the

Batman being all the bad guys in the
room<00:02:13.130> being<00:02:13.310> scared<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.850> Batman<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.329> like<00:02:15.260> we

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
room being scared of Batman and like we

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.949 
room being scared of Batman and like we
showed<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.040> know<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.190> move<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:16.700> a

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
showed you you know you move up to a

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.289 
showed you you know you move up to a
gargle<00:02:17.959> user<00:02:18.380> as<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.620> vantage<00:02:18.799> point<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:20.120> want

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
gargle user as a vantage point we want

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.300 
gargle user as a vantage point we want
you<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.480> feel<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.720> you're<00:02:21.079> surveying<00:02:22.070> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
you to feel like you're surveying the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.890 
you to feel like you're surveying the
room<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.700> know<00:02:22.790> really<00:02:23.030> picking<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.750> weak

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
room you know really picking on the weak

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.350 
room you know really picking on the weak
targets<00:02:24.530> now<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:25.430> really<00:02:26.030> making

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
targets now and then really making

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
targets now and then really making
everyone<00:02:26.690> I'm<00:02:27.019> more<00:02:27.230> unnerved<00:02:27.739> as<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.190> play

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
everyone I'm more unnerved as you play

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.809 
everyone I'm more unnerved as you play
so<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.120> isolate<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.600> target<00:02:30.049> may<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.290> doing

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
so you isolate your target may be doing

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.119 
so you isolate your target may be doing
to<00:02:30.999> take<00:02:31.239> down<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.780> gargoyle<00:02:32.260> drag<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:32.980> guy

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
to take down the gargoyle drag the guy

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.649 
to take down the gargoyle drag the guy
up<00:02:33.340> into<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.609> rafters<00:02:33.760> leave<00:02:34.359> him<00:02:34.510> hanging

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
up into the rafters leave him hanging

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.690 
up into the rafters leave him hanging
there<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.409> kind<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.709> affects<00:02:35.859> the<00:02:36.249> morale<00:02:36.400> of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
there it kind of affects the morale of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.399 
there it kind of affects the morale of
the<00:02:36.939> other<00:02:37.060> guys<00:02:37.299> in<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.569> room<00:02:37.719> and<00:02:38.230> they

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
the other guys in the room and they

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.690 
the other guys in the room and they
start<00:02:38.680> looking<00:02:39.010> people<00:02:39.249> they<00:02:39.310> know<00:02:39.519> you're

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
start looking people they know you're

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.089 
start looking people they know you're
there<00:02:39.730> at<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.120> point<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:40.719> then<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.829> kind<00:02:42.040> of

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
there at this point so then it kind of

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.399 
there at this point so then it kind of
escalates<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.969> complexity<00:02:43.840> because<00:02:44.260> you're

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
escalates in complexity because you're

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.959 
escalates in complexity because you're
trying<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.739> take<00:02:44.889> people<00:02:45.040> out<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:45.579> you're

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
trying to take people out but you're

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.789 
trying to take people out but you're
really<00:02:46.150> studying<00:02:46.629> what<00:02:46.930> they're<00:02:47.170> kind<00:02:47.739> of

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
really studying what they're kind of

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.949 
really studying what they're kind of
doing<00:02:48.219> in<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> room<00:02:48.639> now<00:02:49.329> we<00:02:49.480> really<00:02:49.659> want<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
doing in the room now we really want you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.220 
doing in the room now we really want you
to<00:02:50.019> think<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:50.950> Batman<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:56.109> other

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
to think like Batman now the the other

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.629 
to think like Batman now the the other
mode<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.739> got<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.099> see<00:02:57.280> was<00:02:57.489> the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
mode that we got to see was the

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.030 
mode that we got to see was the
detective<00:02:57.909> mode<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.590> while<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.620> seemed

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
detective mode and while that seemed

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.500 
detective mode and while that seemed
pretty<00:03:00.249> straightforward<00:03:00.999> I<00:03:01.120> would<00:03:01.269> imagine

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
pretty straightforward I would imagine

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.729 
pretty straightforward I would imagine
that<00:03:01.780> they're<00:03:02.019> going<00:03:02.169> to<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.349> some<00:03:02.560> fairly

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
that they're going to be some fairly

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.800 
that they're going to be some fairly
complicated<00:03:03.159> uses<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:03.939> it<00:03:04.060> as<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.419> go<00:03:04.450> into

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
complicated uses for it as you go into

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.170 
complicated uses for it as you go into
the<00:03:04.989> game<00:03:05.169> the<00:03:05.919> tape<00:03:06.099> remote<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.459> also<00:03:06.730> as<00:03:07.000> we

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
the game the tape remote is also as we

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.149 
the game the tape remote is also as we
showed<00:03:07.389> you<00:03:07.569> got<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> x-ray<00:03:08.230> mode<00:03:08.409> as<00:03:08.650> part<00:03:09.069> of

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
showed you got the x-ray mode as part of

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.800 
showed you got the x-ray mode as part of
it<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.969> you<00:03:10.000> use<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.659> determine<00:03:11.199> a<00:03:12.180> wear<00:03:13.180> pjs

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
it so you use it to determine a wear pjs

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.470 
it so you use it to determine a wear pjs
are<00:03:14.049> what<00:03:14.620> kind<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.859> bad<00:03:15.040> guys<00:03:15.250> they<00:03:15.459> are<00:03:15.669> their

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
are what kind of bad guys they are their

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.879 
are what kind of bad guys they are their
mental<00:03:16.840> states<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.409> can<00:03:17.590> check<00:03:17.739> their

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
mental states you can check their

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.709 
mental states you can check their
hobbies<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.669> see<00:03:18.849> if<00:03:18.909> they're<00:03:19.060> nervous<00:03:19.269> or

scared if they're going to make mistakes

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.640 
scared if they're going to make mistakes

that kind of thing the final part of the
demo<00:03:23.829> showed<00:03:24.189> off<00:03:24.370> something<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.389> refer
