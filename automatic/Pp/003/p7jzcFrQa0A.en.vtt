we're a bit worried but the thing with

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.780 
we're a bit worried but the thing with
our<00:00:46.200> MP<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.920> always<00:00:47.130> have<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.490> last

through<00:00:48.330> the<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.750> say<00:00:49.280> 30-40<00:00:50.280> seconds<00:00:50.580> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
through the first say 30-40 seconds of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.830 
through the first say 30-40 seconds of
the<00:00:50.760> game<00:00:50.790> where<00:00:51.180> they're<00:00:51.330> blowing<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.690> their

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the game where they're blowing all their

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660 
the game where they're blowing all their
cooldowns<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.740> if<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.950> can<00:00:53.100> survive<00:00:53.250> through

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
cooldowns and if you can survive through

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.100 
cooldowns and if you can survive through
that<00:00:53.880> then<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.630> good<00:00:54.780> chance<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
that then you have a good chance of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.370 
that then you have a good chance of
winning<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.470> game<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.360> far<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:58.140> teams

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
winning the game but so far the teams

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.720 
winning the game but so far the teams
that<00:00:58.440> we've<00:00:58.650> played<00:00:58.920> I've<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.250> put<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.610> much

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that we've played I've just put so much

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.550 
that we've played I've just put so much
pressure<00:00:59.790> on<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.660> start<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.290> really

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
pressure on at the start that we really

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.870 
pressure on at the start that we really
haven't<00:01:01.800> been<00:01:01.890> able<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.340> through<00:01:02.400> the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
haven't been able to get through the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.410 
haven't been able to get through the
opening<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> game<00:01:04.259> but<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:06.060> they

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
opening bit of the game but I think they

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.200 
opening bit of the game but I think they
will<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> better<00:01:07.590> against<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.730> team<00:01:08.970> if

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
will do a better against this team if

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.550 
will do a better against this team if
they're<00:01:09.360> running<00:01:09.510> our<00:01:09.750> cane<00:01:09.990> instead<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
they're running our cane instead of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.630 
they're running our cane instead of
frost<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.310> we'll<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.250> agents

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
frost so we'll see you think the agents

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
frost so we'll see you think the agents
are<00:01:14.730> coming<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.480> arcane<00:01:15.930> mages<00:01:16.200> rather

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
are coming here with arcane mages rather

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
are coming here with arcane mages rather
than<00:01:16.800> frost<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
than frost or do you know that for a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.790 
than frost or do you know that for a
fact<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.810> that's<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.290> saw<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:19.620> running

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
fact well that's all we saw them running

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000

earlier<00:01:20.270> okay<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:22.229> disappointing<00:01:22.800> losses

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
earlier okay so two disappointing losses

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.010 
earlier okay so two disappointing losses

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
playing good so far really because I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.809 
playing good so far really because I
mean<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.900> good<00:02:07.170> feeling<00:02:07.470> about<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.519> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
mean it's a good feeling about like this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.509 
mean it's a good feeling about like this
game<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.470> team<00:02:10.860> EG<00:02:11.159> are<00:02:11.280> playing

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
game and just how team EG are playing

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.770 
game and just how team EG are playing
because<00:02:11.700> obviously<00:02:12.030> you've<00:02:12.299> flown<00:02:12.450> over<00:02:12.510> from

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
because obviously you've flown over from

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.030 
because obviously you've flown over from
America<00:02:12.959> sometimes<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.800> could<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
America sometimes that could be a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.980 
America sometimes that could be a
disadvantage

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
disadvantage

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.470 
disadvantage
x<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.710> know<00:02:15.830> people<00:02:16.040> strive<00:02:16.880> in<00:02:16.910> front<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.360> an

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
x you know people strive in front of an

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.760 
x you know people strive in front of an
audience<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:18.020> you've<00:02:18.140> had<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.440> your<00:02:18.560> games

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
audience and you've had all your games

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.100 
audience and you've had all your games
so<00:02:19.100> far<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.340> group<00:02:19.640> stages<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.360> i<00:02:20.600> knows<00:02:20.840> is

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
so far in group stages and i knows is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.020 
so far in group stages and i knows is
likes<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.560> get<00:02:21.740> up<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.070> jump<00:02:22.220> around<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.820> show

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
likes to get up and jump around and show

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.520 
likes to get up and jump around and show
off<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.690> mean<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.170> think<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
off so i mean do you think that the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.930 
off so i mean do you think that the
stage<00:02:24.800> might<00:02:25.100> give<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.370> bit<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.550> advantage

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
stage might give you a bit of advantage

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.490 
stage might give you a bit of advantage
i<00:02:26.800> guess<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:27.830> i<00:02:28.040> mean<00:02:28.400> i<00:02:28.970> think<00:02:29.570> whoever<00:02:30.170> gets

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
i guess so i mean i think whoever gets

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.590 
i guess so i mean i think whoever gets
off<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> good<00:02:31.520> start<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:32.090> gonna<00:02:32.330> have<00:02:32.480> the

off to a good start is gonna have the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.120 
off to a good start is gonna have the
advantage<00:02:33.020> get<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> crowd<00:02:33.590> behind<00:02:33.860> them<00:02:33.980> a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130
