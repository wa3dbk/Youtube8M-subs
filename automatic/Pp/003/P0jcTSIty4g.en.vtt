look at the sheep and had a look at the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
look at the sheep and had a look at the
grass<00:00:39.329> part<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> problem<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> we

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
grass part of the problem was that we

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.639 
grass part of the problem was that we
put<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> clover<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.600> our<00:00:42.719> swartz<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
put a lot of clover in our swartz the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.170 
put a lot of clover in our swartz the
lambs<00:00:43.829> weren't<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.430> processing<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
lambs weren't really processing the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
lambs weren't really processing the
grass<00:00:45.480> properly<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.100> wet<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> very

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
grass properly it was very wet and very

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
grass properly it was very wet and very
lush<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.360> basically<00:00:48.809> gone<00:00:49.050> straight<00:00:49.320> through

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
lush and basically gone straight through

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.220 
lush and basically gone straight through
them<00:00:49.739> did<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.399> any<00:00:50.579> mortalities<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
them did you have any mortalities not to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.619 
them did you have any mortalities not to
that<00:00:52.350> point<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.629> increasingly

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that point but it was increasingly

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
that point but it was increasingly
looking<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.559> were<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
looking like as if we were going to I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
looking like as if we were going to I
thought<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.879> least<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.420> third<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.020> our<00:00:58.140> lambs

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
thought at least a third of our lambs

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.889 
thought at least a third of our lambs
were<00:00:58.710> almost<00:00:59.160> looking<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.510> might<00:01:00.690> die

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
were almost looking as if they might die

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
were almost looking as if they might die
so<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> point<00:01:02.129> iment<00:01:02.579> met<00:01:02.820> Alan<00:01:03.180> Davies

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so at that point iment met Alan Davies

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.350 
so at that point iment met Alan Davies
from<00:01:03.809> Animax<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.830> did<00:01:04.979> he<00:01:05.100> suggest<00:01:05.360> he

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
suggested a bolus combination of cobalt

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
suggested a bolus combination of cobalt
selenium<00:01:09.960> iodine<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> copper<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.490> must<00:01:11.850> say

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and the copper obviously it's made us

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.930 
and the copper obviously it's made us
very<00:02:15.900> aware<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.530> how<00:02:17.010> important<00:02:17.520> these<00:02:17.670> trace

elements<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.810> definitely<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.590> the

we've gone back to outdoor lambing and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.650 
we've gone back to outdoor lambing and
that's<00:02:28.890> quite<00:02:29.160> vital<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.820> tell<00:02:30.420> me<00:02:30.570> about

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
your system here the Sheep are very

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.480 
your system here the Sheep are very
extensive<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:33.840> try<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.440> pump<00:02:35.100> too<00:02:35.310> much

money into the sheep system if we can't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380 
money into the sheep system if we can't
gonna<00:02:37.650> try<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.010> do<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.250> all<00:02:38.370> off<00:02:38.520> grass<00:02:38.850> we

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
gonna try and do it all off grass we

don't feed to use any concentrates in

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.580 
don't feed to use any concentrates in
the<00:02:41.700> winter<00:02:41.970> time<00:02:42.120> they're<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:43.140> silage

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the winter time they're just on silage

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.170 
the winter time they're just on silage
when<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.040> need<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.000> whole

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
when they need it and this is the whole

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
when they need it and this is the whole
idea<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.660> going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.050> New<00:02:46.080> Zealand<00:02:46.260> Romney<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
idea of going to New Zealand Romney I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.560 
idea of going to New Zealand Romney I
think<00:02:47.310> they're<00:02:47.610> about<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.090> only<00:02:48.239> type<00:02:48.540> of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
think they're about the only type of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.960 
think they're about the only type of
sheep<00:02:48.870> that's<00:02:49.080> gonna<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.590> able<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.890> stick<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
sheep that's gonna be able to stick that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420 
sheep that's gonna be able to stick that
kind<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.300> system<00:02:51.690> we've<00:02:52.530> tried<00:02:52.739> these<00:02:52.920> bonuses

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
kind of system we've tried these bonuses

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.420 
kind of system we've tried these bonuses
in<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.640> cows<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.300> think<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.530> helped<00:02:56.280> our

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
in the cows I think that it's helped our

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430 
in the cows I think that it's helped our
cows<00:02:56.700> even<00:02:57.300> more<00:02:57.480> than<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.720> Sheep<00:02:57.930> possibly

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
cows even more than the Sheep possibly

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.890 
cows even more than the Sheep possibly
and<00:02:58.830> what<00:02:59.220> benefits<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.090> noticed<00:03:00.600> in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
and what benefits have you noticed in

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.630 
and what benefits have you noticed in
the<00:03:01.050> beef<00:03:01.230> herd<00:03:01.470> since<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.010> started<00:03:02.400> using

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
the beef herd since you started using

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.750 
the beef herd since you started using
trace<00:03:03.120> your<00:03:03.330> cui<00:03:04.010> definitely<00:03:05.010> better<00:03:05.459> milk

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
trace your cui definitely better milk

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.180 
trace your cui definitely better milk
supply<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.780> noticeable<00:03:07.019> oh<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.980> cows

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
supply it's very noticeable oh the cows

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.520 
supply it's very noticeable oh the cows
doing<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.820> year<00:03:09.090> compared<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> others<00:03:10.110> so

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
doing this year compared to others so

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.900 
doing this year compared to others so
obviously<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> cows<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.550> got<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.820> be

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
obviously the cows have got to be

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.850 
obviously the cows have got to be
milking<00:03:12.239> better<00:03:12.450> we've<00:03:12.900> had<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.350> easiest

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
milking better we've had the easiest

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.830 
milking better we've had the easiest
calves<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.760> spring<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
calves in this spring with the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.360 
calves in this spring with the
combination<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> Belgian<00:03:16.980> blue<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
combination of the Belgian blue and the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.130 
combination of the Belgian blue and the
Charlie<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:17.910> not<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> best<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.780> think

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
Charlie it's not the best but I think

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.740 
Charlie it's not the best but I think
that<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.890> cows<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.459> carved<00:03:20.910> more<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.510> time

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that the cows have carved more to time
