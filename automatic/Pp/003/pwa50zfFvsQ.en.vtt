myself a nice protein treatment and the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.680 
myself a nice protein treatment and the
reason<00:01:52.570> why<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:53.170> sectioned<00:01:54.130> off<00:01:54.340> into<00:01:54.690> four

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
reason why I sectioned off into four

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.870 
reason why I sectioned off into four
sections<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.770> will<00:01:56.800> edit<00:01:57.190> some<00:01:57.520> miss<00:01:57.700> out

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
sections and I will edit some miss out

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.970 
sections and I will edit some miss out
so<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.210> won't<00:01:58.420> hate<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.780> bear<00:01:58.960> through<00:01:59.740> all

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
so you won't hate the bear through all

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:09.840 
so you won't hate the bear through all
of<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> reason<00:02:02.020> why<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:08.730> section<00:02:09.730> it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
of it and the reason why I section it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.840 
of it and the reason why I section it
off<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.840> every<00:02:12.540> part<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.630> my<00:02:13.810> hair

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
off is so that every part of my hair

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:26.540 
off is so that every part of my hair
will<00:02:15.850> get<00:02:16.290> some<00:02:17.290> product<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:23.740> 20<00:02:24.100> minutes

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:38.400 

and<00:02:27.550> then<00:02:27.970> I'll<00:02:28.150> rinse<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.110> another

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
and then I'll rinse it this is another

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:48.890 
and then I'll rinse it this is another
thing<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.310> learned<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.970> fun<00:02:40.239> out<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:46.890> of
