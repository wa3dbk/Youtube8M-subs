00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 start with today's video and how 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.869
 you can remember yesterday I had them 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 said that ign was going to say today very 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.279
 important about big cars and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 all these things then we have already 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 said several things and they have already taken us 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 a gameplay then in the description 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 of this video I'm going to leave you the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 hygiene article so that you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 You can check it with your own eyes and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.790
 that there they will be able to find a gameplay of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 everything I'm talking about and that's it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 confirmed the first person in large 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 cars and is not a first person in the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.469
 which will only be in the mode 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.690
 driver like we have today 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.850
 but that all the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.320
 time and if you know what I mean 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 with all the time since we can 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 use all the time here as what 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.550
 can see they will be seeing an image in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.739
 which the character of great fauto 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.390
 he's just using his cell phone but 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.520
 as you can appreciate we can 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.400
 see through what your doing 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.060
 hand we can see the phone in his palm 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.189
 hand in hand 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's something that 's amazing because here 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.500
 it's a new game mode and were 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 completely totally remastering 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 this is a true remastering 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 because as you can see for also 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 load a weapon or just shoot 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.509
 we are going to use also these little things 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.460
 to point as if it were the first 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.470
 shooting person not that the truth is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 something that is super good and I see that it is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.130
 something that is a new modality the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.750
 I really do not know why rockstar has 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.579
 decided to do this I do not know if they want 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.020
 refresh the company a bit because 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.880
 as you will know rockstargames will 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 characterized by being a game in third 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.140
 person since the whole saga has been 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.539
 always as well as you can see this is going to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.459
 apply absolutely everything and look here 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.590
 as we see the accelerometer that the truth 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.569
 it's something that is awesome while 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.520
 that at the same time we got to see a 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.780
 cost edge of the helmet and I think that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.149
 it's something well not as you will know 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.649
 we currently have a bit of first 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.509
 person in our big car and if you 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.280
 they ask how is the first person in 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.720
 the great defect as many will be remembered 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
 the club point since in the puticlub 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.519
 we had a first person since 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.190
 we saw from the perspective of our 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.690
 character but nowadays it's going to be 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.820
 something totally 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.980
 as much as for the mirage of weapons 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.770
 and for many more things and how 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.240
 see this is something that the truth is 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.130
 truly amazing and if you guys 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.780
