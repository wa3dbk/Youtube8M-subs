that<00:02:32.130> was<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> tablespoon<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.450> using

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
that was a tablespoon that I was using

didn't add a full tablespoon of was the
castor<00:02:38.010> oil<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.760> kind<00:02:39.420> of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
castor oil because it's kind of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.090 
castor oil because it's kind of
expensive<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.380> really<00:02:40.590> doesn't<00:02:40.830> take<00:02:41.070> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
lot of that to use so I only use maybe a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.770 
lot of that to use so I only use maybe a
