CLG has been losing quite badly to TSM
in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:12.990> past<00:00:13.200> while<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:14.719> it'd<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.960> good

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
in the past while so it'd be a good

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.270 
in the past while so it'd be a good
breath<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.710> fresh<00:00:16.890> air<00:00:17.130> insisting<00:00:17.970> CLG<00:00:18.449> win

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.370 

so<00:00:21.790> when<00:00:22.150> there's<00:00:22.360> mini<00:00:22.630> gnar<00:00:22.840> and<00:00:22.870> really

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
so when there's mini gnar and really

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.109
