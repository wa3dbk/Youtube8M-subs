00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.479
 I need to make the sale 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.359
 this business theme area 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.919
 the notarial subject 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.970
 I need to make the sale 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.970
 but that the writing is done with all value 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.739
 advisable to make two promises of different sales 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.330
 I want to do so as not to have problems when writing and receiving the 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.880
 real value 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.260
 who pays the value of the withholding 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 the seller was the buyer 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.280
 look practice is very common 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 that we bought a property for 100 million pesos 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.460
 but we ended up making public deeds 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.490
 for 70 million pesos 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.470
 It seems 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.530
 the public deeds in colombia the notary 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.699
 they demand 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.900
 that the minimum sale value 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.310
 it has to be the same 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.239
 the users 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.550
 but it can not be inferior 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.250
 at least it must be the same value 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.050
 of the cadastral appraisal 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.079
 that the municipal public entity has finished ana s 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.590
 the quality municipality of that district turned that day 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.060
 have to cover house 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 my house is commercially worth 100 million pesos 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.560
 and I will sell it over 100 million pesos guash tamas 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.730
 before the municipality of Cali the cadastral appraisal is in 70 million pesos 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.480
 and the standard established 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.790
 that no sale of real estate 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.350
 it may be below 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.530
 from the ONU 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.700
 each zone 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 that's why he says 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.490
 and to reduce notary costs 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.090
 because it is that the notary 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.650
 when two with the public deed 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.650
 will charge us on the value of the business 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.850
 it is not the same to do the public deed of sale of 100 million 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.310
 make a sale of 70 million pesos 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.460
 the costs of public deed are different 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.569
 the highest value of art notary fees 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.359
 of a 100 million scholarship 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.349
 to a sale of 70 million 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.369
 because he himself is not going to charge p then 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.039
 the naan a notary 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.459
 It will also be the tax issue 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.189
 about those attacks on his temples 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.090
 3 as the standard applies 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.730
 that we can do it over the minimum value without it being less than balah 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.829
 cadastral appraisal because we will always do those sales 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.309
 about the cadastral appraisals 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.649
 to reduce costs likewise 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.719
 once the premieres among the public deed 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.839
 It is mandatory to register public deed before the office of 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.320
 public instruments 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320
 make the respective payment of the fiscal ballot 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.999
 from the Department 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.350
 my daughter owed due payment 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.549
 of the public deed registration before the public instruments office 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.339
 also that these two additional values 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:01.759
 that the fiscal ballot 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:02.570
 and the 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.529
 the due registration of the bis public torments 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.759
 they will also charge it on the value of the sale 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.059
 that's why 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.059
 look that there are three factors that will not charge only the value of the sale 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.709
 the notarial expenses the fiscal ballot 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.739
 the record of what other audiences add 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.889
 as then values 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.569
 they are the organs of writing but then that is why they are always made 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.859
 the sales 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.590
 about the value 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.010
 no that hadi reported 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.820
 in the cadastral appraisal 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.609
 not just the actual sale 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:35.699
 now 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.539
 let's go then, "he added," it's the same 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:42.199
 when they are going to pay me I am charging the 100 million pesos that 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.839
 is the commercial appraisal of the property 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.209
 then we go to a sale 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.949
 a promise of sale 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.499
 but we're not going to make two promises 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.849
 a promise over 100 and another promise over 70 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.370
 it is simply a promise of purchase 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 in which I now commit myself in moral terms over 100 million 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.759
 pesos 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.239
 commercial value as 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.450
 and the buyer 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.569
 is committing to pay me 100 million pesos 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.620
 commercial value is fine 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.519
 and simply the bottom part of the same promise of sale 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.779
 we are going to kill 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.939
 because of costs or because of costs 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.360
 writing 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.170
 public 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.220
 will be done on the value of the cadastral appraisal 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.920
 irma buyer's committee 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.930
 and firm that provides content 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.860
 it is said that it is only a promise of sale 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.410
 where are we saying 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.020
 that I am not selling on the commercial value if they are going to pay me value 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.790
 commercial 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.289
 but the battle 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.999
 public deeds notary beds we are going to do about the 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.779
 appraise 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.439
 caracas fringe 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.159
 at the same moment we are leaving reflected in that 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.080
 when we arrived they would not notice we already know what we are going to do 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.370
 let's inform them that you valued it 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.150
 of the cadastral appraisal to reduce costs 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.349
 notarial 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.349
 to record distance tickets 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.770
 on the issue of detention 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.639
 who is punk and instead of July to pay attention to the seller 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.449
 like all business 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.639
 perfectly the promise of sale can be agreed 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.240
 it can be agreed that the retention 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.770
 that will collect albatalÃ­a 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.180
 the pay the seller will play for the buyer 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.610
 50% possibilities 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.020
 but as a rule 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.020
 it happens that the general who must pay the withholding 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.690
 is that the seller
