unfortunately<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:30.330> just<00:05:30.630> leaving<00:05:30.930> with<00:05:31.050> a

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
unfortunately it's just leaving with a

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.060 
unfortunately it's just leaving with a
web<00:05:31.289> browser<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.919> the<00:05:32.400> music<00:05:33.120> player<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:34.229> not

web browser and the music player so not

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.879 
web browser and the music player so not
the<00:05:35.250> bet<00:05:35.550> not<00:05:35.810> it<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.380> doesn't<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.610> is<00:05:38.789> good

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
the bet not it is it doesn't it is good

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.800 
the bet not it is it doesn't it is good
but<00:05:40.889> it's<00:05:41.039> not<00:05:41.070> intuitive<00:05:41.430> i<00:05:41.910> can't<00:05:42.360> tell

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
but it's not intuitive i can't tell

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.870 
but it's not intuitive i can't tell

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
me being a grumpy old sensor I often

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.510 
me being a grumpy old sensor I often
like<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.479> choose<00:05:48.810> exactly<00:05:49.229> what<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.710> want<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.460> to

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
like to choose exactly what I want it to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.120 
like to choose exactly what I want it to
do<00:05:50.789> and<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.060> won't<00:05:51.210> let<00:05:51.330> me<00:05:51.419> do<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.599> so<00:05:52.349> the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
do and it won't let me do it so the

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.379 
do and it won't let me do it so the
widget<00:05:53.430> does<00:05:53.550> have<00:05:53.699> its<00:05:53.849> good<00:05:53.970> points<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.300> bad

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
widget does have its good points and bad

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.110 
widget does have its good points and bad
points<00:05:54.510> obviously<00:05:55.409> I<00:05:55.440> don't<00:05:55.919> use<00:05:56.159> it<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:59.120> simply

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
points obviously I don't use it I simply

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.790 
points obviously I don't use it I simply
not<00:06:00.630> both<00:06:00.810> sides<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.169> use<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.440> because<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.710> just

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
not both sides to use it because it just

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.170 
not both sides to use it because it just
takes<00:06:02.010> a<00:06:02.130> too<00:06:02.280> much<00:06:02.400> real<00:06:02.580> estate<00:06:02.699> was<00:06:03.030> too

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
takes a too much real estate was too

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.689 
takes a too much real estate was too
much<00:06:03.300> space<00:06:03.510> being<00:06:03.750> taken<00:06:04.020> up<00:06:04.080> by<00:06:04.139> this<00:06:04.710> item

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
much space being taken up by this item

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.879 
much space being taken up by this item
so<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.780> is<00:06:06.960> something<00:06:07.139> that<00:06:07.320> does<00:06:07.500> come<00:06:07.710> with<00:06:07.830> a

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889
