that's<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.140> most<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.500> want<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> work<00:01:10.830> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that's the most we want to work so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
that's the most we want to work so
you're<00:01:11.070> gonna<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.540> tilt

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
posterior pelvic tilt is going to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.960 
posterior pelvic tilt is going to
increase<00:03:04.829> tension<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.549> back<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.879> this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970

count want to come in here keep yourself
tall<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.120> go<00:04:24.630> right<00:04:24.840> into<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.139> stretch

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
tall and go right into the stretch

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.550 
tall and go right into the stretch
on<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.550> tenth<00:04:26.850> one<00:04:27.180> hold<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.960> position<00:04:28.140> and

on the tenth one hold that position and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.320 
on the tenth one hold that position and
then<00:04:28.980> we're<00:04:29.070> going<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.280> do<00:04:29.340> our<00:04:29.370> anterior<00:04:30.210> and

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
then we're going to do our anterior and

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.150 
then we're going to do our anterior and
posterior<00:04:30.450> pelvic<00:04:30.930> tilt<00:04:31.350> ten<00:04:31.590> times<00:04:31.830> again

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
posterior pelvic tilt ten times again

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.250 
posterior pelvic tilt ten times again
driven<00:04:32.850> through<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> hips<00:04:33.570> driven<00:04:34.110> through

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
driven through the hips driven through

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.200 
driven through the hips driven through
the<00:04:34.380> pelvis<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.010> then<00:04:35.670> we're<00:04:35.850> going<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.030> try

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
the pelvis and then we're going to try

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.510 
the pelvis and then we're going to try
to<00:04:36.240> rotate<00:04:36.510> now<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.020> rotation<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.070> really

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
to rotate now this rotation you really

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.190 
to rotate now this rotation you really
be<00:04:38.640> stiff<00:04:38.970> as<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.240> try<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.480> rotate<00:04:39.720> through

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
be stiff as you try to rotate through

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.540 
be stiff as you try to rotate through
and<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.380> cheat<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.800> going<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.010> be<00:04:41.160> winding

knee<00:06:20.580> is<00:06:20.910> going<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.150> be<00:06:21.240> in<00:06:21.300> a<00:06:21.390> straight

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
knee is going to be in a straight

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.950 
knee is going to be in a straight
position<00:06:21.720> to<00:06:22.200> start<00:06:22.410> out<00:06:22.620> with<00:06:23.300> once<00:06:24.300> I'm<00:06:24.510> here

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
position to start out with once I'm here

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.150 
position to start out with once I'm here
the<00:06:25.350> 3d<00:06:25.919> component<00:06:26.370> is<00:06:26.970> to<00:06:27.570> replicate

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
the 3d component is to replicate

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.130 
the 3d component is to replicate
supination<00:06:29.160> and<00:06:29.460> pronation<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:30.270> we<00:06:30.750> do<00:06:30.960> that

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
supination and pronation and we do that

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.750 
supination and pronation and we do that
by<00:06:31.350> driving<00:06:31.890> the<00:06:32.070> motion<00:06:32.490> through<00:06:32.669> this

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
by driving the motion through this

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.630 
by driving the motion through this
opposite<00:06:33.240> leg<00:06:33.450> so<00:06:34.229> when<00:06:34.440> I'm<00:06:34.650> driving<00:06:34.979> my<00:06:35.370> leg

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
opposite leg so when I'm driving my leg

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.480 
opposite leg so when I'm driving my leg
to<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.570> left<00:06:36.840> the<00:06:37.530> left<00:06:37.560> leg<00:06:37.950> to<00:06:38.010> the<00:06:38.190> left

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
to the left the left leg to the left

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.100 
to the left the left leg to the left
that<00:06:39.360> creates

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
that creates

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.150 
that creates
a<00:06:40.230> moment<00:06:41.180> down<00:06:42.180> in<00:06:42.450> my<00:06:42.600> foot<00:06:43.020> that<00:06:43.800> creates

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
a moment down in my foot that creates

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.400 
a moment down in my foot that creates
pronation<00:06:44.760> you'll<00:06:45.060> see<00:06:45.240> my<00:06:45.390> foot<00:06:45.660> go<00:06:45.900> inward

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
pronation you'll see my foot go inward

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:55.970 
pronation you'll see my foot go inward
or<00:06:46.590> pronate<00:06:47.600> here's<00:06:48.600> the<00:06:48.780> action<00:06:54.980> that's

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
or pronate here's the action that's

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.160 
or pronate here's the action that's
important<00:06:56.700> in<00:06:56.790> warming<00:06:57.240> up<00:06:57.390> that<00:06:57.600> calf<00:06:57.870> for

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
important in warming up that calf for

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.530 
important in warming up that calf for
pronation<00:06:58.590> now<00:06:59.370> the<00:06:59.430> other<00:06:59.700> motion<00:07:00.300> that<00:07:00.420> the

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
pronation now the other motion that the

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.380 
pronation now the other motion that the
foot<00:07:00.780> does<00:07:00.990> is<00:07:01.290> supination<00:07:02.250> it<00:07:02.610> goes<00:07:02.790> out<00:07:03.030> to

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
foot does is supination it goes out to

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.680 
foot does is supination it goes out to
the<00:07:03.510> side<00:07:03.950> so<00:07:04.950> to<00:07:05.250> drive<00:07:05.700> that<00:07:06.030> will<00:07:06.270> take<00:07:06.540> the

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
the side so to drive that will take the

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.230 
the side so to drive that will take the
leg<00:07:06.900> and<00:07:07.140> will<00:07:07.500> dry<00:07:07.770> the<00:07:07.800> knee<00:07:08.100> up<00:07:08.310> and<00:07:08.580> across

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
leg and will dry the knee up and across

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.310 
leg and will dry the knee up and across
the<00:07:09.360> body<00:07:09.750> and<00:07:10.080> that<00:07:11.070> creates<00:07:11.990> supination<00:07:12.990> as

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
the body and that creates supination as

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:20.930 
the body and that creates supination as
the<00:07:14.130> foot<00:07:14.400> is<00:07:14.690> rolling<00:07:15.690> outward<00:07:19.670> now<00:07:20.670> we<00:07:20.730> will

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
the foot is rolling outward now we will

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.940 
the foot is rolling outward now we will
do<00:07:21.150> both<00:07:21.360> of<00:07:21.420> those<00:07:21.840> with<00:07:22.470> the<00:07:22.620> knee<00:07:22.740> in<00:07:22.860> the

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
do both of those with the knee in the

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.040 
do both of those with the knee in the
straight<00:07:23.280> position<00:07:23.490> doing<00:07:24.330> about<00:07:24.570> 20

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.050 
straight position doing about 20

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.740 
straight position doing about 20
repetitions<00:07:25.260> of<00:07:25.830> each<00:07:26.130> kick<00:07:26.520> across<00:07:27.300> for

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
repetitions of each kick across for

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.650 
repetitions of each kick across for
pronation<00:07:28.170> and<00:07:28.500> a<00:07:29.250> cross<00:07:29.520> for<00:07:29.820> supination<00:07:30.360> and

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
pronation and a cross for supination and

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.930 
pronation and a cross for supination and
then<00:07:31.440> we'll<00:07:31.620> do<00:07:31.770> those<00:07:31.950> same<00:07:32.280> two<00:07:32.550> stretches

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
then we'll do those same two stretches

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.180 
then we'll do those same two stretches
with<00:07:33.600> the<00:07:33.720> need<00:07:33.900> a<00:07:33.930> slightly<00:07:34.500> bent<00:07:34.950> position

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
with the need a slightly bent position

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.340 
with the need a slightly bent position
so<00:07:36.000> I'm<00:07:36.090> going<00:07:36.240> to<00:07:36.270> get<00:07:36.420> a<00:07:36.450> little<00:07:36.810> bit<00:07:36.930> deeper

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350 
so I'm going to get a little bit deeper

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.050 
so I'm going to get a little bit deeper
stretch<00:07:37.680> down<00:07:38.640> here<00:07:39.210> in<00:07:39.440> this<00:07:40.440> soleus<00:07:41.070> area<00:07:41.520> by

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 
stretch down here in this soleus area by

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.120 
stretch down here in this soleus area by
bending<00:07:42.360> the<00:07:42.600> knee<00:07:42.780> I<00:07:43.050> still<00:07:43.650> want<00:07:43.860> to<00:07:43.890> focus

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.130 
bending the knee I still want to focus

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.510 
bending the knee I still want to focus
on<00:07:44.370> keeping<00:07:44.640> my<00:07:44.820> heel<00:07:45.240> down<00:07:46.190> so<00:07:47.190> we<00:07:47.280> get<00:07:47.430> in

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
on keeping my heel down so we get in

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.520 
on keeping my heel down so we get in
this<00:07:47.640> position<00:07:48.120> and<00:07:48.300> create<00:07:49.080> that<00:07:49.260> same

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530 
this position and create that same

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:55.070 
this position and create that same
pronation<00:07:51.350> again<00:07:52.350> ten<00:07:52.710> to<00:07:52.860> 20<00:07:53.190> reps<00:07:53.220> and<00:07:54.080> then

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 
pronation again ten to 20 reps and then

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.160 
pronation again ten to 20 reps and then
supination<00:07:56.180> with<00:07:57.180> that<00:07:57.420> knee<00:07:57.600> in<00:07:57.750> that<00:07:57.900> bent

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.170 
supination with that knee in that bent

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:06.140 
supination with that knee in that bent
position<00:07:58.380> slightly<00:08:02.990> 10<00:08:03.990> to<00:08:04.140> 20<00:08:04.440> reps<00:08:04.910> so<00:08:05.910> these

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.150 
position slightly 10 to 20 reps so these

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.750 
position slightly 10 to 20 reps so these
six<00:08:06.540> stretches<00:08:07.110> will<00:08:07.680> prepare<00:08:08.040> your<00:08:08.220> muscles

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:08.760 
six stretches will prepare your muscles

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.210 
six stretches will prepare your muscles
not<00:08:09.420> just<00:08:09.720> in<00:08:09.870> length<00:08:10.170> but<00:08:10.860> three

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 
not just in length but three

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.100 
not just in length but three
dimensionally<00:08:11.790> the<00:08:12.150> way<00:08:12.390> they<00:08:12.570> work<00:08:12.810> when<00:08:12.990> you

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.110 
dimensionally the way they work when you

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.960 
dimensionally the way they work when you
run<00:08:13.320> so<00:08:13.980> next<00:08:14.130> time<00:08:14.310> you're<00:08:14.460> going<00:08:14.610> for<00:08:14.760> a<00:08:14.820> run

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:14.970 
run so next time you're going for a run

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:20.120 
run so next time you're going for a run
