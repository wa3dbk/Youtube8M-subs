00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.300
 this letter is a photographic letter that 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.630
 I'll show you that he has more than 100 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.630
 dishes 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.530
 at the doors of our Peru's birthday 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.670
 the two flags dishes that looked like 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:33.530
 until rivals today they come together in a 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.530
 brilliant fusion of our gastronomy 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.730
 with you the ceviche on the grill 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.950
 this is the sin since the fat what 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.960
 let's warm up let's meet him 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.080
 medium term we are doing second 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.110
 so that it gives the taste of humility 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.110
 sweet potato yucca 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.770
 this dish is only jetty 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.770
 it's a curiosity 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.409
 Y 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 extraordinary 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.820
 and the Peruvian art of gastronomy 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.070
 Marine 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.070
 this time the cup deserves 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.140
 change 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.970
 this innovative creation that makes us 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.259
 water the mouth today exists thanks to a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.759
 meeting of three friends that was given to 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.830
 the beginning of the century the idea that the idea 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.670
 really arises simultaneously from the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 three because we were one day this 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.350
 have a beer in a bar 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.840
 and so between a couple of beers 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.470
 the Peruvian enterprise emerged with 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.850
 force and today results in 13 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:15.019
 top quality restaurants with quality 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.060
 of export at the beginning was the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.640
 illusion of three friends already has a 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.980
 own business 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.760
 to give more impulse Peruvian food 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.420
 and that's done now two years ago 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.600
 we open in guayaquil in ecuador makes a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.340
 week we have opened in Miami and we have 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.340
 expansion plans to other countries 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.370
 what is the name of this dish with what name 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.069
 he has asked pulpit to the belly that 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.770
 is burning 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.980
 I do not know will fight for the neighbor 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.340
 between the open rice because I do not 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.340
 I ask 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:02.579
 in this fork concentrates a 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.579
 murderous egg and banana shrimp 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.300
 the story started on the street 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.090
 alexander fleming in furrow in 2002 in 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.830
 the place that gave rise to everything 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.230
 that pier history 41 of 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.860
 growth that was the first local does 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.740
 12 years, 12 years, there were no more than 100 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.640
 dishes in your letter like today but the 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.280
 seasoning of the mothers of carlos de la flor 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.120
 guillermo del castillo and renzo 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.120
 castagnola was the cornerstone for 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.670
 that each client spread the word there is a 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.670
 place where you eat delicious 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.160
 and the name of the pier because 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.740
 anecdotal anecdotal guillermo he 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.900
 he was working in states for a while 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.950
 united in the bay of san francisco and 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.540
 there is the famous pierre faure one where 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.510
 dock the great ocean liners the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.340
 great cruises and good he proposed the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.230
 name each one for all his name 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.410
 We put the three pieces of paper in a 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.090
 this hat and this jetty came out 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.690
 41 and the truth that I loved the 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.690
 name also 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.510
 and from that little place in the south for today 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.270
 there are already a dozen more that make it 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.940
 in the largest chain of restaurants 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.940
 of marine food in Peru 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.849
 we have one francisco macÃ­as one of 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.610
 carnival and moreyra and be cool too 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.349
 in this area when they have this 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.000
 reference repeat a month and a half like this 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.160
 that is one of the most credits that 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.170
 we have 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.110
 and how we had to talk to 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.470
 knowledge of all those who 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.910
 we made weekly reports we made 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.330
 a stop in our work 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:19.730
 journalistic and we celebrate by 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.730
 Advance the national holidays 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.620
 but always the attitude to improve 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.830
 I always believe that it is the attitude of 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.830
 to have 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.010
 in these rojiblancas dates that better 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.570
 way to feel all the Peruvianness that 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:46.170
 with the freshness of our privileged 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.170
 marine gastronomy
