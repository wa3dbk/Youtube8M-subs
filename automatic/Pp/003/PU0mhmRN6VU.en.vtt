00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
uh that top position for sure I think

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.979 
uh that top position for sure I think
after<00:01:02.829> i<00:01:03.069> got<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.519> you<00:01:04.449> know<00:01:04.479> he<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:04.809> like

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.730 
after i got that you know he just like
anal<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:07.080> separate<00:01:08.080> yourself<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.470> little<00:01:08.530> bit

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
anal you separate yourself a little bit

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.520 
anal you separate yourself a little bit
those<00:01:08.890> guys<00:01:09.100> they'll<00:01:09.340> give<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.670> okay<00:01:10.530> when

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
those guys they'll give up okay when

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.040 
those guys they'll give up okay when
it's<00:01:11.650> a<00:01:11.710> close<00:01:11.920> match<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:13.600> feel<00:01:13.810> like<00:01:13.840> they

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
it's a close match they feel like they

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.410 
it's a close match they feel like they
have<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.200> chance<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.830> think<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.580> get<00:01:16.000> on<00:01:16.150> top<00:01:16.390> and

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
have a chance I think I get on top and

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.670 
have a chance I think I get on top and
put<00:01:16.720> two<00:01:16.780> legged<00:01:17.050> in<00:01:17.140> turn<00:01:17.320> them<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.620> think

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
when you have a 25 powder that's maybe a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.070 
when you have a 25 powder that's maybe a
little<00:01:43.540> bit<00:01:43.780> not<00:01:43.990> quite<00:01:44.020> as<00:01:44.530> spunky<00:01:44.860> as<00:01:45.100> he<00:01:45.340> is

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
little bit not quite as spunky as he is

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.810 
little bit not quite as spunky as he is
you<00:01:47.080> might<00:01:47.260> not<00:01:47.409> get<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.860> lift<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.400> little<00:01:48.580> bit

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820
