00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.600 
bait really fast in a constant and I
think<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.619> happens<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.040> when<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.429> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
think what happens is when they do that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.370 
think what happens is when they do that
is<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.030> fish<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.450> charges<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.049> all<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.290> way

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
is the fish just charges it all the way

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.750 
is the fish just charges it all the way
to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> boat<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.070> burst<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to the boat but when you burst it and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.160 
to the boat but when you burst it and
back<00:02:11.880> off<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.299> bit<00:02:12.510> burst<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.080> back

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
back off a little bit burst it and back

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.259 
back off a little bit burst it and back
off<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> fish<00:02:14.970> which

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
off you see you can see the fish which

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.720 
off you see you can see the fish which
you'll<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.040> specific<00:02:17.040> segment<00:02:17.430> they

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
you'll see in this specific segment they

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.850 
you'll see in this specific segment they
burst<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.269> on<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.260> burst<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.739> it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
burst up on it and they burst up on it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.650 
burst up on it and they burst up on it
and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.040> they<00:02:20.130> finally<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.430> take<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.030> well

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and then they finally just take it well

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.539 
and then they finally just take it well
it<00:02:21.720> takes<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.079> lazy<00:02:22.350> follow<00:02:22.739> which<00:02:23.280> we're<00:02:23.459> all

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
it takes a lazy follow which we're all

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.100 
it takes a lazy follow which we're all
familiar<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.480> turns<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.810> into<00:02:24.959> an

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
familiar with and it turns it into an

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.720 
familiar with and it turns it into an
aggressive<00:02:25.410> follow<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.519> aggressive

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
aggressive follow I like aggressive

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.450 
aggressive follow I like aggressive
follows<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.569> fishermen<00:02:28.730> yeah

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
follows the fishermen yeah

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.820 
follows the fishermen yeah
that<00:02:30.550> baits<00:02:30.790> doing<00:02:31.180> something<00:02:31.570> yes<00:02:31.720> yes<00:02:32.350> you

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
that baits doing something yes yes you

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.680 
that baits doing something yes yes you
won't<00:02:32.920> get<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.240> not<00:02:34.390> predictable

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
won't get that and it's not predictable

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.180 
won't get that and it's not predictable
part<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.260> me<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.410> don't<00:02:35.620> think<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.860> fish<00:02:36.010> can

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
part of me I don't think the fish can

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.770 
part of me I don't think the fish can
can<00:02:36.370> let<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.700> know<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:36.970> lock<00:02:37.180> into<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.600> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
can let you know can lock into it and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.090 
can let you know can lock into it and
they<00:02:37.870> can't<00:02:38.260> predict<00:02:38.650> what<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
they can't predict what it's going to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.590 
they can't predict what it's going to
happen<00:02:39.250> once<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.700> getting<00:02:40.000> confused
