00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
maybe 10 to 15 seconds then the camera

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
maybe 10 to 15 seconds then the camera
will<00:00:50.789> adjust<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.270> aperture<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.719> compensate

will adjust your aperture to compensate

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.310 
will adjust your aperture to compensate
and<00:00:52.469> you'll<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.920> shots<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and you'll get shots like this you can

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.360 
and you'll get shots like this you can
already<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.039> most<00:00:56.219> dramatic

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
already see that the most dramatic

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
already see that the most dramatic
transformation<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> car<00:00:57.840> lights<00:00:58.109> as

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
transformation is to the car lights as

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.990 
transformation is to the car lights as
they<00:00:58.770> move<00:00:58.949> through<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> frame<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.730> next

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
they move through the frame the next

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500 
they move through the frame the next
step<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> actually<00:01:03.539> paint<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.140> light

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
step is to actually paint with light

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.940 
step is to actually paint with light
this<00:01:06.510> statue<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.900> quite<00:01:07.110> dramatic<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this statue is quite dramatic it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
this statue is quite dramatic it
wouldn't<00:01:08.189> make<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> good<00:01:08.400> shot<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
wouldn't make a good shot as it is but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.020 
wouldn't make a good shot as it is but
it's<00:01:09.810> perfect<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.260> light<00:01:10.500> painting<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's perfect for light painting if you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.609 
it's perfect for light painting if you
shine<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> bright<00:01:12.390> light<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> subject

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

isn't<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
isn't it

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.660 
isn't it
taking<00:01:45.290> these<00:01:45.409> kind<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.740> shots<00:01:45.950> in<00:01:46.159> cities<00:01:46.460> is

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
taking these kind of shots in cities is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.370 
taking these kind of shots in cities is
inspiring<00:01:47.150> because<00:01:47.750> there's<00:01:48.050> plenty<00:01:48.320> of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
inspiring because there's plenty of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.410 
inspiring because there's plenty of
things<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.680> shoot<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.100> light<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:50.120> if<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.270> go

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
things to shoot and light but if you go
