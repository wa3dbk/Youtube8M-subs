00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
brackets so the ideal so is that you can

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.319 
brackets so the ideal so is that you can
have<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> unit<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> wall<00:00:37.790> in<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
have the unit on the wall in a in a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
have the unit on the wall in a in a
corner<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> room<00:00:39.870> etc<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.649> your<00:00:40.800> ceiling

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
corner of a room etc in your ceiling

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
corner of a room etc in your ceiling
area<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.329> although<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.780> said<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> mono

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
area so although I said this is a mono

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.690 
area so although I said this is a mono
unit<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.040> actually<00:00:44.280> got<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> couple<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
unit it's actually got a couple of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
unit it's actually got a couple of
speakers<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.860> can

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
speakers in here but only so that it can

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.979 
speakers in here but only so that it can
give<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> good<00:00:47.700> range<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.120> sound<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.690> don't

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
give a good range of sound so don't

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
give a good range of sound so don't
confuse<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> definitely<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
confuse this this is definitely there a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
confuse this this is definitely there a
unit<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> its<00:00:51.210> own<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.840> mono<00:00:52.050> unit<00:00:52.410> however

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
unit on its own it's a mono unit however

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
unit on its own it's a mono unit however
so<00:00:53.789> must<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.059> done<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> very<00:00:54.360> clever<00:00:54.570> thing

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so must have done a very clever thing

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.240 
so must have done a very clever thing
where<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.320> unit<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.800> combined<00:00:56.190> with

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
where this unit can be combined with

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
where this unit can be combined with
multiple<00:00:56.760> ones<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> single

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
multiple ones you have just a single

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.840 
multiple ones you have just a single
play<00:00:58.500> through<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.129> buy<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> pair<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
play through or you can buy a pair and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
play through or you can buy a pair and
then<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.930> them<00:01:01.230> configured<00:01:01.710> again

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
then you can have them configured again

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
then you can have them configured again
through<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> system<00:01:02.579> options<00:01:02.910> set<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.180> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
through the system options set up so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
through the system options set up so
that<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that one is the right and one is the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
that one is the right and one is the
left<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> full<00:01:06.659> stereo<00:01:07.110> spectrum

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
left so you get a full stereo spectrum

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
left so you get a full stereo spectrum
and<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.670> only<00:01:08.820> mains<00:01:09.210> power<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> unit

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and with only mains power to the unit

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.780 
and with only mains power to the unit
you<00:01:10.770> could<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> corner<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you could have in the corner of your

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.039 
you could have in the corner of your
room<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:12.960> clever<00:01:14.210> system<00:01:15.210> where<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
room a very clever system where you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.480 
room a very clever system where you
without<00:01:16.409> any<00:01:16.590> other<00:01:16.770> cables<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.340> wires

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
without any other cables or wires

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
without any other cables or wires
showing<00:01:17.790> you've<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.210> access<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.720> entire

amplifier as well as the speaker's very

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820 
amplifier as well as the speaker's very
much<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.119> play<00:01:24.299> five<00:01:24.710> it's<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
much like the play five it's a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.429 
much like the play five it's a
standalone<00:01:26.189> unit<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.630> were<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.080> only
