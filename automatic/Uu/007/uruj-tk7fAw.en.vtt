00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.780 

the<00:00:04.880> rain<00:00:05.060> Kevin<00:00:05.810> asks<00:00:06.170> us<00:00:06.350> is<00:00:07.069> there<00:00:07.460> anything

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
the rain Kevin asks us is there anything

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.549 
the rain Kevin asks us is there anything
else<00:00:08.149> I<00:00:08.389> should<00:00:08.420> do<00:00:08.840> for<00:00:09.080> this<00:00:09.200> longer

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
else I should do for this longer

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.710 
else I should do for this longer
distance<00:00:09.980> compared<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:10.790> training<00:00:11.480> for<00:00:11.690> a

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
distance compared to training for a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.070 
distance compared to training for a
marathon<00:00:12.080> this<00:00:12.920> is<00:00:13.160> a<00:00:13.190> 60<00:00:13.940> kilometer<00:00:14.480> off-road

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
marathon this is a 60 kilometer off-road

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.660 
marathon this is a 60 kilometer off-road
event<00:00:15.740> okay<00:00:16.610> well<00:00:17.420> essentially<00:00:18.349> I<00:00:18.500> see<00:00:19.220> their

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
event okay well essentially I see their

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.960 
event okay well essentially I see their
marathon<00:00:20.090> in<00:00:20.600> the<00:00:20.930> same<00:00:21.230> category<00:00:21.830> of<00:00:22.460> events

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
marathon in the same category of events

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.250 
marathon in the same category of events
as<00:00:23.270> ultra<00:00:23.869> razors<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:25.130> reason<00:00:25.460> is<00:00:25.609> this<00:00:25.880> a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
as ultra razors and the reason is this a

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.160 
as ultra razors and the reason is this a
marathon<00:00:27.260> requires<00:00:27.890> about<00:00:28.430> 99%<00:00:29.170> aerobic

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
marathon requires about 99% aerobic

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.380 
marathon requires about 99% aerobic
metabolism<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.070> it's<00:00:31.220> essentially<00:00:31.910> a<00:00:31.939> race

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
metabolism so it's essentially a race

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.840 
metabolism so it's essentially a race
that<00:00:33.019> is<00:00:33.199> based<00:00:33.500> on<00:00:33.769> preparing<00:00:34.430> for<00:00:34.699> it

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
that is based on preparing for it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.120 
that is based on preparing for it
through<00:00:35.300> building<00:00:36.170> your<00:00:36.350> aerobic<00:00:36.950> capacity

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
through building your aerobic capacity

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.000 
through building your aerobic capacity
your<00:00:38.000> endurance<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.170> same<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.469> true<00:00:39.710> for

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
your endurance the same is true for

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.000 
your endurance the same is true for
anything<00:00:40.850> over<00:00:41.450> that<00:00:41.570> distance<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:42.379> requires

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
anything over that distance it requires

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.900 
anything over that distance it requires
basic<00:00:43.480> aerobic<00:00:44.480> capacity<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.070> training

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
basic aerobic capacity so the training

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.700 
basic aerobic capacity so the training
should<00:00:47.180> be<00:00:47.329> geared<00:00:47.660> towards<00:00:48.140> building<00:00:48.410> your

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
should be geared towards building your

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.880 
should be geared towards building your
aerobic<00:00:49.399> capacity<00:00:49.719> now<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:50.780> better<00:00:51.620> you

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
aerobic capacity now the better you

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.580 
aerobic capacity now the better you
build<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.660> do<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.050> basically

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
build that and you do it basically

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
build that and you do it basically
through<00:00:55.809> as<00:00:56.809> many<00:00:57.050> miles<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.860> longer<00:00:58.370> type

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
through as many miles and longer type

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.860 
through as many miles and longer type
running<00:00:59.090> aerobic<00:01:00.020> running<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.969> further<00:01:02.780> you

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
running aerobic running the further you

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.290 
running aerobic running the further you
are<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.649> better<00:01:03.859> healthier<00:01:04.430> earn<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
are the better healthier earn the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.420 
are the better healthier earn the
greater<00:01:05.720> your<00:01:05.810> aerobic<00:01:06.470> capacity<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:07.250> better

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
greater your aerobic capacity the better

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.100 
greater your aerobic capacity the better
you're<00:01:07.610> going<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.909> do<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.240> marathon<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.960> an

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
you're going to do in a marathon and an

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.929 
you're going to do in a marathon and an
optimality<00:01:09.530> yes<00:01:09.770> what<00:01:10.250> about<00:01:10.340> recovery

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
optimality yes what about recovery

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.580 
optimality yes what about recovery
though<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.330> room<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.689> mean<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:12.200> know<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
though the room I mean that you know the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.340 
though the room I mean that you know the
tendency<00:01:13.310> for<00:01:13.479> marathon<00:01:14.479> resulted<00:01:15.049> optra

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
tendency for marathon resulted optra

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.830 
tendency for marathon resulted optra
distance<00:01:15.740> runners<00:01:16.100> us<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.610> just<00:01:17.030> simply<00:01:17.479> pile

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
distance runners us to just simply pile

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.039 
distance runners us to just simply pile
on<00:01:18.170> more<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:18.920> more<00:01:19.070> volume<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.540> know<00:01:20.689> get<00:01:20.900> out

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
on more and more volume you know get out

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.920 
on more and more volume you know get out
and<00:01:21.200> do<00:01:21.350> like<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.799> eight-hour<00:01:22.159> runs<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
and do like the eight-hour runs and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.510 
and do like the eight-hour runs and
running<00:01:23.930> every<00:01:24.500> hour<00:01:24.619> they<00:01:24.799> can<00:01:24.979> find<00:01:25.220> during

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
running every hour they can find during

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.390 
running every hour they can find during
the<00:01:25.549> week<00:01:25.790> yes<00:01:26.330> well<00:01:27.080> which<00:01:27.590> runner<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.189> going

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
the week yes well which runner is going

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.330 
the week yes well which runner is going
to<00:01:28.549> run<00:01:28.820> better<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:30.080> one<00:01:30.290> who<00:01:30.560> has<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.890> lot<00:01:31.310> of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
to run better the one who has a lot of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.749 
to run better the one who has a lot of
miles<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.909> is<00:01:32.630> exhausted<00:01:33.350> or<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.799> run<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.490> who

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
miles and is exhausted or to run one who

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.760 
miles and is exhausted or to run one who
has<00:01:35.000> run<00:01:35.720> less<00:01:36.020> miles<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.799> has<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> full<00:01:38.030> tank

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
has run less miles and has a full tank

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.280 
has run less miles and has a full tank
it's<00:01:39.770> pretty<00:01:39.979> obvious<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.570> there<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.140> little

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
it's pretty obvious so there is a little

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.710 
it's pretty obvious so there is a little
like<00:01:42.590> engine<00:01:42.979> for<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> start<00:01:43.549> right<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:44.270> is

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
like engine for a start right this is

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.109 
like engine for a start right this is
the<00:01:44.750> law<00:01:45.079> of<00:01:45.110> diminishing<00:01:45.439> returns<00:01:45.820> now<00:01:46.820> it

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
the law of diminishing returns now it

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.679 
the law of diminishing returns now it
that's<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.570> good<00:01:47.720> point<00:01:47.930> about<00:01:48.140> injury<00:01:48.890> because

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
that's a good point about injury because

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.889 
that's a good point about injury because
the<00:01:51.670> cardiovascular<00:01:52.670> system<00:01:52.700> responds<00:01:53.689> much

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
the cardiovascular system responds much

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.870 
the cardiovascular system responds much
more<00:01:54.170> quickly<00:01:54.439> than<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.340> musculoskeletal

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
more quickly than the musculoskeletal

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.990 
more quickly than the musculoskeletal
system<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:56.780> what<00:01:57.680> happens<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.640> runner

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
system and what happens is a runner

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.389 
system and what happens is a runner
develops<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.689> capacity<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.530> go<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.009> go<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.189> go

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
develops a capacity to go and go and go

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.499 
develops a capacity to go and go and go
but<00:02:02.299> what<00:02:02.659> goes<00:02:03.409> wrong<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.159> sore<00:02:04.790> knee<00:02:05.060> sore

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
but what goes wrong is a sore knee sore

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.280 
but what goes wrong is a sore knee sore
ankle<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.799> know<00:02:06.950> cartilage<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.479> know

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
ankle you know cartilage you know

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.150 
ankle you know cartilage you know
tendons<00:02:10.030> those<00:02:11.030> areas<00:02:11.599> that<00:02:11.900> don't<00:02:12.140> get<00:02:12.590> very

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
tendons those areas that don't get very

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.680 
tendons those areas that don't get very
good<00:02:13.310> blood<00:02:13.849> supply

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
good blood supply

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.810 
good blood supply
yeah<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:16.050> take<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> long<00:02:16.680> time<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.130> strengthen

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
yeah they take a long time to strengthen

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.080 
yeah they take a long time to strengthen
up<00:02:17.970> yes<00:02:18.570> see<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.260> cardio<00:02:19.620> system<00:02:20.460> responds

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
up yes see the cardio system responds

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
session and the musculoskeletal system

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.250 
session and the musculoskeletal system
depending<00:02:28.710> upon<00:02:28.820> how<00:02:29.840> intensity<00:02:30.840> exercise

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
depending upon how intensity exercise

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.980 
depending upon how intensity exercise
was<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.860> somewhere<00:02:32.460> between<00:02:32.520> two<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.480> five

four<00:02:56.820> year<00:02:57.090> training<00:02:57.540> program<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.920> they<00:02:58.950> build

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
four year training program so they build

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
four year training program so they build
up<00:02:59.850> for<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> Olympics<00:03:00.570> starts<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.320> four

up for the Olympics starts with a four

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.790 
up for the Olympics starts with a four
year<00:03:01.920> build<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.420> first<00:03:03.690> year<00:03:04.170> they

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
year build up and in the first year they

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.590 
year build up and in the first year they
will<00:03:05.070> spend<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.910> year<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:08.370> doing<00:03:08.850> pre<00:03:09.330> build

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
will spend the year just doing pre build

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.680 
will spend the year just doing pre build
up<00:03:09.860> they<00:03:10.860> put<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> backpack<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.940> they<00:03:12.240> go<00:03:12.450> in

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
up they put on a backpack and they go in

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.500 
up they put on a backpack and they go in
hike<00:03:13.050> for<00:03:13.530> hours<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.130> hours<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.490> hours<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
hike for hours and hours and hours the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.190 
hike for hours and hours and hours the
reason<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.080> do<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.830> build<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.730> their

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
reason they do that is to build up their

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.590 
reason they do that is to build up their
musculoskeletal<00:03:19.200> system<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.670> then<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:21.480> are

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
musculoskeletal system so then they are

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.020 
musculoskeletal system so then they are
ready<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.170> handle<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.709> big<00:03:22.920> miles<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.820> will

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
ready to handle the big miles that will

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.880 
ready to handle the big miles that will
be<00:03:24.180> required<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.870> them<00:03:25.050> in<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.500> subsequent

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
be required of them in the subsequent

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.699 
be required of them in the subsequent
years<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.120> they<00:03:27.540> do<00:03:27.600> big<00:03:27.900> malls<00:03:28.140> don't<00:03:28.530> they

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
years and they do big malls don't they

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.240 
years and they do big malls don't they
they<00:03:29.040> they<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.820> handle<00:03:30.120> say<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.709> know<00:03:31.860> 200

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
they they can handle say you know 200

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.460 
they they can handle say you know 200
kilometers<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> week<00:03:33.360> these<00:03:33.959> tiny<00:03:34.350> little

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
kilometers a week these tiny little

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.920 
kilometers a week these tiny little
woman<00:03:35.040> running<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.790> know<00:03:35.910> these<00:03:36.120> mega<00:03:36.450> miles

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
woman running you know these mega miles

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.080 
woman running you know these mega miles
and<00:03:37.140> they<00:03:37.560> don't<00:03:37.709> break<00:03:38.010> down<00:03:38.280> because<00:03:38.850> they

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
and they don't break down because they

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.050 
and they don't break down because they
have<00:03:39.300> spent<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.840> lot<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> time<00:03:40.400> preparing<00:03:41.400> the

body to be able to take those stresses
I've<00:03:44.970> always<00:03:45.360> thought<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.750> hiking<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.890> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
I've always thought that hiking with a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.699 
I've always thought that hiking with a
pack<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.700> know<00:03:47.820> multi<00:03:48.239> day<00:03:48.420> hikes<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.110> just<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
pack you know multi day hikes is just a

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.890 
pack you know multi day hikes is just a
fantastic<00:03:50.430> form<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.269> endurance<00:03:51.690> training

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
fantastic form of endurance training

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.080 
fantastic form of endurance training
well<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.680> probably<00:03:53.160> why<00:03:53.400> somebody<00:03:53.880> like

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
well it's probably why somebody like

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.240 
well it's probably why somebody like
