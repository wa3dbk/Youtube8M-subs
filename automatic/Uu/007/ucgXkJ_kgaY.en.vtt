00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 graceful on his lots very handsome chic is 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.330
 in danger 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.030
 so we will use our own hair 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.030
 or recreate a pressed tiara 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.120
 this hairstyle is suitable for all 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.040
 lengths and texture of the hair 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.660
 you can accomplish and 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.150
 long hair on the mid-length hair 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
 on straight wavy or curly hair 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.739
 but that my own hair is very 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.050
 fine and I prefer to have hair 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.830
 long and b I start by attaching my 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.910
 extensions learned from the brand 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.550
 as usual I use a blond 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.879
 clear and dark blue to create an effect 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.879
 wicks 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.870
 then I know by a lock of hair 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.600
 above my head I'll use 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 this wick to create the 13 central 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 here you have to take three hd movies 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 hair in the back and started to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 to pass the locks exterio below 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 the wick of the middle we cross the wicks 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 like that three times then we add a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.130
 little hair dropped at the wick of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130
 middle 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.550
 no 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.860
 we meet the outside matches two 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.360
 time and then we add a little hair 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.360
 dropped to the middle wick 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.630
 and then we cross 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.100
 wallace 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.100
 and we will go days 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.490
 we cross 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.409
 we cross 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.409
 and we add 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.390
 2 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.390
 and so on until the francs 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.530
 now we have to separate the powers 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.950
 of our press in two equal parts 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.900
 and plot each part according to the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.340
 length of your hair you can 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.020

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.250
 different for example if your hair 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.390
 you can tie the two braids 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.430
 together at the back of your head 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.590
 my hair is almost long enough to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.200
 hundred but as the point of emitting to his 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.240
 hyper end i prefer to do another 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.550
 something that is best for mid hair 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.170
