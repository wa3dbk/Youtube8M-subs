acid a very very long name but you will

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.560 
acid a very very long name but you will
see<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.529> represented<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:23.220> DNA<00:00:23.820> all

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
see that it be represented with DNA all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
see that it be represented with DNA all
over<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.930> time<00:00:25.170> DNA<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.670> makes

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
over the time DNA is what makes

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
nails are formed it's everything about

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
nails are formed it's everything about
you<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:01.079> comes<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:01.829> our<00:01:02.100> chromosomes

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you and me comes from our chromosomes

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
you and me comes from our chromosomes
now<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.090> haven't<00:01:03.480> always<00:01:03.660> known<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.619> DNA<00:01:05.250> was

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
now we haven't always known what DNA was

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.640 
now we haven't always known what DNA was
because<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.229> secret<00:01:08.150> code<00:01:09.380> as<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> matter

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
because it was a secret code as a matter

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.480 
because it was a secret code as a matter
of<00:01:10.710> fact<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.280> talk<00:01:11.430> about

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
of fact what we're going to talk about

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
of fact what we're going to talk about
today<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> beginning<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.840> unlocking<00:01:14.060> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
today is the beginning of unlocking that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.039 
today is the beginning of unlocking that
secret<00:01:15.509> code

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
secret code

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.499 
secret code
the<00:01:16.710> problem<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.250> DNA<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.240> didn't

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the problem with DNA was that we didn't

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
the problem with DNA was that we didn't
know<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> meant<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> found

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
know really what it meant what we found

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.440 
know really what it meant what we found
out<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.259> DNA<00:01:22.259> had<00:01:22.590> three<00:01:23.310> skinny<00:01:24.119> four

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
out was that DNA had three skinny four

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.070 
out was that DNA had three skinny four
different<00:01:25.380> parts<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
different parts a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.640 
different parts a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
mean and those were the four things that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.929 
mean and those were the four things that
were<00:01:37.110> found<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> DNA<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.640> matter<00:01:38.880> fact

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
were found in all of DNA as matter fact

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.020 
were found in all of DNA as matter fact
days<00:01:39.360> ago<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.990> these<00:01:40.369> C's<00:01:41.369> always<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.939> with

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
days ago with these C's always go with

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.929 
days ago with these C's always go with
G's<00:01:42.329> that's<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> only<00:01:43.259> combinations<00:01:44.009> G's<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
G's that's the only combinations G's and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
G's that's the only combinations G's and
C's<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.299> together<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.840> A's<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.350> T's<00:01:46.530> go

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
C's go together and A's and T's go

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
C's go together and A's and T's go
together<00:01:46.890> now<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> easy<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.030> remember<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
together now the easy way to remember it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.039 
together now the easy way to remember it
is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.829> T<00:01:50.250> both<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.820> straight<00:01:51.210> lines<00:01:51.540> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
is a and T both have straight lines so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.160 
is a and T both have straight lines so
they<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.380> together<00:01:53.030> c's<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.060> g's<00:01:54.360> are<00:01:54.810> curb

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they go together c's and g's are curb

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
they go together c's and g's are curb
letters<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.799> they<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.159> together<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.790> an

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
letters so they go together so that's an

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.109 
letters so they go together so that's an
easy<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> remember<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> take

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
easy way to remember it now if you take

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.709 
easy way to remember it now if you take
a<00:02:00.180> piece<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.719> DNA<00:02:03.979> I'm<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.250> picking<00:02:05.719> some

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
a piece of DNA I'm just picking some

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.059 
a piece of DNA I'm just picking some
what<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.170> call<00:02:08.780> nucleotides<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> word

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
what we call nucleotides just a word

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.520 
what we call nucleotides just a word
that<00:02:11.099> sometimes<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:11.849> use<00:02:12.319> nucleotides<00:02:13.319> are

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that sometimes they use nucleotides are

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
that sometimes they use nucleotides are

real quick and jot down this piece of
DNA<00:02:24.650> alright<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.190> paused<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
DNA alright now that you paused and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.760 
DNA alright now that you paused and
you've<00:02:27.270> written<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.930> down<00:02:28.170> let's<00:02:28.470> talk

about<00:02:28.920> I'll<00:02:29.550> take<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.910> word<00:02:30.210> out<00:02:30.390> let's<00:02:30.990> talk

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
about I'll take this word out let's talk

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.860 
about I'll take this word out let's talk
about<00:02:31.350> what<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.770> called<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.870> complimentary

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
about what is called the complimentary

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.840 
about what is called the complimentary
complimentary<00:02:36.740> strand<00:02:37.740> they<00:02:38.340> love<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.700> use

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
complimentary strand they love to use

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.120 
complimentary strand they love to use
this<00:02:39.060> word<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:39.480> well<00:02:39.620> complementary<00:02:40.620> means<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
this word as well complementary means it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.250 
this word as well complementary means it
complements<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.880> goes<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.600> well<00:02:42.780> we

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
complements and it goes with it well we

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.460 
complements and it goes with it well we
know<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> aids<00:02:43.740> go<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.130> T's<00:02:44.340> T<00:02:45.240> goes<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.750> C

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
know that aids go with T's T goes a C

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.300 
know that aids go with T's T goes a C
goes<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:46.920> G<00:02:47.160> G<00:02:47.970> goes<00:02:48.210> with<00:02:48.420> C<00:02:48.780> C<00:02:49.590> goes<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:50.070> G

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
goes with G G goes with C C goes with G

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.100 
goes with G G goes with C C goes with G
C<00:02:50.730> goes<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.210> G<00:02:51.450> T<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.190> T<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.720> C

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
C goes with G T is a a is T this is C

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.440 
C goes with G T is a a is T this is C
and<00:02:55.290> G<00:02:55.500> go<00:02:55.530> together<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.310> G<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.090> C<00:02:57.240> go

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
and G go together and G and C go

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.970 
and G go together and G and C go
together<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> complementary

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
together so this is a complementary

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.340 
together so this is a complementary
strand<00:02:59.040> now<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.700> would<00:02:59.850> be<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> piece<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.750> DNA

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
strand now this would be a piece of DNA

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.380 
strand now this would be a piece of DNA
but<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.740> not<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.310> ever<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.030> straight

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but it's not really ever in a straight

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.600 
but it's not really ever in a straight
line<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.110> matter<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.010> fact<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.400> looks

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
line like this matter of fact it looks

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.940 
line like this matter of fact it looks
more<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:07.080> not<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.380> great<00:03:07.650> picture

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
more like a that's not a great picture

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.670 
more like a that's not a great picture
here's<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.520> better<00:03:08.700> picture<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:10.320> piece<00:03:10.530> of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
here's a better picture of a piece of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.790 
here's a better picture of a piece of
DNA<00:03:11.070> they<00:03:11.580> call<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.030> double<00:03:12.390> helix<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.680> that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
DNA they call it a double helix and that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.290 
DNA they call it a double helix and that
double<00:03:14.100> helix<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.550> almost<00:03:14.820> look<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.210> they're

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
double helix it almost look and they're

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.120 
double helix it almost look and they're
attached<00:03:15.600> through<00:03:15.990> here<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.800> you

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
attached through here like this you

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190 
attached through here like this you
probably<00:03:17.790> all<00:03:17.970> remember<00:03:18.150> pictures<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:18.960> this

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
probably all remember pictures like this

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.110 
probably all remember pictures like this
looks<00:03:19.800> like<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.040> took<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.280> ladder<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.820> just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
looks like you took a ladder and just

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.680 
looks like you took a ladder and just
sort<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.510> twisted<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.680> itself<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:24.300> we<00:03:24.450> draw

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
sort of twisted it on itself but we draw

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.150 
sort of twisted it on itself but we draw
it<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.990> straight<00:03:25.260> line<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.770> can<00:03:25.800> put<00:03:26.070> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
it in a straight line so we can put it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.060 
it in a straight line so we can put it
on<00:03:26.220> paper<00:03:26.430> very<00:03:26.820> easily<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.840> inside<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.680> DNA

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
on paper very easily now inside this DNA

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.950 
on paper very easily now inside this DNA
could<00:03:29.250> be<00:03:29.310> anything<00:03:29.670> that's<00:03:30.450> what<00:03:30.660> was<00:03:30.840> so

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
could be anything that's what was so

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.930 
could be anything that's what was so
confusing<00:03:31.410> about<00:03:31.680> or<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.100> secret<00:03:32.400> code<00:03:32.730> that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
confusing about or the secret code that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.910 
confusing about or the secret code that
had<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.150> do<00:03:33.270> with<00:03:33.300> DNA<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.260> a's<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.680> b's<00:03:34.740> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
had to do with DNA the a's and b's and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.500 
had to do with DNA the a's and b's and
c's<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.460> g's<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:36.000> depended<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
c's and g's it depended on the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.200 
c's and g's it depended on the
combination<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.410> what<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.220> meant<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.120> took

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
combination on what it meant so it took

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.270 
combination on what it meant so it took
us<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.420> really<00:03:39.570> long<00:03:39.870> time<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.710> figure<00:03:40.890> out<00:03:41.070> what

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
us a really long time to figure out what

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.310 
us a really long time to figure out what
it<00:03:41.400> now<00:03:41.790> what<00:03:41.970> we're<00:03:42.090> going<00:03:42.210> to<00:03:42.330> do<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.840> this

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
it now what we're going to do in this

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.560 
it now what we're going to do in this
activity<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:43.980> we're<00:03:44.190> going<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.550> take<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.330> DNA

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
activity is we're going to take that DNA

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.210 
activity is we're going to take that DNA
and<00:03:46.080> we'll<00:03:46.170> go<00:03:46.260> ahead<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.590> give<00:03:46.710> you<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.860> title

and we'll go ahead and give you a title
real<00:03:47.580> quick<00:03:47.850> we're<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.570> talk<00:03:48.810> about<00:03:48.960> DNA

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
real quick we're going to talk about DNA

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.750 
real quick we're going to talk about DNA
replication<00:03:53.960> means<00:03:54.960> to<00:03:55.260> reproduce<00:03:56.070> or<00:03:56.490> i'll

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
replication means to reproduce or i'll

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.550 
replication means to reproduce or i'll
give<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> better<00:03:57.150> word<00:03:57.470> duplicate<00:04:00.560> your

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
give you a better word duplicate your

wanna<00:04:14.580> pause<00:04:17.270> alright<00:04:18.270> and<00:04:18.450> then<00:04:18.690> we'll<00:04:18.900> take

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
wanna pause alright and then we'll take

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.770 
wanna pause alright and then we'll take
the<00:04:19.230> complementary<00:04:19.799> strand<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.580> T<00:04:21.500> G<00:04:22.550> G<00:04:23.550> C<00:04:24.390> T<00:04:24.690> G

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
the complementary strand a T G G C T G

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.400 
the complementary strand a T G G C T G
a<00:04:26.639> team<00:04:27.970> there's<00:04:28.660> my<00:04:28.780> complementary

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
a team there's my complementary

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.560 
a team there's my complementary
strengths<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.460> works<00:04:30.700> out<00:04:30.850> pretty<00:04:30.970> good<00:04:31.120> so

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
strengths that works out pretty good so

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.710 
strengths that works out pretty good so
we're<00:04:31.840> gonna<00:04:31.930> add<00:04:32.170> something<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.680> here<00:04:33.120> TGG

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.260 

ct1<00:04:37.720> let's<00:04:37.900> take<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:39.550> what<00:04:39.940> would<00:04:40.120> go

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
ct1 let's take that and so what would go

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.330 
ct1 let's take that and so what would go
with<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.630> would<00:04:40.810> be<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:41.169> C<00:04:42.130> c/g<00:04:43.980> hey<00:04:44.980> maybe

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
with that would be a C c/g hey maybe

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.710 
with that would be a C c/g hey maybe
wanna<00:04:45.460> pause<00:04:45.700> real<00:04:45.940> quick<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.270> get<00:04:46.389> that<00:04:46.570> in

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
wanna pause real quick to get that in

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.210 
wanna pause real quick to get that in
get<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.110> picture<00:04:47.380> now<00:04:50.010> here's<00:04:51.010> what's

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
get that picture now here's what's

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.310 
get that picture now here's what's
happening<00:04:51.669> whenever<00:04:52.240> we<00:04:52.600> want<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.900> replicate

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
happening whenever we want to replicate

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.340 
happening whenever we want to replicate
or<00:04:53.860> reproduce<00:04:54.760> our<00:04:54.970> DNA<00:04:55.419> here's<00:04:55.870> why<00:04:56.050> we<00:04:56.200> would

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
or reproduce our DNA here's why we would

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.840 
or reproduce our DNA here's why we would
do<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.710> we<00:04:57.010> talked<00:04:57.280> about<00:04:57.400> in<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.700> last

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
do that we talked about in the last

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.730 
do that we talked about in the last
session<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.570> you're<00:04:58.750> going<00:04:59.020> to<00:04:59.140> reproduce

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
session that you're going to reproduce

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.610 
session that you're going to reproduce
cells<00:05:00.100> sometimes<00:05:00.400> cells<00:05:01.390> get<00:05:01.660> old<00:05:01.870> cells<00:05:02.320> need

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
cells sometimes cells get old cells need

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.580 
cells sometimes cells get old cells need
to<00:05:02.890> be<00:05:03.419> changed<00:05:04.419> out<00:05:04.570> sometimes<00:05:05.260> there's

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
to be changed out sometimes there's

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.970 
to be changed out sometimes there's
damage<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.310> cell<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:07.419> have<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:08.050> get

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
damage to a cell and so you have to get

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.740 
damage to a cell and so you have to get
a<00:05:09.010> new<00:05:09.190> cell<00:05:09.490> in<00:05:09.760> order<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.210> do<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.540> you're

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
a new cell in order to do that you're

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.090 
a new cell in order to do that you're
going<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:10.960> take<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.290> secret<00:05:11.620> coat<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:11.950> one

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
going to take the secret coat of one

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.760 
going to take the secret coat of one
cell<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.640> you're<00:05:13.180> going<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.330> give<00:05:13.480> a<00:05:13.510> copy<00:05:13.780> the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
cell and you're going to give a copy the

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.560 
cell and you're going to give a copy the
other<00:05:15.010> cell<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:15.700> here's<00:05:16.030> how<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.210> works

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
other cell so here's how it works

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.659 
other cell so here's how it works
an<00:05:16.690> enzyme<00:05:17.290> comes<00:05:17.800> along<00:05:18.190> and<00:05:18.340> you'll<00:05:18.430> notice

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
an enzyme comes along and you'll notice

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.830 
an enzyme comes along and you'll notice
from<00:05:18.760> this<00:05:18.910> picture<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:19.300> almost<00:05:19.450> looks<00:05:19.690> like<00:05:19.750> a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
from this picture it almost looks like a

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.600 
from this picture it almost looks like a
zipper<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.740> that's<00:05:20.950> exactly<00:05:21.370> what<00:05:21.490> the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
zipper and that's exactly what the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.150 
zipper and that's exactly what the
enzyme<00:05:21.760> does<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.660> takes<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.680> starts<00:05:23.979> to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
enzyme does it takes and it starts to

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.480 
enzyme does it takes and it starts to
unzip<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:25.720> DNA<00:05:26.200> now<00:05:26.710> what's<00:05:26.919> special<00:05:27.100> about

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
unzip the DNA now what's special about

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.990 
unzip the DNA now what's special about
this<00:05:27.910> is<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.720> when<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.050> starts<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.500> unzip<00:05:30.460> it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
this is that when it starts to unzip it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.270 
this is that when it starts to unzip it
a<00:05:31.180> weird<00:05:31.660> process<00:05:31.990> starts<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.650> take<00:05:32.830> place<00:05:32.860> and

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
a weird process starts to take place and

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.719 
a weird process starts to take place and
let<00:05:33.400> me<00:05:33.520> explain<00:05:34.229> aids<00:05:35.229> and<00:05:35.680> t's<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.370> c's<00:05:36.430> and

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
let me explain aids and t's and c's and

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.420 
let me explain aids and t's and c's and
g's<00:05:37.150> are<00:05:37.690> floating<00:05:38.530> around<00:05:38.650> in<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.190> cell

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
g's are floating around in the cell

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.400 
g's are floating around in the cell
looking<00:05:39.880> for<00:05:40.180> somewhere<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.630> put<00:05:40.840> on<00:05:41.020> so

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
looking for somewhere to put on so

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.680 
looking for somewhere to put on so
they're<00:05:41.560> just<00:05:41.760> floating<00:05:42.760> along<00:05:42.880> sort<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:43.570> like

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
they're just floating along sort of like

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.560 
they're just floating along sort of like
a<00:05:43.720> piece<00:05:44.020> of<00:05:44.229> velcro<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:45.550> what<00:05:45.789> happens<00:05:46.300> is

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
a piece of velcro and so what happens is

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.110 
a piece of velcro and so what happens is
when<00:05:47.140> you<00:05:47.410> get<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:47.890> a<00:05:47.919> point<00:05:48.190> where<00:05:48.520> it's<00:05:48.700> open

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
when you get to a point where it's open

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.060 
when you get to a point where it's open
like<00:05:49.270> this<00:05:49.539> automatically<00:05:50.500> they<00:05:50.710> start

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
like this automatically they start

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.390 
like this automatically they start
plugging<00:05:51.430> in<00:05:51.870> where<00:05:52.870> they<00:05:53.020> go<00:05:53.200> T's<00:05:53.979> go<00:05:54.220> with

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
plugging in where they go T's go with

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.290 
plugging in where they go T's go with
AIDS<00:05:54.610> see<00:05:55.330> G<00:05:55.930> G<00:05:56.530> C<00:05:57.100> G<00:05:58.060> C<00:05:58.720> T<00:05:59.130> hey<00:06:00.130> and<00:06:01.060> so<00:06:01.180> they

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
AIDS see G G C G C T hey and so they

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.880 
AIDS see G G C G C T hey and so they
just<00:06:01.330> find<00:06:01.720> a<00:06:01.810> place<00:06:01.990> to<00:06:02.169> plug<00:06:02.320> on<00:06:02.530> the<00:06:02.710> same

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
just find a place to plug on the same

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.670 
just find a place to plug on the same
thing<00:06:03.100> happens<00:06:03.430> here<00:06:03.520> it<00:06:04.180> goes<00:06:04.479> with<00:06:04.660> T<00:06:04.690> G<00:06:05.169> goes

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
thing happens here it goes with T G goes

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.390 
thing happens here it goes with T G goes
with<00:06:05.890> C<00:06:06.130> C<00:06:06.880> goes<00:06:07.120> with<00:06:07.330> G<00:06:07.570> C<00:06:08.320> goes<00:06:08.500> with<00:06:08.740> G<00:06:08.950> and

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
with C C goes with G C goes with G and

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.790 
with C C goes with G C goes with G and
it<00:06:09.520> goes<00:06:09.669> with<00:06:09.850> team<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.510> so<00:06:10.900> they<00:06:11.320> just<00:06:11.350> plug

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
it goes with team and so they just plug

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.320 
it goes with team and so they just plug
on<00:06:11.979> now<00:06:12.160> you'll<00:06:12.340> notice<00:06:12.550> if<00:06:12.729> I<00:06:12.820> cover<00:06:13.090> up<00:06:13.180> my

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
on now you'll notice if I cover up my

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.050 
on now you'll notice if I cover up my
DNA<00:06:13.750> right<00:06:13.960> here<00:06:14.200> it's<00:06:15.039> exactly<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:15.850> same

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
DNA right here it's exactly the same

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
same you're duplicating your DNA so what

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.180 
same you're duplicating your DNA so what
happens<00:06:31.510> is<00:06:31.660> as<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.990> enzyme<00:06:32.350> slowly<00:06:32.710> opens

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
happens is as that enzyme slowly opens

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.550 
happens is as that enzyme slowly opens
up<00:06:33.370> that<00:06:33.580> piece<00:06:33.760> of<00:06:33.909> B

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
and c's and g's are going to plug in and

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.800 
and c's and g's are going to plug in and
when<00:06:38.879> you<00:06:38.969> get<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:39.330> very<00:06:39.479> end<00:06:39.569> you're

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
when you get to the very end you're

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.119 
when you get to the very end you're
going<00:06:39.960> to<00:06:40.020> have<00:06:40.110> two<00:06:40.319> strands<00:06:40.710> that<00:06:40.949> look

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
going to have two strands that look

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.100 
going to have two strands that look
identical<00:06:41.490> to<00:06:41.969> each<00:06:42.060> other<00:06:42.300> that's<00:06:42.870> going<00:06:43.050> to

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
identical to each other that's going to

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.179 
identical to each other that's going to
take<00:06:43.289> a<00:06:43.319> little<00:06:43.499> bit<00:06:43.680> to<00:06:43.830> happen<00:06:44.099> because

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
take a little bit to happen because

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.999 
take a little bit to happen because
you've<00:06:44.490> got<00:06:44.610> to<00:06:44.699> do<00:06:44.789> all<00:06:44.969> 46<00:06:45.689> chromosomes<00:06:46.050> so

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
you've got to do all 46 chromosomes so

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.279 
you've got to do all 46 chromosomes so
it<00:06:47.159> does<00:06:47.340> it<00:06:47.370> pretty<00:06:47.669> quickly<00:06:47.969> in<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:49.080> cell

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
it does it pretty quickly in the cell

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.200 
it does it pretty quickly in the cell
but<00:06:49.469> it<00:06:49.560> takes<00:06:49.710> a<00:06:49.860> little<00:06:50.009> bit<00:06:50.159> of<00:06:50.279> time<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:50.819> so

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
but it takes a little bit of time and so

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.580 
but it takes a little bit of time and so
what<00:06:51.360> ends<00:06:51.539> up<00:06:51.629> happening<00:06:51.689> is<00:06:52.199> you<00:06:52.379> have<00:06:52.409> a

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
what ends up happening is you have a

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.309 
what ends up happening is you have a
cell<00:06:52.919> that<00:06:53.159> no<00:06:53.639> longer<00:06:54.090> has<00:06:54.270> 46<00:06:54.930> chromosomes

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
cell that no longer has 46 chromosomes

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.860 
cell that no longer has 46 chromosomes
it<00:06:56.279> has<00:06:56.430> 92<00:06:56.879> chromosomes

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
it has 92 chromosomes

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.050 
it has 92 chromosomes
well<00:06:58.319> self<00:06:58.620> cannot<00:06:58.860> have<00:06:59.189> a<00:06:59.460> human<00:06:59.789> self

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
well self cannot have a human self

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.450 
well self cannot have a human self
cannot<00:07:00.300> have<00:07:00.569> 92<00:07:01.050> chromosomes<00:07:01.379> in<00:07:01.770> it<00:07:01.889> so<00:07:02.310> it's

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
cannot have 92 chromosomes in it so it's

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.580 
cannot have 92 chromosomes in it so it's
going<00:07:02.610> to<00:07:02.699> have<00:07:02.879> to<00:07:03.029> split<00:07:03.300> into<00:07:03.719> two<00:07:04.259> and

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
going to have to split into two and

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.800 
going to have to split into two and
what's<00:07:04.860> going<00:07:05.099> to<00:07:05.189> happen<00:07:05.669> is<00:07:06.419> that<00:07:06.479> you're

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
what's going to happen is that you're

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.159 
what's going to happen is that you're
going<00:07:06.870> to<00:07:07.139> get<00:07:07.439> two<00:07:07.919> cells<00:07:08.279> that<00:07:08.580> each<00:07:08.789> have<00:07:09.169> 46

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
going to get two cells that each have 46

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.800 
going to get two cells that each have 46
chromosomes<00:07:10.860> and<00:07:11.370> they<00:07:11.759> look<00:07:11.969> just<00:07:11.999> like<00:07:12.449> the

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
chromosomes and they look just like the

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.200 
chromosomes and they look just like the
original<00:07:13.289> so<00:07:13.770> when<00:07:14.430> if<00:07:14.639> you<00:07:14.759> look<00:07:14.969> back<00:07:15.150> at

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
original so when if you look back at

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.829 
original so when if you look back at
your<00:07:15.479> notes<00:07:15.539> to<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:17.009> cell<00:07:17.400> and<00:07:17.669> mitosis<00:07:18.539> from

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:18.839 
your notes to the cell and mitosis from

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.290 
your notes to the cell and mitosis from
our<00:07:18.990> last<00:07:19.169> lesson<00:07:19.529> you'll<00:07:20.400> see<00:07:20.669> that<00:07:20.909> when<00:07:21.180> we

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
our last lesson you'll see that when we

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.730 
our last lesson you'll see that when we
wrote<00:07:21.479> interphase<00:07:22.080> prophase<00:07:22.710> metaphase

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
wrote interphase prophase metaphase

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.269 
wrote interphase prophase metaphase
anaphase<00:07:23.310> and<00:07:24.029> telophase<00:07:24.060> in<00:07:24.949> prophase<00:07:25.949> your

anaphase and telophase in prophase your

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.640 
anaphase and telophase in prophase your
DNA<00:07:26.699> doubles<00:07:27.150> this<00:07:27.599> is<00:07:27.749> how<00:07:27.900> it<00:07:28.020> happens<00:07:28.439> and

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
DNA doubles this is how it happens and

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.119 
DNA doubles this is how it happens and
take<00:07:29.430> the<00:07:29.610> DNA<00:07:29.849> you<00:07:30.210> unzip<00:07:30.930> it<00:07:31.110> you<00:07:31.650> plug<00:07:31.979> in

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:32.129 
take the DNA you unzip it you plug in

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.679 
take the DNA you unzip it you plug in
the<00:07:32.249> parts<00:07:32.550> that<00:07:32.639> are<00:07:32.879> floating<00:07:33.240> around<00:07:33.360> like

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:33.689 
the parts that are floating around like

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:35.360 
the parts that are floating around like
velcro<00:07:33.990> and<00:07:34.349> by<00:07:34.469> the<00:07:34.529> time<00:07:34.830> you've<00:07:34.979> unzipped

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.370 
velcro and by the time you've unzipped

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.939 
velcro and by the time you've unzipped
it<00:07:35.490> all<00:07:35.610> the<00:07:35.759> way<00:07:35.879> to<00:07:35.939> be<00:07:36.180> in<00:07:36.330> you<00:07:36.839> now<00:07:36.990> have<00:07:37.319> two

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:37.949 
it all the way to be in you now have two

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.740 
it all the way to be in you now have two
sets<00:07:38.310> that<00:07:38.490> look<00:07:38.669> identical<00:07:38.849> to<00:07:39.389> each<00:07:39.419> other

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
sets that look identical to each other

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.159 
sets that look identical to each other
so<00:07:40.199> you<00:07:40.259> end<00:07:40.469> up<00:07:40.560> having<00:07:40.710> one<00:07:41.159> set<00:07:41.990> that<00:07:42.990> goes

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
so you end up having one set that goes

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:45.740 
so you end up having one set that goes
in<00:07:43.409> one<00:07:43.649> cell<00:07:43.949> and<00:07:44.759> you<00:07:45.270> have<00:07:45.389> another<00:07:45.629> set

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.750 
in one cell and you have another set

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.829 
in one cell and you have another set
that<00:07:46.589> goes<00:07:46.740> in<00:07:46.949> another<00:07:47.129> cell<00:07:47.460> and<00:07:47.639> now<00:07:48.509> both

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:48.839 
that goes in another cell and now both

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.540 
that goes in another cell and now both
cells<00:07:49.139> are<00:07:49.319> identical<00:07:49.439> to<00:07:50.009> each<00:07:50.039> other<00:07:50.339> and

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550 
cells are identical to each other and

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.700 
cells are identical to each other and
they<00:07:50.909> have<00:07:51.120> exactly<00:07:51.479> the<00:07:51.779> same<00:07:51.810> chromosomes

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710 
they have exactly the same chromosomes

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.339 
they have exactly the same chromosomes
this<00:07:53.250> is<00:07:53.430> how<00:07:53.580> you<00:07:53.669> duplicate<00:07:54.330> yourselves<00:07:55.169> and

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:55.349 
this is how you duplicate yourselves and

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:59.389 
this is how you duplicate yourselves and
the<00:07:56.039> DNA<00:07:56.460> that's<00:07:57.029> in<00:07:57.240> them
