 many years ago instead of the prince of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.780
 darkness came the triforce of force 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.639
 Princess Zelda owned the triforce of the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 wisdom 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.599

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.789
 past to hide before you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.400
 was abducted 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.830
 loos link find the compartments around yourself 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 to rescue 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.470
 This is not a quote from one 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.040
 fairy tale or an old saying this is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.489
 the prologue to a legend of the legend of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.489
 himself 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.940
 a little boy always just flies it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.040
 with a lamp in hand in one 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.619
 cave to go near his village 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.080
 This kid washing guerrilla motor 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.240
 which later should find super mario 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.280
 and after his great success a game 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.440
 which wanted to develop his decker 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.600
 should reflect potion at that time 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.250
 he has this with the legend of zelda as well 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.170
 it was the first game 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.509
 which is not one of them 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.640
 level sent to the next but me 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 free customers left differently like that 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.890
 today 's game takes on the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.080
 hand 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.850
 It will just get you into the game 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 that is, if you are too stupid in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.710
 cave you will go at the beginning 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.240
 pretty perfect is best appreciated 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.890
 that's what you swear in the cave 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.569
 get war because that's the way it is 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.179
 pretty much the only time that you 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.850
 game what gives everything else you have to 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.550
 work hard by rubbing that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.289
 there money from killed monsters lonely 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.020
 is around this then against example 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.039
 a little shield or other items 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.350
 exchange 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.690
 not even where you have to go will be here 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.430
 explains so one or the other 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.299
 younger gamer now pretty much the eyes 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.450
 rip 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.579
 because unlike skyrim or fable 3 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.480
 please no golden color directly in front of the 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.640
 eat 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.790
 I realize that I am here now 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.700
 represent that as a great thing and 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.130
 exciting but if I'm honest 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.690
 it is not always easy who will 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.480
 because, for example, think that under 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.859
 this bush is an old man who lives 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.450
 a little cash or money 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.340
 requires thereby be door bush 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.170
 The world is broken 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.829
 By the way, full of well hidden 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.750
 content 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.850
 There are, for example, secret dealers 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.220
 which items cheaper or exclusive 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.590
 some people even say that it is 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.900
 somewhere stronger swords should give 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.790
 But it's not just about zelda 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.250
 to research what you are looking for in products 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.040
 should have heard we are 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.019
 yes, even on a royal mission 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.850
 So we should also from time to time 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.890
 in a dungeon stop by the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.230
 however, the player should enter when entering 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.090
 be careful and thank you for that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.489
 is that, for example, that would be 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.770
 very unfavorable the fifth 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.290
 inadvertently enter before the first one 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.190
 and yes you heard right itself so 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.740
 what can happen 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.290
 In such a dungeon we have to do that 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.660
 or solve other puzzles and the one 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.790
 or other monster ass spanking one 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.870
 finally the respective final opponent 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.540
 to face 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.610
 the final opponents are especially later 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.530
 Do not level easy superman often 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.480
 Most tip from one of the old gentlemen 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.480
 which you happen to meet in the long 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.340
 me, of course, is often like that 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.510
 a certain item needs it 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.250
 the enemy can smell at all 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.440
 the items which one necessarily for 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.020
 To get there you will usually find one 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.640
 in the deepest corner of my life like that 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.740
 So you should be careful that you do not 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.240
 over looks no desire now determined 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.040
 At some point, thank you all again 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.950
 search because you're somewhere mine 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.260
 line have forgotten about 80 percent 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 However, the items are optional, the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.890
 I find pretty cool how easy so 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.960
 through power, for example, the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.060
 boomerang over here but not the see 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.620
 attentive player that stands 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.610
 but always extremely cool item 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.560
 Inventory pleased 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.120
 I think that will be attentive players 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.120
 These days, it's not just rewarding 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.900
 oh yes I have to again the bosses 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.370
 mention those are left after their death 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.570
 a big heart 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.390
 if you like the 1 you can not care 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.120
 if you get the heart then get it 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.950
 one more life 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.810
 then it goes off to a new room in 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.780
 which one of the eight hits later 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.580
 waiting for him you should you it 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.710
 However, do not think that the game 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.710
 after the lonely of all parts to the end 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.260
 would you have to go to one again ? 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.990
 final long of about half that size 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.900
 is like the whole world of the game and 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.650
 he is also diabolical who liberates there 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.540
 But then her too 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.490
 eponymous princess and then you have 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.050
 it must be good for you that I have to 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.700
 the difficulty again 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.350
 mention because so far I believe 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.240
 not so completely leaked that the 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.770
 players in spe have some problems 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.300
 because the game is from 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.570
 difficulty level really one 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.860
 chunk 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.840
 Lastly I should still the music 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.300
 mention the only consists of one 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.580
 few tricks but the princess is so deep in 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.950
 your higher underscore the atmosphere 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.900
 should 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.540
 the one shame she would not be too 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.090
 In conclusion, therefore, can be said 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.070
 be that his game is which 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.450
 actually one feels at hand 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.960
 really like being one 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.960
 Great wide world the only way he screams 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.070
 I could explore myself sometimes 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.900
 But then you are one 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.580
 little help wish that tells 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.280
 which Baumann can ignite or 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:54.080
 which can be as strict, the 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.000
 Dungeons are different from the ones 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.520
 do not puzzle so vehemently 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.770
 But this can be the construction of the opponents 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.530
 and the bosses easily make up for it 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:08.750
 All in all, I can be legend of 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.430
 zelda is known as a very good rider 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.700
 that was it with this review 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.760
 if you like a bit of mario 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.250
 to know myths or something else 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.050
 you did not know about the mario universe 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.130
 then just have a look 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.080
 video in the middle 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.510
 if you do not mind then do it 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.550
 do not stop and otherwise wish you 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.150
 Have a nice day until next time 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.150
