a Wednesday this is so that the samples

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700 
a Wednesday this is so that the samples
can<00:01:54.420> reach<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.810> lab<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.259> processed

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
can reach the lab and be processed

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
can reach the lab and be processed
before<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> weekend<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.180> also<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> try

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
before the weekend you also want to try

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
before the weekend you also want to try
and<00:01:57.930> sample<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> morning<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.130> mail

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and sample in the morning and then mail

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
and sample in the morning and then mail
or<00:01:59.579> deliver<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.000> samples<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.719> lab<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
or deliver the samples to the lab the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
or deliver the samples to the lab the
same<00:02:01.350> day<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> bacterial

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
same day this is because the bacterial

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.179 
same day this is because the bacterial
samples<00:02:03.930> are<00:02:04.049> only<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.920> over<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
samples are only good for just over a

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.199 
samples are only good for just over a
day<00:02:05.490> before<00:02:06.180> they're<00:02:06.299> no<00:02:06.420> longer<00:02:06.780> usable

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.369 

today<00:02:11.209> I'm<00:02:11.360> interested<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> quality<00:02:12.349> of

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
today I'm interested in the quality of

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.809 
today I'm interested in the quality of
the<00:02:12.500> water<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.890> I'm<00:02:13.010> drinking<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.730> I've

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
the water that I'm drinking so I've

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.900 
the water that I'm drinking so I've
selected<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.390> kitchen<00:02:14.750> faucet<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.410> sample

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
selected the kitchen faucet to sample

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.040 
selected the kitchen faucet to sample
ideally<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.030> want<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.269> faucet<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.900> has

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
ideally you want a faucet that has

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.690 
ideally you want a faucet that has
separate<00:02:18.470> controls<00:02:18.890> for<00:02:19.099> hot<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.430> cold<00:02:19.610> water

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
separate controls for hot and cold water

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.059 
separate controls for hot and cold water
and<00:02:20.180> doesn't<00:02:20.540> swivel<00:02:20.930> because<00:02:21.440> bacteria<00:02:21.680> can

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
and doesn't swivel because bacteria can

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.740 
and doesn't swivel because bacteria can
reside<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.610> cracks<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.150> those<00:02:23.269> controls

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
reside in the cracks and those controls

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.750 
reside in the cracks and those controls
and<00:02:23.959> give<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> false<00:02:24.470> positive<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:25.370> your

have<00:03:51.590> on<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.859> bottle<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.519> I'm<00:03:52.639> going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.790> use

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
have on the bottle and I'm going to use

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.330 
have on the bottle and I'm going to use
a<00:03:53.269> permanent<00:03:53.569> marker<00:03:53.810> or<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.530> pen<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:55.160> will

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
a permanent marker or a pen that will

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.430 
a permanent marker or a pen that will
not<00:03:55.549> wash<00:03:55.849> off<00:03:56.180> when<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.480> bottle<00:03:56.780> gets<00:03:56.959> wet

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
not wash off when the bottle gets wet

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.009 
not wash off when the bottle gets wet
now<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.340> line<00:03:58.519> is<00:03:58.670> flushed<00:03:59.000> I'm<00:03:59.840> going

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
now that the line is flushed I'm going

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.979 
now that the line is flushed I'm going
to<00:04:00.079> take<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.380> bacteria<00:04:00.859> sample<00:04:01.630> first<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.840> want

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
to take the bacteria sample first I want

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.240 
to take the bacteria sample first I want
to<00:04:03.019> turn<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.380> string<00:04:03.680> down<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.980> a

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
to turn the string down to a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.050 
to turn the string down to a
pencil-sized<00:04:05.530> stream<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.680> water<00:04:06.950> so<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:07.910> I

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
pencil-sized stream of water so that I

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.330 
pencil-sized stream of water so that I
can<00:04:08.239> easily<00:04:08.419> fill<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> bottle<00:04:09.290> now<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.069> will

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
can easily fill the bottle now I will

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.979 
can easily fill the bottle now I will
let<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.579> water<00:04:10.700> flow<00:04:10.849> again<00:04:11.389> for<00:04:11.720> three<00:04:11.900> to

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
let the water flow again for three to

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.559 
let the water flow again for three to
five<00:04:12.200> minutes<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.769> allow<00:04:13.459> any<00:04:13.700> bacteria<00:04:14.329> from

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
five minutes to allow any bacteria from

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.479 
five minutes to allow any bacteria from
adjusting<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.169> faucet<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.950> be<00:04:16.070> flushed<00:04:16.340> away

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
adjusting the faucet to be flushed away

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.759 
adjusting the faucet to be flushed away
there's<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.180> white<00:04:17.479> powder<00:04:17.959> in<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.409> bottle

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
there's a white powder in the bottle

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.469 
there's a white powder in the bottle
which<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.099> preservative<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:19.970> don't<00:04:20.269> want

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
which is a preservative so I don't want

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.030 
which is a preservative so I don't want
to<00:04:20.539> rinse<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.930> bottle

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040
