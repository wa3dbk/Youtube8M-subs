00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
approach for fall and you just simply

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.850 
approach for fall and you just simply
cross<00:05:04.410> it<00:05:04.620> around<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.919> back<00:05:05.180> just<00:05:06.440> one<00:05:07.440> into

two simple steps bring it around the
front<00:05:09.840> this<00:05:10.200> creates<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.590> nice<00:05:10.770> drape<00:05:11.070> look<00:05:11.490> on

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
it and play with it a little bit more

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.469

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
it's great to just add a layer if you're

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.580 
it's great to just add a layer if you're
out<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.970> it's<00:05:27.120> cold<00:05:27.390> especially<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.440> we're

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
out and it's cold especially as we're

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.440 
out and it's cold especially as we're
approaching<00:05:28.650> those<00:05:29.130> seasons<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.790> love<00:05:30.300> this

look<00:05:30.660> you<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.140> do<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.979> other<00:05:32.010> way<00:05:32.310> which

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
look you can do it the other way which

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.670 
look you can do it the other way which
is<00:05:32.820> traditional<00:05:33.390> if<00:05:33.540> it's<00:05:33.720> on<00:05:33.870> Ford<00:05:34.229> you<00:05:34.500> can

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
is traditional if it's on Ford you can

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.620 
is traditional if it's on Ford you can
just<00:05:34.890> tie<00:05:35.070> it<00:05:35.130> like<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.490> sash<00:05:35.790> to<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:36.150> side<00:05:36.360> too

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
just tie it like a sash to the side too

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.480 
just tie it like a sash to the side too
but<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.320> this<00:05:37.560> way<00:05:37.770> it's<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.190> little<00:05:38.340> bit

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
but I like this way it's a little bit

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.640 
but I like this way it's a little bit
more<00:05:38.700> edgy<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.990> don't<00:05:40.169> know<00:05:40.290> by<00:05:40.470> looking
