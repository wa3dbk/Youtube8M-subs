00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Music.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Jane Houston Jones: What's up for October.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A total lunar eclipse.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A partial solar eclipse.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And Mars meets a comet.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hello and welcome. I'm Jane Houston Jones from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Mars and Comet Siding Spring are moving closer to each other this month.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
On October 19, the comet and the planet pass within 81,000 miles of one another.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You may be able to spot the comet leading up to--and after--the 19th.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But from the U.S., you'll need an unobstructed view of the south-southwestern horizon just after sunset.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Try spotting Mars first. It's to the upper left of the orange star Antares,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
near the horizon at about 7:30 p.m. local time.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then, use your binoculars to scan for the comet.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Even through amateur telescopes, Comet Siding Spring may be just too faint to see.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Even if it's not visible at your location,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the comet will be visible to our missions currently at Mars.  And we hope to get back images.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Sound: Whoosh.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Jones: Set your alarm clock for an after-midnight wakeup on the morning of October 8.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The moon enters Earth's deep shadow for the second lunar eclipse of the year

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
at 2:15 a.m. on the west coast of North America. That's 5:15 on the east coast.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The total phase will begin at 3:15 a.m. on the west coast, or 6:15 on the east coast.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Sound: Whoosh.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Jones: Two weeks later, from North America, a partial solar eclipse will be visible in the late afternoon.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
On the east coast, the sun sets before the eclipse reaches its maximum,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but observers will see a dramatic partial eclipse.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The deepest eclipse, where the moon's silhouette extends nearly all the way across the sun,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
will be visible far to the north in the Canadian Arctic.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
On the west coast, the dark silhouette will cover about half the sun in the late afternoon.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The eclipse is not visible in Maine, Massachusetts or Rhode Island.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Remember: Never look directly at the sun during an eclipse--or any time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
