00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.800
 hello friends how about 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.080
 once the series of the 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.410
 elimination of the defending piece of 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.840
 other pieces we are going to start another new 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:21.780
 series this is about the weakness of 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.660
 the last row or the first row 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:31.119
 and it's about the elimination of 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:34.870
 defending pieces of this row that is already 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.000
 be the eighth row or the first 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.810
 row is worth 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 we have a position here 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.300
 in which we see what 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.870
 in this last row 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.870
 there is the white lady 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.030
 This horse f-8 stands for 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.670
 action 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.180
 what would happen to you how the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.620
 white 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 and a moment to think a little 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.170
 well the solution would be 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:23.860
 a spectacular old sacrifice worth 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.450
 Bone we see that here is diagonal 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.020
 abdominal at the end and the tower is worth 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020
 but 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.229
 It would not be a good tower or to overcome part 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.229
 here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.200
 checkmate because pawn would come by bishop 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.350
 and the white one has wasted a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.179
 golden opportunity then they would have 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.020
 to do white for what we have 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:57.149
 said a spectacular lady sacrifice 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:02.370
 here attracting the black king is worth now 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.830
 if they do not take white they already take 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.280
 a definite good benefit even if 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.280
 they go here 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.210
 they would take a lot of advantage because they already 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:22.970
 have eaten a horse and if the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:27.190
 Black take the lady as tower 8 comes 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 giving the king a checkmate 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.890
 we return to the position 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.520
 initial 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.790
 and we see that if White does not give 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.400
 account of this sacrifice 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.519
 spectacular sacrifice the black 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.290
 they have a resource to win the game 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.719
 clear here we see that the black have 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.860
 this bishop we see that he has in this tower 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:08.130
 and it would be simple 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.000
 tower by h 2 and the next movement 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.000
 It would be checkmate but of course 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.709
 the sacrifice is here with which no 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.860
 can the black afford to lose that 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.510
 movement because 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.530
 they lose a movement 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.250
 that checkmate occurs to already worth 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.640
 with which the black opts for a 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.030
 Lady sacrifice is worth today 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.390
 sacrifice of lady and sacrifice the lady 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.370
 here even if they have this bishop is what 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.760
 they try to sacrifice giving him a check 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.970
 kill a check here to the king in this 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.530
 diagonal the king can not move 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.010
 White is forced to capture 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.800
 capture the diagonal film because they are 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.490
 forced and that have gotten with this 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:13.600
 have managed to send black to 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:16.180
 this at the end of the action to 8 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.510
 and now the sacrifice of the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.690
 machine because they eat it and the tower does not 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.180
 can checkmate n8 because he is not 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.680
 decided by his bishop is worth with which 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.080
 the black have won the time that 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.080
 I needed to checkmate here 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.689
 until the end of this film has taken the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.389
 Lady 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:44.089
 has been diverted and now the black ones 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.129
 tower for h 2 and the next movement 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.069
 are lost do what they do now 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.099
 white blacks give a check 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.399
 mate here is worth or good to any 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.259
 play of the black checkmate to 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:01.599
 any move meant the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.599
 white checkmate blacks 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.090
