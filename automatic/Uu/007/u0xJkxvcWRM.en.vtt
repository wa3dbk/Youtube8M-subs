00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello first of all I'm recording with 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:11.550
 artificial light because it is night and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:14.280
 that looks horrible still and I like it 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.650
 very much mentioned in a video that about 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 my goals for this 2015 I want to take care 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 more my hair and that's why I decided not to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.990
 have less for a good time and I do not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 He dyed it since October of last year and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.740
 that was the same time I cut myself 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.070
 the hair with honey pie but the same 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 day in October and now I lost again 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.390
 the hair but I still do not dye 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.239
 but since I had the muddy because 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
 what follows me more as my instagram and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 others my long-time things know that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 I have done many things but less than 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 color in red purple melo 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.940
 then the time videos when I 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 of color the hair and I have it as 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 half fuchsia and I said the muddy in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.570
 the hair and that's why I had very hair 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.100
 of colorado in the part of the boards and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 when I did not say it in October instead it lasted 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 Fed up 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 the dark mode color but the tincture 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.080
 I was leaving then to arrive at a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.009
 point where I had hair like that a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 very ugly blonde also for those who do not 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.670
 They know when they have red hair 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 I do not know if blonde girls naturally 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 I think that if I am very sure of 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.240
 get red hair you get in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.220
 half greenish and it's nothing but nothing 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 attractive and this is more than anything like 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.039
 put the water with the water chlorine the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.080
 pool you do not live your factor of having a 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.670
 little but also not as well 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.110
 in detail the point that you put in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.659
 half greenish but in green hair 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 but it has as nuances of the two 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 kids out there that's why I wanted 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 not have my hair but I can 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.869
 ratify that color that I had I knew 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.360
 the same internet reaches this raw what 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.789
 which is a colored hair mask 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.789
 of the nature brand my life 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.450
 and he had found out that he was selling it in 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.450
 pharmacies 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.590
 and I do not know why it is that they saw the one of a 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.740
 little more security to buy it well 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.470
 I decided to go for it and I bought people 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.210
 which is brown hair because what 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.770
 that I was looking for was to qualify the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.720
 green color that I had in my hair and 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.300
 this brand has one has a color like this 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.640
 reddish medium that is the color that one 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.650
 you need to qualify the green if you know 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.420
 the theme of the chromatic rose theory 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.880
 of the colors but decide for the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 brown colors because I did not want me 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.160
 stay 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.630
 red also upload photos 1006 their 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880
 so many product purchases because 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.980
 I wanted to know the opinion of the people and 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.459
 He told them that it was good and that it served and 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.490
 all that, so I tried it and it worked 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.350
 he achieved the effect that I wanted he did not let me 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.640
 a color and a chestnut be 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.090
 dark but he finally managed to lose 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.280
 hair and I as well as happy and also that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.709
 later as well as more blonde 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.569
 the part as of the tips and point in 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.370
 reality like from here down but 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.560
 good and let's do some of this 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.860
 says he has henna extract and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.130
 wheat germ oil is removed from 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.820
 3 to 4 washes 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.370
 and in just five minutes the structure 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.620
 softens and brings the intense brightness of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.660
 chestnut color the henna holds a 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.030
 natural coloring its portalillo extract 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.660
 and strengthens the hair by reviving its 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.180
 colour 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.070
 Geometric oil rich in vitamin E 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.010
 restructures the hair and prevents 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.580
 dehydration disaster and brings 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.200
 flexibility and the tips of two 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.480
 ways to use it tells you that it puts it in 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.340
 the shower after the shampoo and the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.110
 conditioner you apply it what 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.600
 you leave five minutes and then you 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.840
 you retire but it tells you that it works better 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.270
 in dry hair and if I decided to try it 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.060
 of the two forms and hair I know how 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.980
 works two thousand thousand times better equal 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.930
 says you have to leave them 5 minutes 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.350
 I have never left it for 5 minutes 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.470
 I leave it more and I applied it and I'm going 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.930
 the house next to me my things my homework 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.870
 of hotels anything with long time 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.959
 the hair product because 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.790
 eating very little maybe it serves but 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.069
 I prefer to leave it longer so 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.530
 I could not tell you that the five minutes 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.090
 They are sufficient tersely that you 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.680
 It will help your hair have a lot more 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.310
 soft and all that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.509
 no it is not at least I do not leave it to me 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.990
 softer 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:32.259
 it does not hurt me that, but leaving as more 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.199
 healthy does not simply bring me the 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.330
 color theme and as mobile as 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.320
 Steer can not be seen but it remains 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 until here he occupies twice with the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.919
 dry hair and I think twice with the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.630
 wet hair and the adult but as they 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.199
 I say and I also know much better their 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.910
 prices is 4000 and something almost coming 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.099
 the 5,000 had forgotten to mention and 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.880
 good as this product I liked it and 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.220
 it worked for me 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.199
 I was so super extra I told you if I 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.360
 I would buy again completely but 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.460
 after a while I said I do not want 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.680
 only nuance the green color that 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.289
 it is to my hair I want you can be 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:17.009
 but I do not want to have me then I went 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.009
 by the same in black and purple tone 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:28.210
 success is achieved now I had my doubts 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.040
 but because just as I had it as 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.570
 pretty blond in some parts to 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.520
 the best could play with the purple ones and 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.200
 that I take a risk so kilos and not 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.540
 he did not leave it purple just in case 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.920
 previous product for brown hair 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.530
 I do not have a picture of a before and a 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.870
 but after this if the difference is 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.630
 very very notorious in fact I am a photo to 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.390
 my instagram that was very x so I a 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.180
 I took a picture of myself and they told me 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.550
 black hair that use black hair and 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.710
 I did not put on a mask with 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.930
 color what it is does not cover gray hair I 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.710
 I have the super powerful gray hair around here 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.570
 up and the first rule I tried to put 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.610
 let's see if it's nuanced they go a little bit I do not know 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.350
 It will be a little bit of color but we Mexican 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.630
 his super rebel even with tincture 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.390
 they are totally covered with that 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.210
 I say the whole subject of how long you 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:20.020
 lasts in the hair these says it lasts for 3 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.870
 two more days but I think it depends on 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.889
 hair and dyes because like hair 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.740
 I was just as blond as much more 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.330
 color then it took longer to leave the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.300
 fifth I 'm going to have hair that does not 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.550
 I have now dark but not be so 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.470
 blonde as before that I mean to continue 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.930
 good example die more in getting out 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.340
 all the color and this also fits me 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:49.930
 how are you there busy twice with 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.789
 dry hair and once with the shower 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.070
 but as I told him about the shower not 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.990
 It serves only says try it and has no 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.610
 to be but the hair is sectioned 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.009
 hair by parts I'm going to record it 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.560
 first I share them first with the 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.810
 bottom part very selecting and 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.940
 rolando melo with a bow and applying it 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.409
 strand by strand and then I go 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.860
 brushing the hair to 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:14.839
 that the product is fully expanded and 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.879
 where do you drive if I put it in the part of 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:19.069
 up because it 's like the part that most 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.719
 it feels more feels the bottom part 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.489
 I trained him to see so much with the part 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.929
 from above then the top part is 

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:26.899
 the one that matters to me the most 

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:30.589
 very intense the color and that the truth is 

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:32.360
 that in reviews I'm not the best staff 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:34.699
 I think we have to keep trying a 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.589
 little the subject Serbs if they have any 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:40.630
 doubt about the product that I speak and 

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:42.490
 I talk and I speak and it does not follow a pattern and I 

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.130
 I go everywhere and I could 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.480
 have gone some detail so leave it 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.690
 on the comments 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.640
 following on my twitter facebook e 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.300
 instagram you have to see be a little longer 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.300
 do not
