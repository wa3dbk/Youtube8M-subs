00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
surprise he showed that I think in his

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.749 
surprise he showed that I think in his
last<00:00:21.560> fight<00:00:21.829> in<00:00:21.919> Finland<00:00:22.340> which<00:00:22.430> air<00:00:22.640> was<00:00:22.730> a

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
last fight in Finland which air was a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.179 
last fight in Finland which air was a
terrible<00:00:23.210> just<00:00:23.390> terrible<00:00:23.630> decision<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.099> he

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
terrible just terrible decision and he

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.019 
terrible just terrible decision and he
showed<00:00:25.369> what<00:00:25.550> he's<00:00:25.640> capable<00:00:25.790> of<00:00:25.970> doing

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029

against<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.840> big<00:00:27.020> guy<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.259> I<00:00:27.439> think<00:00:27.470> he's<00:00:27.710> going

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
against a big guy and I think he's going

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.800 
against a big guy and I think he's going
to<00:00:28.040> be<00:00:28.130> more<00:00:28.279> motivated<00:00:28.520> now<00:00:28.970> that<00:00:29.689> he<00:00:29.779> knows

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
to be more motivated now that he knows

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.409
