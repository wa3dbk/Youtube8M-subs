by putting the hair in a ponytail it's
pretty<00:00:22.550> simple<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.589> then<00:00:24.589> you're<00:00:24.740> just<00:00:24.769> going

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189

to<00:00:25.429> split<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:26.060> ponytail<00:00:26.570> into<00:00:26.869> two<00:00:27.320> sections

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
to split the ponytail into two sections

hold on to while you work on the other

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.140 
hold on to while you work on the other
section<00:00:35.590> okay<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:36.650> go<00:00:37.040> ahead<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:37.370> divide<00:00:37.940> the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
section okay so go ahead and divide the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.790 
section okay so go ahead and divide the
section<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.630> you're<00:00:38.870> working<00:00:39.260> on<00:00:39.410> first

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
section that you're working on first

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.940 
section that you're working on first
into<00:00:40.580> three<00:00:41.030> different<00:00:41.210> strands<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.260> we're

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
into three different strands and we're

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.040 
into three different strands and we're
going<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.130> braid<00:00:43.460> this<00:00:43.880> section<00:00:44.480> it's<00:00:44.690> just<00:00:44.960> a

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
going to braid this section it's just a

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.440 
going to braid this section it's just a
simple<00:00:45.470> underhanded<00:00:46.220> braid<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:46.700> you're<00:00:47.330> not

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
simple underhanded braid if you're not

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.080 
simple underhanded braid if you're not
familiar<00:00:47.630> with<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.080> it's<00:00:48.590> where<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:49.640> pull

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
familiar with that it's where you pull

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.630 
familiar with that it's where you pull
your<00:00:50.390> right<00:00:50.780> strand<00:00:51.260> underneath<00:00:52.070> your<00:00:52.310> center

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
your right strand underneath your center

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.790 
your right strand underneath your center
strand<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.330> then<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.110> left<00:00:54.380> strand

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
strand and then the left strand

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.700 
strand and then the left strand
underneath<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:55.520> one<00:00:55.810> so<00:00:56.810> that<00:00:57.080> instead<00:00:57.440> of

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
underneath that one so that instead of

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.180 
underneath that one so that instead of
getting<00:00:58.130> a<00:00:59.140> v-shape<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.410> your<00:01:00.590> braid<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:00.980> kind

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
getting a v-shape in your braid you kind

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.430 
getting a v-shape in your braid you kind
of<00:01:01.250> get<00:01:01.400> an<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.820> shape<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.510> your<00:01:02.840> braid<00:01:03.079> if<00:01:03.260> that

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
of get an a shape and your braid if that

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.999 
of get an a shape and your braid if that
makes<00:01:03.710> sense<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.020> braiding<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.140> underhanded

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
makes sense and braiding it underhanded

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.420 
makes sense and braiding it underhanded
will<00:01:07.369> make<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.120> next<00:01:08.330> steps<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.260> lot<00:01:09.620> easier<00:01:09.890> if

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
will make the next steps a lot easier if

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.670 
will make the next steps a lot easier if
the<00:01:11.270> underhanded<00:01:11.780> braid<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.170> really<00:01:12.470> tricky

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
the underhanded braid is really tricky

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.470 
the underhanded braid is really tricky
for<00:01:12.980> you<00:01:13.070> though<00:01:13.250> go<00:01:13.670> ahead<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:13.940> do<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.360> over

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
for you though go ahead and do it over

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.780 
for you though go ahead and do it over
handed<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.260> I'm<00:01:15.590> sure<00:01:15.920> you'll<00:01:16.070> get<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.310> really

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
handed and I'm sure you'll get a really

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.040 
handed and I'm sure you'll get a really
great<00:01:16.940> look<00:01:17.210> still

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.480 

okay<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.800> finished<00:01:23.010> with<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
okay so when you are finished with that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.150 
okay so when you are finished with that
braid<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.420> tie<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.690> off<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.230> let<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:25.890> fall

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
braid you can tie it off and let it fall

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.890 
braid you can tie it off and let it fall
and<00:01:26.430> we're<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.120> get<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.510> section

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and we're going to get the other section

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
and we're going to get the other section
of<00:01:27.990> hair<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> exact<00:01:28.890> same<00:01:29.040> thing<00:01:29.490> on

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
side of the head you can even choose to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
side of the head you can even choose to
do<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.310> without<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.880> ponytail<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> top

do it without the ponytail at the top
and<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.410> start<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.100> separate<00:01:50.610> braids

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and just start the two separate braids

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.380 
and just start the two separate braids
and<00:01:51.120> combine<00:01:51.510> them<00:01:51.540> later<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.210> bit

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and combine them later it's a little bit

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
and combine them later it's a little bit
easier<00:01:54.870> with<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.260> little<00:01:55.740> girl<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.550> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
easier with a little girl to have the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
easier with a little girl to have the
ponytail<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.450> secure<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.020> top<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> braid

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
ponytail to secure the top of the braid

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.430 
ponytail to secure the top of the braid
but<00:01:59.370> that<00:01:59.610> is<00:02:00.200> totally<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:02.750> ok<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.810> when

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
but that is totally up to you ok so when

you can tie them together with an
additional<00:02:09.270> elastic<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.350> that's<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
additional elastic and that's going to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.330 
additional elastic and that's going to
allow<00:02:11.340> us<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.850> tug<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.990> our<00:02:13.200> fish<00:02:13.560> scales<00:02:14.010> a
