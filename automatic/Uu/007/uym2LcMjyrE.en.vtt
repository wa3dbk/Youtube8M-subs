00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.999 
friends who were out of state and my
parents<00:01:58.290> wouldn't<00:01:58.469> let<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.680> call<00:01:58.890> them

parents wouldn't let me call them

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.550

because<00:01:59.189> it'd<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.369> too<00:01:59.520> expensive<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.299> got

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
because it'd be too expensive so we got

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.660 
because it'd be too expensive so we got
in<00:02:01.560> some<00:02:01.770> Messenger<00:02:02.100> accounts<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.520> could

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
in some Messenger accounts so we could

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.800 
in some Messenger accounts so we could
talk<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.939> each<00:02:02.969> other<00:02:03.240> online

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
talk to each other online

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.899 
talk to each other online
and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> remember<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> college<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and I remember going to college and and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.730 
and I remember going to college and and
no<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.299> had<00:02:06.479> an<00:02:06.810> instant<00:02:07.110> messenger<00:02:07.409> account

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
no one had an instant messenger account

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.660 
no one had an instant messenger account
and<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:07.950> thought<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> coolest

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and they thought that was the coolest

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.020 
and they thought that was the coolest
thing<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.270> so

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
thing and so

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.090 
thing and so
