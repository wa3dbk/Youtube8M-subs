00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 how was the victims of 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.879
 superbikes the dotcom and in three the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.440
 episode number 14 the show is surpassed 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.210
 weekly where you our audience 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 they ask us questions and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.059
 obviously we answer them in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.059
 video so let's arm 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.840
 this video is sponsored by the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.619
 welfare dotcom cellular spots 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.000
 high range 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.289
 we go with the first one that makes a 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.539
 question that many did 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.340
 people in this case take the person 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.710
 the last realized that is called mariano 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.980
 rivera says that it is and especially and for 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.269
 What is the use of nfc is an initial ism whose 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.339
 translation in spanish is means 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.470
 communications from nearby fields and 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.750
 basically a method is a technology 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.519
 of very low data transmission 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.470
 power and it 's very short range that 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.909
 allows for example with a phone 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.710
 connected to a speaker simply 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.649
 supporting the phone in the area where 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.210
 I would be receiving the tambo of the nfc 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.129
 So for example I will enter 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.629
 with an example here we have an intern 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.820
 sony that also works with technology 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.559
 nfc we have a little symbol that tells us 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.720
 where we have to support the right in 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.039
 this case I have a nexus 5 so let's go 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.050
 to approach the camera we will see that 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.490
 the little symbol is there and we are going to support 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.770
 the phone we are going to obviously first 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.880
 turn on the speaker is on and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.380
 let's support the phone so 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.770
 listen very softly the sound that makes 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 when it connects 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.490
 there's the screen is actually the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.710
 music to pay for rights issues of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.179
 author but it's very simple basically not 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.649
 I miss you too much for that if I 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.810
 benefit that sells for other things 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.340
 also for example if we have a nfc in 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.799
 tablet why could I do it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 let's say a sticker that can be pasted 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.530
 let's say for example at the door of the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.079
 self we all approach 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.340
 We support the phone directly with 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.350
 we state this state for 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.689
 I told him to turn on the gps here I'm going 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.549
 easy and turn on m-13 basically for that 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.319
 is going to serve us we go with the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.720
 second coming from the gentleman in soft 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.849
 they plug that says it's the filter for 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.739
 works in a camera for what 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.929
 serves with this is a pretty question 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.090
 twitter techniques simplify the most 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.799
 possible the title we passed in a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.349
 camera for example let's talk about an adsl 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.970
 of networks a reflex camera will serve 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.039
 in order to eliminate what is called the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.319
 play effect is usually the mareny 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.599
 is given when you see details for example 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.579
 in cloth we have a shirt or a sack 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.319
 are details that exceed 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.450
 resolutions of the cameras what 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.890
 We are taking the photo or filming in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.490
 where the filter goes under basically 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.710
 It is made to eliminate 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.480
 what happens when dizziness is eliminated 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.760
 filter stockings we passed we lost a 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.260
 a little bit of detail then 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 lately some companies like canon 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.350
 and nikon been trying to line the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.450
 filter goes low and then do by 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.310
 software or in some other way the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.560
 elimination of that sea ​​is a very good 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.870
 question of the Lord nobody says that says 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.220
 since the node is almost inconceivable 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.890
 in argentina we are currently 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.510
 talking about what is 2014 pedrero that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.430
 others is cheap with android but 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.260
 generally recommended to people who 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.460
 asks me this question do I have to the sun 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.710
 imperial is a very good alternative 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.720
 obviously the price may differ but 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.030
 obviously it is quite at the same level 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.830
 of what is the engine or with those of others 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.840
 They say that in some cell phones 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.940
 Chinese origin the camera loses the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.860
 trace very easily the answer to 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.420
 this question is quite simple because 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.040
 a camera not only the part of the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.590
 hardware is not only the sensor 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.320
 but also a very, very, very 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.450
 important software and that's what 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.910
 fails in what a world is quite 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.740
 further back generally the phones of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.940
 Chinese provenance unfairly in the 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.440
 software then it is very likely that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.150
 that's why the camera can lose 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.130
 or that also informs us correctly 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.130
 or you can have other errors too 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:42.730
 I had one honestly to this day if 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:57.920
 I can tell you that when I was a pretty 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:04:00.170
 pretty as the blackberry does not work 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.270
 because there are those phones with both 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.770
 Android or with our iphone that I 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.330
 they could serve a little more we 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.160
 We took a jiffy to thank a 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.770
 montonazo to the people of game gamestop 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.900
 com.ar point that sponsored this video 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.030
 remember that they are importers of 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.410
 technology and it is very likely that the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.299
 most of the time they get the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.130
 phones much faster on your site 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.510
 web that in the operators here in 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.250
 Argentina so if they are super 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.690
 anxious can enter your website and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.610
 check if the phone is there 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.590
 they currently want in this they finish 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.409
 to get the samsung galaxy naut 3 the 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.529
 sony xperia z1 the htc guaminí 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:36.769
 xperia z ultra the iphone 5 s and also 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.809
 5 c the nexus 5 and the 2 axis and 

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:40.489
 finally the motor or the motorcycle ex by 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.199
 of course all phones released 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:43.819
 do not forget to follow them so much in your 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.529
 twitter as in your facebook for not 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.179
 get lost of any offer and new 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.699
 releases finally the last 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.749
 question comes from the Lord if they read this 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.229
 name is wrong 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:58.819
 marc as they say but ask us 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.919
 you believe in the nokia back mandy moore ya 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.809
 that would come to have androids situation 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.969
 It would be the first Nokia phone with 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:07.249
 android and to answer your questions 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.229
 honestly I will not believe in him until 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.119
 I see it finished or I can see a 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.449
 montonazo de renderos photos images 

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:16.339
 made with a Nokia tablet phone with 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.719
 a little arrow down running before what 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.550
 it opens up here nor did we see it until 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.229
 here is not official I can not believe in 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.849
 that's just a rumor of something so 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.789
 big as this is very complicated to 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.720
 believe this forecast number 14 has been 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.430
 obviously 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.780
 you can also tell me what you want in 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.250
 the comments also if it served you 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.650
 then share the video with someone else 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.480
 obviously I also asked you please 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.250
 that you subscribe to the channel that if also 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.140
 you can follow me and a cousin in 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.000
 twitter dominates super pixel on your twitter

 forum and finally should not happen 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.480
