00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.859
 the part are my friends and so on 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.559
 Welcome to the Sumo 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.150
 cross lifting already become a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.779
 week ago I'm in default with default 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.010
 the videos were provided 177 5 55 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.270
 but I did not like it now 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 still to pick individual slices 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.460
 that's why i said mom 180 and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 you see it all a bit 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.380
 controlled really pulled up 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 the muscles are concentrated 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.559
 now with the light weights 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.149
 I would like that for so long 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.899
 go get out that means here very much 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.300
 slowly 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.700
 for my relationships the positive 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 given very controlled and gone 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.059
 maybe you fall on the setup it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 otherwise I breathe down again now 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.489
 separately then to really hard 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 I'm experimenting with that now 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.690
 a little bit because until march april 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 the 150 plus stand 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 optimally , of course, 260 would be very 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 nice because then I would have the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 official six plate yes six play 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.939
 tick that would be optimal and of course 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.210
 great what have I heard there is new 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.439
 gaming channel at the start 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.240
 teyssen is so blatant about the hasseler 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.920
 now has a marketing in every video 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.939
 Put the money out of you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 to pull bag 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.950
 no who's up for gaming and such a thing 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 let's play shift and that's how I like it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.200
 I've been an old gamer since then 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.689
 Almost 14 years since ten years 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.540

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.970
 still happy and have me 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.009
 now a channel like this decided 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.930
 to open up a little longer exists 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.700
 I already had one but that before 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 get in there and we can 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.409
 to stop by and see what and what 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 there's a cross, so to speak, her mega 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.380
 on the other hand, the nipples are supple 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.380

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.700
 statement videos to the karl and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.220

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.520
 basic exercises and free- practice exercises 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 is this all in the planning of f 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.130
 is so many planning hessian many 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.630
 plan and many requested or must he 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.980
 but there were a lot of them 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.870
 have asked what's up with the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.100
 training plans has prospects because the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.980
 Things cost 20 euros 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.720
 the things are created individually 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.610
 yes that means he gets an excel 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.350
 table there you can then yours 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.510
 track progression and they will become the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.310
 it does not have to be created individually 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.090
 There must be no cycle 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.400
 training be 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.900

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.700
 what they want to have and then I see 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.530

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.180
