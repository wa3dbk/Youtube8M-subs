00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.559
 welcome for this new you turn 1-5 when it feels like so today 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 I teach you must create a chromeo effect she smiles 5 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.989
 finally to do this I chose the lashkar police attacked the police 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.749
 see of warcraft 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.849
 So it's a game that I like closed eyes at the same time 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.259
 % an increase of one year it allows to have a trace which is the medieval 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.800
 but I find that the general legislator has lots to do with the role 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.410
 fonts do not support each other 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 so I'll see the other way 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.350
 I'm doing fischer 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 new documents 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.130
 then one thousand two hundred and eighty years 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.480
 pixels 2 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.150
 width for a height 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.610
 2,520 jobs 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.590
 in resolution in this sense all 12 people make up this color mode 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.990
 talk about the eight tracks 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.680
 let yourself be assured before drinking and white as the default color if 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 this was the case you press the key was to initialize the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.410
 colors 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.280
 you choose a name so how prominent colors 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 you come to get the little pots of paint that was small degraded 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.630
 evoke the places 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.050
 then came to look for the title when you switch over to the color of 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.200
 foreground like the white board 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.720
 you come to get the police you want so - it's the police 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.660
 rare that I found on two temple offerings common point between typing in 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.130
 research kraftwerk 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 amd I type my text so at netapp and m 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.930
 ayrault not flanking 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.290
 stone the city% and that we call now will have one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.060
 to do this 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.550
 the rct decline of the eu is huge 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.640
 in the face of these practices, I'm not sure that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.850
 could interest us 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.090
 a little home 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.260
 it is true that it is cruel on the layer of the police ryan of forges 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 the police while filming that I'm exhausted the text 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.139
 I double click on the layer and we do not forge 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.239
 but adds that his father georges hostages set the depth to 1000% 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:18.109
 then I will choose the size that I want there it depends on your size of 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.239
 the police 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.399
 police me for example I put it on 21 pixels 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.759
 increase the time clar mode 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.999
 p just slightly for mode by the way a test in France and in 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.999
 England at 1 72% 79% per annum 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.590
 in poker 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.660
 a jubilant has invaded France that will starve us even on the space of 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.609
 two young Fulani of silence 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.919
 you come for wood made in Cairo 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.589
 for them know it from elsewhere 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.109
 you bust 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.109
 you increase while are expected 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.559
 I have my hand on 100% 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:57.679
 auxerre 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.869
 now I rely on the control of the game but inside the 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.569
 vignette of such as Iran forge I click inside ya postal workers 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.059
 bright year-olds who put themselves around simple monterrey 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.059
 everything inside these policemen is selected 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.929
 so here I have control these pickers control that does not copy them m 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.059
 % Geneva 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.759
 under the sunset tab 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.759
 I create a new calculation dropped against the fact that he means 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:24.639
 copy and paste 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.059
 control of selected plants montesquieu police minnesota 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.549
 have disappeared 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.499
 and here I am doing 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.789
 mitigation 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.049
 Boghossian 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.049
 you rule on three modules if what I'm clear 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.649
 schollen on the few days or some are not and we do not forge 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.289
 and there I make filters 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:46.719
 when we kill 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.289
 lighting 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:49.849
 then father of the child 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.849
 at the texture level and if you are head on a center 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.549
 so which alone ensures that corresponds to the layer on which 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.879
 nine and the Gaussian blur and everything matches and Roquefort I put 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.209
 thedan in a layer 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.339
 you set the relief on the gold 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.969
 the maximum 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.449
 and you do in Cairo 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.929
 so that's what we get 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.799
 now we're going to break a settings layer which is the doweik layer 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.609
 the agent runs out of money 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.889
 Coupe de France Their precise cellar master 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.419
 and here I want to create a low point at the top 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.419
 I take another blank check to take a position 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.749
 like that so proud 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:32.729
 well we can see that the neurons that the exact place but many 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.520
 too pronounced 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.300
 so I come back to his misfortune and that oath 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.159
 I want to increase its opacity 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.159
 bcsa taillan 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.220
 so 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.919
 that its extent 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.919
 if I went to see 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.449
 here is its opacity here 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.150
 especially that badly 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
 ok to validate 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.520
 I want to give 100% 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.550
 I'm going a little bit above which song contest 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.089
 a mask of the arranged 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.089
 a settings calculation which is the level 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.680
 I want to play on the organ 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.839
 the middle arrow that represents at least the times 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.309
 the average time between 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:24.259
 I was auerre 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.639
 schollen will be a forge the few texts that were used and suddenly 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.819
 there are all the effects of double sushi clicks on 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.819
 and there I make other stations of the year 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.029
 and I'm doing 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.589
 so here you have learned to listen to a pack effect the lot 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.770
 rejoin 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.200
 a text font we must not be afraid I hope this tutto dante 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.530
 return to dance on photoshop the toys they have a next number 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.639
 on the same fixed network not like my job at all
