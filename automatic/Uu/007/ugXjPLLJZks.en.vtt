doing<00:03:10.329> anything<00:03:10.660> isn't<00:03:11.500> true<00:03:11.920> at<00:03:12.040> all<00:03:12.250> valve

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
doing anything isn't true at all valve

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.949 
doing anything isn't true at all valve
hasn't<00:03:13.000> really<00:03:13.150> been<00:03:13.269> doing<00:03:13.540> anything<00:03:13.720> in

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
hasn't really been doing anything in

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.789 
hasn't really been doing anything in
terms<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.319> new<00:03:14.530> games<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.790> we<00:03:16.090> know<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:17.109> yet

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
terms of new games that we know of yet

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.800 
terms of new games that we know of yet
but<00:03:18.459> we<00:03:18.609> do<00:03:18.790> know<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.180> lot<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.480> software

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
but we do know that a lot of software

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.449 
but we do know that a lot of software
and<00:03:19.959> hardware<00:03:20.019> work<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.739> being<00:03:20.920> done<00:03:21.010> within

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
and hardware work is being done within

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.340 
and hardware work is being done within
valve<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.299> able<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.630> revolutionize<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
valve to be able to revolutionize the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.440 
valve to be able to revolutionize the
video<00:03:23.739> game<00:03:24.040> marketplace<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.239> very

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
video game marketplace so it is very

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.670 
video game marketplace so it is very
possible<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.959> when<00:03:26.170> all<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.530> these

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
possible that when all of these

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.080 
possible that when all of these
different<00:03:27.069> things<00:03:27.100> are<00:03:27.400> finally<00:03:27.850> fully

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
different things are finally fully

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.030 
different things are finally fully
implemented<00:03:28.720> in<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.079> way<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.440> Valve<00:03:29.620> wants

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
implemented in the way that Valve wants

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.160 
implemented in the way that Valve wants
them<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.340> be<00:03:30.370> all<00:03:30.970> these<00:03:31.299> other<00:03:31.510> unannounced

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
them to be all these other unannounced

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.349 
them to be all these other unannounced
valve<00:03:32.590> projects<00:03:33.250> will<00:03:33.459> finally<00:03:33.910> have<00:03:34.090> the

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
valve projects will finally have the

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.390 
valve projects will finally have the
grounds<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:34.989> able<00:03:35.139> to<00:03:35.380> be<00:03:35.560> released<00:03:35.769> what

ever<00:04:26.190> within<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.060> list<00:04:27.420> was<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> couple<00:04:28.110> of

ever within this list was a couple of

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.810 
ever within this list was a couple of
games<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.800> pretty<00:04:29.100> much<00:04:29.190> know<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.640> being

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
games that we pretty much know is being

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.520 
games that we pretty much know is being
worked<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.270> but<00:04:30.570> further<00:04:30.930> confirms<00:04:31.320> its

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
worked on but further confirms its

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.590 
worked on but further confirms its
developments<00:04:32.100> especially<00:04:32.270> left<00:04:33.270> 4<00:04:33.420> dead<00:04:33.570> 3

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
developments especially left 4 dead 3

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.290 
developments especially left 4 dead 3
the<00:04:34.200> next<00:04:34.770> left<00:04:34.920> 4<00:04:35.100> dead<00:04:35.220> game<00:04:35.490> seems<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:36.090> it

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the next left 4 dead game seems like it

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.450 
the next left 4 dead game seems like it
will<00:04:36.450> be<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.630> next<00:04:36.990> valve<00:04:37.320> game<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.220> left

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
will be the next valve game and the left

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.910 
will be the next valve game and the left
4<00:04:38.670> dead<00:04:38.910> segments<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:40.050> list<00:04:40.410> are<00:04:40.680> the

4 dead segments of this list are the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
very good look into what valve was doing

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
had one group within this list but so

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.450 
had one group within this list but so
did<00:05:03.450> f-stop<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.080> stars<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.860> blood<00:05:05.190> and

at<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.700> current<00:05:12.000> time<00:05:12.180> probably<00:05:12.780> has<00:05:13.140> to<00:05:13.260> do

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
at the current time probably has to do

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.440 
at the current time probably has to do
with<00:05:13.470> one<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.010> things<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.820> list<00:05:15.090> or

with one of the things in this list or
multiple<00:05:16.170> things<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.710> very<00:05:16.740> possible<00:05:17.100> that

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
multiple things it is very possible that

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.380 
multiple things it is very possible that
what<00:05:17.550> they're<00:05:17.670> working<00:05:17.790> on<00:05:18.000> behind<00:05:18.300> the

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
what they're working on behind the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.090 
what they're working on behind the
scenes<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.840> next<00:05:19.050> half-life<00:05:19.350> game<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:19.800> is

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
scenes is the next half-life game it is

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.770 
scenes is the next half-life game it is
very<00:05:20.430> likely<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:20.940> it's<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> next<00:05:21.480> left4dead

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
very likely that it's the next left4dead

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.780 
very likely that it's the next left4dead
game<00:05:22.170> and<00:05:22.410> it's<00:05:22.740> also<00:05:22.920> very<00:05:23.040> possible<00:05:23.670> that

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
game and it's also very possible that

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.760 
game and it's also very possible that
it's<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:23.970> game<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:24.360> we<00:05:24.480> don't<00:05:24.870> know<00:05:25.200> about<00:05:25.410> yet

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
it's a game that we don't know about yet

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.680 
it's a game that we don't know about yet
like<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.040> new<00:05:26.280> IP<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:27.030> could<00:05:27.180> very<00:05:27.360> much<00:05:27.420> show
