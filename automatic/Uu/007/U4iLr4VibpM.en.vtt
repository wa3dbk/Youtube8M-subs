00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.690 
down right why of course we're playing
on<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> super<00:00:35.579> nintendo<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.540> actual<00:00:36.989> game<00:00:37.430> so

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.860 

yeah<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.540> it'd<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.660> like

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
yeah so we don't know what it'd be like

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.790 
yeah so we don't know what it'd be like
on<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.350> emulator<00:00:45.230> heck<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.500> even<00:00:46.559> know

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on an emulator heck we don't even know

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.819 
on an emulator heck we don't even know
if<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.370> emulator<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.090> own<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:49.649> most

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
if it's on the emulator we own it most

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.060 
if it's on the emulator we own it most
likely<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.360> just<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> same<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> one

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
likely is just not the same we have one

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
likely is just not the same we have one
thing<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> noticed<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:54.120> emulator<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.899> can

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
this bus I wondered now back in at full

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.930 
this bus I wondered now back in at full
health<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.590> won't<00:02:44.770> work<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:47.520> know<00:02:49.650> when<00:02:50.650> we

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
health so it won't work I know when we

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420 
health so it won't work I know when we
record<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> head<00:02:52.510> oaken<00:02:52.750> videos

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.260 
record this on the head oaken videos
let's<00:02:54.430> test<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:57.460> pretty<00:02:57.790> much<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.000> get

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
let's test that and pretty much you get

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.150 
let's test that and pretty much you get
your<00:02:58.390> health<00:02:58.690> beat<00:02:59.050> down<00:02:59.350> while<00:02:59.980> you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
your health beat down while you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.040 
your health beat down while you

there's<00:05:15.030> something<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.980> so<00:05:16.980> there

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
there's something like that so there

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.650 
there's something like that so there
actually<00:05:17.550> is<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.880> little<00:05:18.120> bit<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.330> different

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
actually is a little bit of a different

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.360 
actually is a little bit of a different
twist<00:05:18.900> if<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.530> don't<00:05:19.860> go<00:05:19.980> for<00:05:20.160> one<00:05:20.280> hundred

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
twist if you don't go for one hundred

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.490 
twist if you don't go for one hundred
percent<00:05:20.550> earlier<00:05:21.150> in<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.360> game<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.810> this

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
percent earlier in the game and this

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.060 
percent earlier in the game and this
parts<00:05:25.830> a<00:05:25.919> little<00:05:25.950> bit<00:05:26.280> cheesy<00:05:26.700> but<00:05:28.070> boingy
