breathing<00:02:00.669> because<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.389> looks<00:02:01.569> so<00:02:01.659> foolish

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.169 
breathing because it looks so foolish

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.570 
learning or not just to play that thing
I<00:02:07.450> thought<00:02:08.080> too<00:02:08.380> much<00:02:08.410> trouble<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.099> I<00:02:09.250> learned

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.699 
I thought too much trouble so I learned
this<00:02:09.789> little<00:02:10.060> trick<00:02:10.239> of<00:02:11.050> bouncing<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
this little trick of bouncing the

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.030 
this little trick of bouncing the
staccato<00:02:12.130> off<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.940> breath<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.890> go

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
staccato off the breath so you can go

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.800 
staccato off the breath so you can go
for<00:02:15.280> hours<00:02:15.459> doing<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.270> learned<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
for hours doing it so then I learned the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.809 
for hours doing it so then I learned the
breathing<00:02:20.230> actually<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.580> learned<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.330> from<00:02:22.360> my

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819
