of ways you can store it but this is the
way<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.769> enjoy<00:00:26.340> doing<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.970> fabric<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.689> actually

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
way I enjoy doing my fabric I actually

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740 
way I enjoy doing my fabric I actually
fold<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.369> they're<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.640> same<00:00:30.179> width

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
fold them so that they're the same width

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.500 
fold them so that they're the same width
all<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.980> way<00:00:32.099> along<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.059> actually

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
all the way along and they will actually

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.950 
all the way along and they will actually
sit<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.469> shelf<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.010> way<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.489> keep<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.660> all

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
sit on my shelf that way I keep them all

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
sit on my shelf that way I keep them all
in<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.530> same<00:00:37.829> package<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> fabric

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
in the same package this is the fabric

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.240 
in the same package this is the fabric
I'm<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> need<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.950> project

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
I'm going to need for this one project

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.510 
I'm going to need for this one project
as<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> matter<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> fact<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.920> actually

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
as a matter of fact in here I actually

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.290 
as a matter of fact in here I actually
have<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> pattern<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.649> together

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
have the pattern so it's all together

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.639 
have the pattern so it's all together
how<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.840> bundle<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.440> like

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
how do I get the bundle to look like

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.939 
how do I get the bundle to look like
this<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:50.850> easy<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
this it's really easy you can do this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.840 
this it's really easy you can do this
with<00:00:53.129> any<00:00:53.399> size<00:00:53.489> fabric<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.550> takes

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
with any size fabric and it all takes

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.510 
with any size fabric and it all takes
one<00:00:57.180> ruler<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> need<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> decide<00:00:58.920> first<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
one ruler so you need to decide first of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
one ruler so you need to decide first of
all<00:00:59.640> what<00:01:00.030> size<00:01:00.329> ruler<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> use

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
all what size ruler are you going to use

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.969 
all what size ruler are you going to use
I<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> long<00:01:03.390> rollers<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> six

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
I like the long rollers I like a six

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
I like the long rollers I like a six
inch<00:01:05.189> ruler<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:06.990> equals<00:01:07.200> up

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
inch ruler because it actually equals up

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
inch ruler because it actually equals up
properly<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.430> shelf<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.150> could<00:01:09.330> use<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> six

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
properly in my shelf you could use a six

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.760 
properly in my shelf you could use a six
and<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> half<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> 6<00:01:11.790> by<00:01:12.030> 24<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.960> have

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and a half so this is a 6 by 24 I have

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
and a half so this is a 6 by 24 I have
my<00:01:13.890> folded<00:01:14.340> edge<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.450> cut<00:01:15.750> edge<00:01:15.960> here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
my folded edge here and my cut edge here

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
my folded edge here and my cut edge here
and<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.460> take<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> ruler<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and I'm just going to take the ruler and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.789 
and I'm just going to take the ruler and
I'm<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.930> place<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.350> top<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> my

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I'm going to place it on top of my

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.340 
I'm going to place it on top of my
fabric<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:21.479> am<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.110> just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
fabric and I am going to actually just

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.859 
fabric and I am going to actually just
roll<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:24.420> fabric<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> ruler<00:01:27.330> take

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
roll this fabric with the ruler take

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.819 
roll this fabric with the ruler take
your<00:01:28.049> roller<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.610> fold<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.150> half<00:01:30.829> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
your roller out and fold it in half so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.410 
your roller out and fold it in half so
then<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> next<00:01:33.180> piece

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
then I will do that to the next piece

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.230 
then I will do that to the next piece
and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.380> continually<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.790> with

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and I will continually to do that with

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.170 
and I will continually to do that with
all<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> pieces<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.140> fabric<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.880> even<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
all the pieces of fabric I have even the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.539 
all the pieces of fabric I have even the
long<00:01:39.420> ones<00:01:41.060> I'm<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> put<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:43.549> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
long ones I'm going to put it here and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.539 
long ones I'm going to put it here and
if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.149> hold<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.009> start<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
if you just hold it here as you start to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
if you just hold it here as you start to
turn<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.060> away<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.899> only<00:01:49.049> need<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> hold<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
turn right away you only need to hold it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
turn right away you only need to hold it
once<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.340> after<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.450> easy

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
once not after that it's very easy

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
once not after that it's very easy
you're<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.079> gonna<00:01:52.380> flip<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> ruler<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you're just gonna flip the ruler and I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're just gonna flip the ruler and I
come<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.909> end<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.140> fold<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
come to the end and I like to fold it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
come to the end and I like to fold it
where<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> edge<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.460> here<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.840> keeps

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
where the edge is here so it just keeps

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.399 
where the edge is here so it just keeps
the<00:02:01.259> edges<00:02:01.619> tucked<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.479> now

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the edges tucked in and I do this now

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.929 
the edges tucked in and I do this now
I'm<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
I'm going to do that with all of this

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
I'm going to do that with all of this
fabric<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.350> will<00:02:07.530> probably<00:02:08.129> tie<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
fabric and then I will probably tie it

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.490 
fabric and then I will probably tie it
together<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.539> tie<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.810> together<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
together I could tie it together with a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.999 
together I could tie it together with a
piece<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
piece of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.149 
piece of
even<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.580> shoelace<00:02:12.439> whatever<00:02:13.439> you<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.890> and

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
even a shoelace whatever you can and

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.850 
even a shoelace whatever you can and
then<00:02:14.489> I'll<00:02:14.640> put<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.819> pattern<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.599> this

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
then I'll put the pattern in with this

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
then I'll put the pattern in with this
so<00:02:16.860> having<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.640> all<00:02:17.790> bundled<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.659> has

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so having it all bundled like this has

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.199 
so having it all bundled like this has
Tennessee<00:02:19.799> for<00:02:20.010> me<00:02:20.099> not<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.430> steal<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> fabric

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
Tennessee for me not to steal the fabric

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.880 
Tennessee for me not to steal the fabric
from<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.629> project<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.290> go<00:02:22.439> with<00:02:22.650> another

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
from this project to go with another

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.369 
from this project to go with another
project<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> do<00:02:23.939> get<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.930> know

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
project so when I do get to it I know

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.890 
project so when I do get to it I know
that<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.099> fabric<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.150> even<00:02:27.540> do

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that all the fabric is there I even do

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.899 
that all the fabric is there I even do
the<00:02:28.049> same<00:02:28.290> thing<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.739> my<00:02:28.890> backing<00:02:29.430> fabrics

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
the same thing with my backing fabrics

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.210 
the same thing with my backing fabrics
and<00:02:30.090> even<00:02:30.269> fabrics<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:31.170> go<00:02:31.530> with

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and even fabrics that don't go with

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.089 
and even fabrics that don't go with
other<00:02:32.489> projects<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.470> sometimes<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
other projects just because sometimes I

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.860 
other projects just because sometimes I
find<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.459> fabric<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
find a fabric and I have to have it and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.920 
find a fabric and I have to have it and
it<00:02:36.959> doesn't<00:02:37.590> go<00:02:38.190> with<00:02:38.370> anything<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:39.150> it'll<00:02:39.810> go

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
it doesn't go with anything but it'll go

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
it doesn't go with anything but it'll go
with<00:02:40.109> my<00:02:40.290> stash<00:02:40.620> now<00:02:41.010> these<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.849> three<00:02:42.000> fast

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
with my stash now these are three fast

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.140 
with my stash now these are three fast
stacks<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.560> fabric<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.849> I'm<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
stacks of fabric here and I'm going to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.660 
stacks of fabric here and I'm going to
have<00:02:45.299> four<00:02:45.540> backs<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.010> it's<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.370> lot

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
have four backs and they are it's a lot

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.780 
have four backs and they are it's a lot
of<00:02:47.700> fabric<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.349> see<00:02:49.409> I<00:02:49.980> still<00:02:50.549> use

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
of fabric but as you can see I still use

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.520 
of fabric but as you can see I still use
the<00:02:50.819> same<00:02:51.239> method<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.190> they<00:02:53.190> will<00:02:53.400> all<00:02:53.639> fit<00:02:54.120> on

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the same method and they will all fit on

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.920 
the same method and they will all fit on
my<00:02:55.530> shelf<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.220> by<00:02:57.060> doing<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.629> can

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
my shelf and by doing this you can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.430 
my shelf and by doing this you can
actually<00:02:58.109> see<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.920> colors<00:02:59.310> at<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> glance<00:03:00.599> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
actually see the colors at a glance so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.319 
actually see the colors at a glance so
even<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:01.829> you<00:03:01.950> didn't<00:03:02.430> want<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.030> with

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
even if you didn't want to do this with

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.270 
even if you didn't want to do this with
all<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.599> your<00:03:03.900> patterns<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.129> you're

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
all of your patterns that are you're

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.729 
all of your patterns that are you're
going<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.730> keep<00:03:05.909> together<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.659> do<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.680> my

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
going to keep together I do this in my

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.979 
going to keep together I do this in my
colors<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:09.060> I'll<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.420> whole<00:03:09.659> stack<00:03:09.959> of

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
colors so I'll have a whole stack of

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.020 
colors so I'll have a whole stack of
purples<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.799> I'll<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.250> whole<00:03:11.400> stack<00:03:11.790> of

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
purples and I'll have the whole stack of

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.449 
purples and I'll have the whole stack of
reds<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:13.200> way<00:03:13.379> I'm<00:03:13.560> able<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.889> see<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
reds and that way I'm able to see at a

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.050 
reds and that way I'm able to see at a
glance<00:03:14.730> what<00:03:15.359> fabric<00:03:15.629> I<00:03:16.049> do<00:03:16.169> have<00:03:16.669> it's<00:03:17.669> just<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
glance what fabric I do have it's just a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.270 
glance what fabric I do have it's just a
different<00:03:18.419> idea<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.810> storing<00:03:19.349> your<00:03:19.530> fabric<00:03:20.129> I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
different idea of storing your fabric I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.339 
different idea of storing your fabric I
like<00:03:20.579> them<00:03:20.790> because<00:03:20.940> they<00:03:21.299> fit<00:03:21.540> perfectly<00:03:22.049> all

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
like them because they fit perfectly all

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.430 
like them because they fit perfectly all
on<00:03:22.560> my<00:03:22.769> shelf<00:03:23.099> just<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> thought<00:03:24.329> if<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.230> want

on my shelf just a thought if you want
to<00:03:25.530> give<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> try<00:03:26.010> let<00:03:26.579> me<00:03:26.609> know<00:03:26.730> what<00:03:26.970> you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
to give it a try let me know what you

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.689 
to give it a try let me know what you
