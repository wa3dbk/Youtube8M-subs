00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:40.190
 today's meeting yes finally 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.690
 Optimized again and it continues when 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.170
 again on the way in the meadow 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.659
 ever since I am very small 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.289
 At that time, I only searched the area 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:55.039
 and I found two coins right away 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.109
 new 10 cents then something from the 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.879
 third Reich 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.300
 Today I am back early 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.870
 in the morning and what do I find that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.990
 vehicle is fun 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:14.810
 whether this is focused on any case 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.360
 and schÃ¶nthaler suddenly sounds very much 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.880
 After silver now, skill is half 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.290
 hour and says again I have to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:28.970
 knew the elise gave it a lot 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.050
 I was right , okay 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.050
 on we go 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.970
 beautiful old belt buckle next 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.250
 hit again a nice coin three 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 I've never been able to read fan 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.380
 but I would then after a few and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.850
 look that one regrets everything clearly 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.850
 Today it's fun 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.440
 next fund so a funny role 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.750
 pretty hard 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.800
 no idea what that's one 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.869
 control or something is not 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.570
 idea 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.740
 You can tell him what it is 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:18.520
 maybe i have no idea and ok only 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.520
 a few meters further 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.750
 10 is enough if I continue very well 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.600
 On the way today we are just scraping 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.760
 found cartridges and such and I would have 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.820
 not thought 10 cent interesting good 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.860
 drive 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.050
 after a short break 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.650
 I've found yet 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.700
 found 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.700
 nice and small 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:03:01.220
 well, something new 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.220
 ok Hokage signal would have to be exposed 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
 there 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.900
 oh yes wonderful again more old coin 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.770
 one that runs so great today looks through 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.770
 the nice thing 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.970
 nice to see nothing but very thin 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 how the sound is 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.410
 sounds very much holds 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.050
 maybe silver coin maybe something 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.580
 other but wonderful class hey that 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.930
 OK, I'm fine today 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:58.380
 Let's go right away and 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:01.200
 next hit a small lead ball 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.930
 lead bullet probably behaving 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.930
 coal okay, go on 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.760

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.220
 musket ball but that is still up 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.430
 she probably does not trust properly 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.430
 cast 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:31.310
