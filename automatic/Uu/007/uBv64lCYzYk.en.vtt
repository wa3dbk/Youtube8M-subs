00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
wires on found the tech sensor and hot

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.730 
wires on found the tech sensor and hot
wire<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.020> then<00:01:36.020> grounded<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.620> to<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:38.740> right

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
wire and then grounded it to you right

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.060 
wire and then grounded it to you right
there<00:01:41.440> grounded<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.560> there<00:01:44.620> so<00:01:45.620> now<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:45.890> just

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
there grounded it there so now I just

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.930 
there grounded it there so now I just
got<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.550> clean<00:01:46.760> everything<00:01:47.030> up<00:01:48.370> and<00:01:49.370> sort<00:01:49.820> of

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
got to clean everything up and sort of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.760 
got to clean everything up and sort of
program<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:56.110> count<00:01:57.110> some<00:01:57.350> five<00:01:57.560> four<00:01:57.740> three

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
program it count some five four three

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.980 
program it count some five four three
two<00:01:58.040> one<00:01:58.960> works<00:02:01.870> okay<00:02:02.870> we'll<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.740> back
