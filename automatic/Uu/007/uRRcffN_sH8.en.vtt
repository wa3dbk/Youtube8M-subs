and<00:01:16.290> people<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.950> being<00:01:17.189> allowed<00:01:17.369> them

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and people are not being allowed them

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760

and<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.570> fact<00:01:18.600> fear<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and there is in fact fear that there is

area as well so we will have to wait

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
area as well so we will have to wait
perhaps<00:01:24.210> even<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.990> few<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.409> days<00:01:25.650> before<00:01:26.100> we
