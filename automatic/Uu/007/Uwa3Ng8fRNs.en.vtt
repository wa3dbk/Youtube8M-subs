00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.660
 excellent brian pass lawful all the

 chicken slapping the ball for bryant 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.940

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.100
 Left handed for Paolo Suarez is coming 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.680
 in the barrier and without back coast that 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.560
 is to read are also these the two for 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.660
 hit 999 it will be read what you are looking for 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.970
 the arch or the crossbar of every four of 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.060
 Kills figurine of a fault for 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.940
 he raised his arms said Juan Carlos 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:23.510
 war your dreams now is 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:26.330
 and more if he retired is yellow and he threw himself 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.040
 of hamar and so it comes out as poncio 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.670
 Piles the referee does not take the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.150
 card does not mark the repetition is 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.150
 hard 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.090
 but if you are giving the indicated that 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 threw then yes it would be reprimand the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.080
 center that comes to mark the value 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.540
 which carries with 35 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 for nobody is going back long is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.430
 arriving frame a psalm the recipe here 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.480
 is 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.480

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.860
 because you will like it 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.410

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.020
 walls that you have left now back to 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.360
 the line will touch on the laying 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.370
 Now for the header, they prefer now 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.700

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.700

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.110
 stick says no for the second 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.080

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.099
 and he hits the tube 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.610
 will leave it inside the area can be 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.950

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.750
 clearer the previous look at the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.530
 put that transition there and that's why all 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.040
