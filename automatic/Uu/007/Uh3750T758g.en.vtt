the 80s I thought it was a cool uniform
I<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.000> splish<00:02:06.720> has<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> big<00:02:07.320> belly<00:02:07.710> and

I if you know splish has a big belly and

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.609 
I if you know splish has a big belly and
it<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.850> ventilates<00:02:09.180> better<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.020> being

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it just it ventilates better and being

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
it just it ventilates better and being
outside<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.010> thought<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.490> got<00:02:11.640> more<00:02:11.880> errand

and stuff like that neither one smelled
good<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.590> think<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:18.330> the

wasn't as bad but you know that's kind
of<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.660> thing<00:02:24.720> they<00:02:25.020> do<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.770> used

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
of the thing they do that you get used

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.350 
of the thing they do that you get used
to<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> pretty<00:02:26.430> quick<00:02:26.700> though<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:26.940> mean<00:02:27.240> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
to a pretty quick though I mean it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.200 
to a pretty quick though I mean it
wasn't<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.800> know<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.980> definitely<00:02:29.370> notice<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
wasn't you know you definitely notice it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.700 
wasn't you know you definitely notice it
and<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.720> kind<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:30.990> get<00:02:31.110> used<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
and then you kind of get used to it I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.740 
and then you kind of get used to it I
thought<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.580> thought<00:02:33.240> there<00:02:33.570> was<00:02:33.720> more

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
thought and I thought there was more

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.020 
thought and I thought there was more
