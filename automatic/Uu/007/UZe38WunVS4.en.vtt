them<00:00:34.640> tough<00:00:35.059> that's<00:00:35.769> not<00:00:36.769> just<00:00:37.010> lost

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
them tough that's not just lost

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.090 
them tough that's not just lost
everybody<00:00:37.609> they<00:00:38.359> score<00:00:38.690> they<00:00:39.649> put<00:00:39.859> pressure

everybody they score they put pressure

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.709 
everybody they score they put pressure
on<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.399> defensively<00:00:40.850> pick-and-rolls<00:00:41.539> they

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
on you defensively pick-and-rolls they

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.599 
on you defensively pick-and-rolls they
get<00:00:41.899> to<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.109> line<00:00:42.289> they<00:00:43.039> push<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.460> basketball

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609

so<00:00:44.120> that's<00:00:44.300> up<00:00:44.480> put<00:00:45.019> a<00:00:45.050> demand<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.530> your

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
so that's up put a demand on your

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.450 
so that's up put a demand on your
defense<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:48.559> I<00:00:48.649> think<00:00:48.710> that's<00:00:49.070> not<00:00:49.249> just

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
defense and I think that's not just

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.700
