00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.910
 motor ok so here we will make the match 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.710
 of challenge so end med not want to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 combat sport does not martial art 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 step people officially so at this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 what we want to see is in relation to him 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.960
 at its centering already that's what's going 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.200
 feel in the east that has never done 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.150
 specific hitting in his life me this 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.590
 that I will also feel when he gets 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.160
 center to see if I change something 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.480
 different and a little see the girls 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.980
 bacon with someone who is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 completely neutral with respect to this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.650
 accord percussion system which one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 kill flies or the 107 centers is ok 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.010
 now you're going to shoot me by being 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.330
 to train there we still have a good 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.519
 different impact these crowds 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 you start again shoot center and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.090
 center-east it's crazy that it does not penetrate 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.270
 not what do you feel when 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 uppercut the power is not the same 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.000
 do not seem the same power see you 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 sense that you have more power on this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.860
 that's right, that's it the game is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 the point we need he goes 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 easily he backs away from the world in 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.130
 reality a really to resist to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.539
 no advances of air resistance is going 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 something like that it's a 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.049
 nature is almost it's more natural 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 it's super interesting like 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.799
 nation for now you added the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 head which is nice when you play 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:46.259
 first a normal first time if 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.780
 we add one mans 1-0 invasions 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.229
 sees the normal paw now that the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.579
 resistance 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:59.009
 now we go with its centering the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.539
 reasoning to the ego but she sees a 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.609
 been voted - center but precisely this is 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.630
 me what is it and that's it 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.490
 fun because it affects my 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.079
 cervical tissue promotes its impact on 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.280
 cervical it's funny go go ahead 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.130
 start again a third time I want 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.250
 not do it four kids 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.630
 go especially strong between the same place 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.580
 in the head it's better shot the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.470
 better at wells and not if they are there 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.720
 is different or not but you go out and 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.130
 wayne rooney better but there you have 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.700
 felt what you felt like by 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.670
 ratio to its equal part value that of the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.320
 leakage film more natural so that's 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.670
 really interesting to think about that 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.410
 a property that has never spoken ever 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.840
 worked in never percussion anything 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.740
 who has acquired this principle of 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.180
 fluidity and this natural word is 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.080
 interesting because often the arts 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.880
 martial 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.100
 if we do we take the sticks 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.630
 traitors said we did not say until the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.220
 black belt we are in the process of 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.240
 modify what is natural have done 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.250
 something that is not natural my 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.100
 fillon package repeats 50 million times 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.450
 the same the same principles and after 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.830
 we say from the black belts and 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.510
 to databases and so you see again 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.910
 assimilated what was acquired as 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.560
 becoming loved what makes the site 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.600
 did we become a white belt 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.940
 because we have it in the blood my in the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.220
 body so the fact that a beginner can 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.720
 to say like I hit it and it's like if 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.580
 it was more natural it is very 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.440
 interesting about the ring his journey 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.640
 we can have in the budo in the water 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.150
 hot at this level just for fun 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.490
 you admitting static I'm going to push you 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.860
 gently static august and solid the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.640
 center and you reside you resist the most 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860
 possible google 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.900
 in addition he has a small gap so alas 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.930
 now you center yourself i happen but we 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.340
 see the difference to puteaux it's 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.530
 the posture that is behind that makes that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.330
 it's in the back 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.350
 here it is it was the master challenge 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.350
 we call
