service

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.380 

just<00:00:54.789> do<00:00:54.940> this

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.360 

I<00:00:58.480> will<00:00:59.140> do<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.260> left<00:00:59.500> side<00:00:59.770> our<00:01:00.010> side

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.570 

in<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.610> top<00:01:05.530> now<00:01:06.530> obviously<00:01:06.800> you<00:01:07.190> can<00:01:07.310> do<00:01:07.460> this

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
in the top now obviously you can do this

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.030 
in the top now obviously you can do this
normally<00:01:07.790> enough

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
normally enough

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.880 
normally enough
and<00:01:10.550> then<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:10.970> do<00:01:11.180> your<00:01:11.570> little<00:01:12.200> sound<00:01:12.650> around

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
and then you do your little sound around

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.130 
and then you do your little sound around
here

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
here

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.180 
here
up<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.680> side

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.510 

only<00:01:18.910> hits<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.180> top<00:01:19.390> see<00:01:19.980> if<00:01:20.980> I<00:01:21.100> try<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.340> cover

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
only hits the top see if I try and cover

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.280 
only hits the top see if I try and cover
that<00:01:21.730> it<00:01:22.090> gets<00:01:22.360> rid<00:01:22.510> of<00:01:22.570> part<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.900> roof<00:01:23.050> so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
that it gets rid of part of the roof so

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.350 
that it gets rid of part of the roof so
that<00:01:23.320> doesn't<00:01:23.710> really<00:01:23.740> work<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.060> if<00:01:25.120> we<00:01:25.150> have

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
that doesn't really work so if we have

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.480 
that doesn't really work so if we have
part<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.930> roof<00:01:26.140> part<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.160> roof<00:01:27.310> we're

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
part of the roof part of roof we're

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.630 
part of the roof part of roof we're
using<00:01:27.700> here<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:29.500> can<00:01:29.710> see<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.400> clearly

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
using here we can see you can clearly

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.430 
using here we can see you can clearly
see<00:01:30.730> that<00:01:31.650> arm

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
see that arm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.250 
see that arm
the<00:01:33.860> background<00:01:34.370> is<00:01:34.640> set<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.150> default<00:01:35.660> grass

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260

little bit here is a mix-up of loads of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.510 
little bit here is a mix-up of loads of
different<00:02:08.200> bits<00:02:09.220> associated<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.369> this

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
different bits associated with this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.760 
different bits associated with this
these<00:02:10.850> two<00:02:11.060> tar<00:02:11.240> sets<00:02:11.540> as<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.500> can<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.680> they

these two tar sets as you can see they

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.710 
these two tar sets as you can see they
were<00:02:12.860> messed<00:02:13.040> up<00:02:13.220> let's<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.540> need<00:02:14.570> to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.220 
changes on all maps so just bear in mind
with<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.450> we<00:04:24.570> have<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.780> pick<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:24.930> since

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
with that so we have to pick one since

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.010 
with that so we have to pick one since
there<00:04:25.470> now<00:04:26.070> some<00:04:27.000> people<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.510> hacks<00:04:27.720> they

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
there now some people in the hacks they

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.530 
there now some people in the hacks they
might<00:04:28.200> say<00:04:28.410> okay<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.970> design<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.360> trees

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
might say okay I the design of the trees

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.000 
might say okay I the design of the trees
is<00:04:30.660> getting<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.900> bit<00:04:30.990> old<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.470> want<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.800> change

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
is getting a bit old so I want to change

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.530 
is getting a bit old so I want to change
the<00:04:32.130> design<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.490> trees<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:33.240> do<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.480> you

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
the design of the trees to do this you

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.600 
the design of the trees to do this you
need<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.780> click<00:04:33.930> Save<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:34.530> which<00:04:35.280> there<00:04:35.490> is

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
need to click Save here which there is

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.440 
need to click Save here which there is
always<00:04:36.540> safe<00:04:36.750> need<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.560> go<00:04:37.680> save<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.760> towel

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
set to one save anywhere and then you

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.720 
set to one save anywhere and then you
can<00:04:42.390> edit<00:04:42.510> in<00:04:42.750> paints<00:04:43.290> or<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.440> similar<00:04:44.310> one<00:04:44.520> and

you can replace the tiles with your own

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.210 
you can replace the tiles with your own
designs<00:04:48.750> tiles<00:04:49.230> all<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.560> tiles<00:04:49.800> from<00:04:49.950> another

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
game my gift from Virgo generation one

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.220 
game my gift from Virgo generation one
so<00:04:53.490> try<00:04:54.240> make<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.510> might<00:04:54.690> make<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:54.930> another

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
so try make it might make it another

so try make it might make it another
video<00:04:55.530> fully<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:56.160> so<00:04:56.780> it's<00:04:57.780> very<00:04:57.930> hard<00:04:58.110> to

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
video fully on that so it's very hard to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.159 
video fully on that so it's very hard to
do<00:04:58.320> those<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:58.740> yeah

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
do those so yeah

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
colors in it I need to go to the let's

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.300 
colors in it I need to go to the let's
and<00:05:10.759> show<00:05:11.419> blitz<00:05:11.659> editor<00:05:12.110> now<00:05:12.770> basically<00:05:13.069> this

allows you to change the colors it need
to<00:05:15.050> collect<00:05:15.379> as<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.860> might<00:05:16.279> know<00:05:16.430> wood

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
to collect as you might know wood

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.850 
to collect as you might know wood
pellets<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:18.110> can<00:05:18.319> only<00:05:18.499> have<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.680> certain

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
pellets you can only have a certain

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.070 
pellets you can only have a certain
number<00:05:19.009> of<00:05:19.129> colors<00:05:19.400> in<00:05:19.520> them<00:05:19.719> and<00:05:20.719> there<00:05:20.960> is

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
number of colors in them and there is

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.439 
number of colors in them and there is
some<00:05:21.289> cards<00:05:21.740> per<00:05:21.860> drop<00:05:22.129> so<00:05:22.490> this<00:05:22.909> applies<00:05:23.210> with

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
some cards per drop so this applies with

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.739 
some cards per drop so this applies with
almost<00:05:23.840> GBA<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.289> over<00:05:25.099> whatever<00:05:25.219> as<00:05:25.550> well<00:05:25.789> so

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:26.749 
almost GBA and over whatever as well so

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.239 
almost GBA and over whatever as well so
for<00:05:26.840> example<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.199> same<00:05:27.349> wants<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.710> do<00:05:27.949> the<00:05:28.069> top

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249 
for example the same wants to do the top

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.040 
for example the same wants to do the top
of<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.430> trees<00:05:28.639> these<00:05:29.210> four<00:05:29.449> colors<00:05:29.749> up<00:05:29.870> here

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
of the trees these four colors up here

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.450 
of the trees these four colors up here
do<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.289> trees<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:30.830> we<00:05:30.860> click<00:05:31.129> on<00:05:31.219> the<00:05:31.249> first

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
do the trees so we click on the first

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.329 
do the trees so we click on the first
one<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.839> now<00:05:32.839> will<00:05:32.990> if<00:05:33.080> we<00:05:33.139> added<00:05:33.289> if<00:05:33.889> I<00:05:34.039> saved

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:34.339 
one and now will if we added if I saved

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.350 
one and now will if we added if I saved
a<00:05:35.860> paint<00:05:36.860> thing<00:05:37.219> of<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.580> black<00:05:37.879> a<00:05:37.909> tree<00:05:38.240> from

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
a paint thing of a black a tree from

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.300 
a paint thing of a black a tree from
black<00:05:38.599> and<00:05:38.629> white<00:05:38.900> and<00:05:39.199> then<00:05:39.710> I<00:05:39.800> click<00:05:40.009> select

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
black and white and then I click select

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.739 
black and white and then I click select
color<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.789> you<00:05:40.939> can<00:05:41.060> put<00:05:41.210> basically<00:05:41.629> your

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:41.749 
color and you can put basically your

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.809 
color and you can put basically your
mouse<00:05:41.870> anywhere<00:05:42.349> on<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.680> whole<00:05:42.800> screen<00:05:43.099> here

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
mouse anywhere on the whole screen here

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.309 
mouse anywhere on the whole screen here
minimize<00:05:44.300> windows<00:05:44.629> and<00:05:44.779> stuff<00:05:44.839> Inc<00:05:45.169> or

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
minimize windows and stuff Inc or

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.350 
minimize windows and stuff Inc or
maximize<00:05:45.770> them<00:05:45.949> and<00:05:46.129> basically<00:05:46.759> I<00:05:47.060> will<00:05:47.240> just

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
maximize them and basically I will just

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.659 
maximize them and basically I will just
tell<00:05:47.930> you<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.199> color<00:05:48.409> of<00:05:48.499> ratios<00:05:48.949> needed<00:05:49.400> for

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
tell you the color of ratios needed for

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.779 
tell you the color of ratios needed for
this<00:05:50.240> color<00:05:50.539> so<00:05:50.900> let's<00:05:51.620> see<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.889> color<00:05:52.370> one

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
this color so let's see the color one

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.929 
this color so let's see the color one
size<00:05:52.819> of<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.210> it's<00:05:53.479> 261<00:05:54.199> a<00:05:54.229> 496<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:55.669> basically

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
size of that it's 261 a 496 so basically

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.689 
size of that it's 261 a 496 so basically
i<00:05:56.060> did<00:05:56.270> that<00:05:56.449> and<00:05:56.479> i<00:05:56.659> got<00:05:56.839> measurements<00:05:57.139> for

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
i did that and i got measurements for

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.649 
i did that and i got measurements for
colors<00:05:58.699> here<00:05:58.939> so<00:05:59.599> first<00:05:59.839> one<00:06:00.020> will<00:06:00.499> become

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
colors here so first one will become

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.600 
colors here so first one will become
4200<00:06:02.659> hundred<00:06:02.960> for<00:06:03.169> these<00:06:03.800> colors<00:06:04.069> go<00:06:04.219> go<00:06:04.580> up

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
4200 hundred for these colors go go up
