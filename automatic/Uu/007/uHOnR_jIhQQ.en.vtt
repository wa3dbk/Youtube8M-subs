00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
flying but let's just try to take a look

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.380 
flying but let's just try to take a look
at<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> animation<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:42.180> oh<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.090> funny

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
at the animation first oh that was funny

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
at the animation first oh that was funny
funny<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.079> jumps<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.219> burst
