00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.970
Hi, I'm James Robyn, President and CEO of
BioNova Natural Pools North America.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.360
I'd like to speak to you today about BioNova's
Quality Process, which consists of a series

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.070
of checkpoints and controls that occur during
the design and construction of your BioNova

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.780
Natural Swimming Pool.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.870
This important Quality Process means that
you'll enjoy the Peace of Mind that comes

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.460
from knowing that your BioNova Natural Pool
was built to the rigorous high standards of

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.920
our international network of BioNova Partners,
and that our headquarters here in North America

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.280
is reviewing all of the design work and requiring
that the construction of your Natural Swimming Pool

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.559
is in conformance with our Quality Process
checkpoints and documentation.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.000
For example, in addition to reviewing all
of the design work, we monitor the laboratory

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.800
analysis of the supply water and other critical
chemical elements in the pool's regeneration zone.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.400
The pool's hydraulic design is reviewed
and approved, and during construction photographs

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.670
are taken, reviewed and filed to insure that
the everything has been done to conform to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.000
the highest standards.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.050
There are more than 20 discrete checkpoints
in our Quality Process and after collecting

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.270
all of this information during the design
and construction process, upon completion

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.200
your BioNova Natural Swimming Pool will be
assigned a registration number,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.200
and a Certificate of Authenticity will be presented to you verifying your Warranty on all of the proprietary BioNova

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.110
products installed on your project.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.300
I know how important controlling quality is
in a swimming pool installation,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.750
and we've put in place a Quality Process that insures
that your BioNova Natural Swimming Pool

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.750
will be as trouble-free and long lasting as possible.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.470
Your friends and family will love swimming
in the natural, chemical-free water, and you'll

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.120
know that your investment is well protected,
ecologically sound and actually beneficial

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.209
to the environment at your home.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:33.000
