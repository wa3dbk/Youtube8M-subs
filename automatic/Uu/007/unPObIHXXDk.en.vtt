00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
which got bashed and one of the main

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.460 
which got bashed and one of the main
reasons<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.240> got<00:02:45.420> bashed<00:02:45.660> was<00:02:45.960> because<00:02:46.440> of

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
reasons that got bashed was because of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.990 
reasons that got bashed was because of
the<00:02:46.770> screenplay<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.400> said<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> was<00:02:47.760> over

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the screenplay they said it was over

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300 
the screenplay they said it was over
wordy<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> lot<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.410> monologues<00:02:50.040> like

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
wordy and just a lot of monologues like

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.460 
wordy and just a lot of monologues like
just<00:02:50.580> don't<00:02:50.820> fit<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> movie<00:02:52.110> which<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
just don't fit for a movie which is a

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.670 
just don't fit for a movie which is a
visual<00:02:53.430> medium<00:02:53.460> right<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.020> think<00:02:55.410> there's<00:02:55.620> a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
visual medium right so I think there's a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440 
visual medium right so I think there's a
lack<00:02:55.950> respect<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.730> part<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.180> it's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
lack respect in that part and it's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.670 
lack respect in that part and it's
similar<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.230> were<00:02:58.320> talking<00:02:58.620> about

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
similar to what you were talking about

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.890 
similar to what you were talking about
with<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.490> lack<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.670> respect<00:03:00.060> for<00:03:00.270> acting<00:03:00.690> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
with the lack of respect for acting I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.960 
with the lack of respect for acting I
think<00:03:01.350> there's<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.560> lack<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.830> respect<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.580> for

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
think there's a lack of respect for for

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.460 
think there's a lack of respect for for
writing<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.690> directing<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
writing and directing and just the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.320 
writing and directing and just the
production<00:03:04.590> process<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.970> people

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
production process that that people

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.960 
production process that that people
either<00:03:06.600> just<00:03:06.900> don't<00:03:07.520> understand<00:03:08.520> or<00:03:08.880> they

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
either just don't understand or they

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
either just don't understand or they
just<00:03:09.840> don't<00:03:10.170> respect<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.890> because<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.340> just

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
just don't respect it because you just

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.610 
just don't respect it because you just
can't<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:12.060> hop<00:03:12.330> over<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.840> things<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.470> not

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
can't just hop over to things it's not

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.350 
can't just hop over to things it's not
that<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.160> simple<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.090> can't<00:03:15.270> be

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
that it's not that simple you can't be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.450 
that it's not that simple you can't be
like<00:03:15.480> I'm<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.020> gonna<00:03:16.140> suddenly<00:03:17.070> I'm<00:03:17.310> gonna

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
like I'm just gonna suddenly I'm gonna

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.130

just<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.210> same<00:03:21.420> way<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.670> screen<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.700> movie

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
just the same way that a screen a movie

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.550 
just the same way that a screen a movie
screen<00:03:24.270> writer<00:03:24.450> can't<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:24.960> go<00:03:25.080> hop<00:03:25.290> into

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
screen writer can't just go hop into

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
screen writer can't just go hop into
comic<00:03:25.860> books<00:03:25.890> yeah<00:03:26.490> because<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.060> totally

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
comic books yeah because it totally

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.630 
comic books yeah because it totally
different<00:03:27.810> than<00:03:27.840> zactly<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.130> work<00:03:29.250> sure

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
different than zactly can it work sure

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.490 
different than zactly can it work sure
but<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.120> doesn't<00:03:30.420> necessarily<00:03:30.450> mean<00:03:31.230> just

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
but it doesn't necessarily mean just

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.230 
but it doesn't necessarily mean just
because<00:03:31.830> our<00:03:32.100> writer<00:03:32.340> they<00:03:32.550> can<00:03:32.670> do<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.940> yeah

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
because our writer they can do it yeah
