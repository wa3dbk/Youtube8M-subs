00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
 Welcome dear 1000 ps fans 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.920
 To test the new kawasaki dog can 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.720
 actually I would have to say yes say that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.240
 The name spills out of America 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.560
 We are called to europe over in america 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.150
 all kawasaki cruiser models are waiting 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.570
 that means that is now with us 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.530
 Even so the 1700 models are called 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.520
 immediately there was no 1700 or volcano 1700 v 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.070
 1 900 will wobble or volcano 900 and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.949
 here we have the females but me 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.109
 say about volcano because you do not have to 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.949
 everything is not all English 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.719
 use the same 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.030
 I also like our german language 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.550
 very cool and I hope that is too 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.929
 perfectly okay that probably it can be 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 completely new model 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.910
 However , she starts right 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.059
 unabashed in kawasaki parts shelf before 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.890
 all he six parts shelf so he 6n he 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.110
 6f and various 650 that is the engine 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.720
 especially with the periphery as well as the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.250
 exhaust are from the six series 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.759
 that is, it is a parallel two 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.909
 cylinder 649 kubicki brown was but 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.020
 on the requirements in a cruiser 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.350
 adapted that is the flywheel 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.950
 was enlarged 28 28 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.649
 heavier than the 63 that is from 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.170
 down out more sovereignty and that 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.210
 you can feel, too, so from 2000 tours can 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.250
 It's normal 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.140
 in the higher transitions yard burns the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.650
 reddish shakes that works 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.960
 very well 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.050
 She also has garden as well as that 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.060
 an influence on should and in 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.460
 middle area is actually quite 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.830
 normal in the higher range it is then 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.360
 of course as he turns six 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.130
 even to 10.000 tours what 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.110
 actually on a bigger one pretty much 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.509
 strangely but in my opinion 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.909
 if you are in the lower area anyway 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.770
 has the advantage that they are very sovereign 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.960
 it does not work if it works 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.300
 she then hears even a small leak 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.580
 advantage of my opinion yes the Eckdaten 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.760
 I actually do not care 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.989
 61 ps are left 63 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.850
 newtonmeter torque 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.980
 through the bank everywhere more than that 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.440
 other rather six models what a lot 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.680
 more important is the simple one 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.019
 driveability of the volcano that yes, too 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.780
 is actually propagated by kawasaki 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.000
 because it is an absolute beginner 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.640
 and be a beginner motorcycle and that can 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.980
 she's really good that's mostly through 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.720
 given the low seat height because of that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.299
 is just the most important thing for you 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.799
 beginner or beginner who wants to join 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.440
 come down the feet because if I 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.269
 already trade with the tiptoe around 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.040
 then I do not feel comfortable 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.829
 a motorcycle and that is in the case 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.959
 given 7 105 mm seat height in the 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.630
 normal version as well as they shipped 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.150
 You will have at the walke or volcano 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.600
 It is also the possibility of different 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.040
 kits so two other kids, so to speak 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.260
 to be installed with a lower saddle 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.600
 or a higher sato then you can 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.380
 just also the footpegs forward 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.470
 and behind each relocate by 25 mm and 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.870
 It can also be the handlebars times 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.579
 adapt that is but rather so far let 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.200
 because the possibility then becomes one 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.790
 other handlebars mounted that means that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.010
 In reality, I can do it with everyone 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.019
 to make a motorcycle but kawasaki calls 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.390
 ergo fit system that means there is 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.910
 Three different kits you get on this 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.100
 volcano it can assemble around itself 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.709
 personal ergonomics, so to speak 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.660
 make it that one is 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.220
 real cruiser acts you also notice 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.859
 the front brake system is one 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.480
 single disc plant with two pistons 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.540
 calipers that works is yes times 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.590
 corresponding 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.209
 a cruiser so she stops 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.430
 not necessarily athletic but that 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.549
 is not on this model anyway 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.829
 necessarily wanted and she surprised 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.629
 well not so she is not too close now 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.609
 brute that scares you 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.329
 could and in reality that fits in there 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.879
 well to 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.120
 to the basic equipment so to series 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.609
 These include adjustable levers 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.459
 for the clutch and for the brake that 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.690
 I also like what 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.269
 beginners probably also great value 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.799
 be put to the up 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.169
 can adjust properly 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.940
 So that's the mix of mine 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.400
 opinion after the very successful are the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.780
 fix there are what but one 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.180
 small lie from me to kawasaki needs 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.000
 say I once is the optional one 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.210
 aisle smart you can order them 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.590
 she is in the cockpit at the top left then 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.070
 actually pretty snappy again 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.349
 is mounted outside the cockpit 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.509
 even if it is already available as an option 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.510
 is an extra cost I think so 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.370
 other models have that actually 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.250
 already fix why you can say there 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.590
 such a tam-tam makes around this gang announcement 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.810
 she is just for beginners and beginners 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.940
 but I find it very necessary there 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.010
 then also a socket on the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.430
 the other side is the one you can see 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.280
 Also available as an option gets the 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.000
 It is called the total volcano 1 1 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.580
 very 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.630
 such a special kawasaki model 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.830
 I guess I did not vote 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.169
 absolutely waiting for it though 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.690
 maybe that's why she is 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.300
 once successful because they are 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.849
 appeals to beginners she is handy 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.669
 Although she is in the 225 kilo 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.650
 you can not feel uncomfortable it is 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.419
 not too hard it is just a deep 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.849
 focus is the trade they can 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.820
 should throw well through the curves 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:45.700
 because the landing gear is also successful 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.410
 and that's just the beginner 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.910
 they may be afraid of too 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.760
 have sporty models 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.200
 this is a cruiser because everyone knows okay 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.620
 that does not have much to do with sport 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.170
 do 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.260
 that will not overwhelm me and me 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.810
 can attest that the volcano it too 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.060
 really will not overwhelm anyone and 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.770
 that just because he has 6 engine inside only 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.810
 We should not be so bad now 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.530
 After all, she has already completely bothered 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.430
 strange cruiser naked bikes given the 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.460
 yamaha 0 1 with a cruiser engine in the 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.280
 naked bike so such a one 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.620
 frankenstein is not that at all 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.570
 a successful motorcycle that I guess 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.790
 once his fans will find 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.450
 if she is still really successful 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.040
 of course depends on the price from scarce 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.320
 It will cost 8300 euros 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.330
 that 's for a beginner motorcycle now 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.410
 Although not a little, however, will be synonymous 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.300
 quite a lot 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.520
 It is actually available immediately 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.590
 So who wants to strike easy to 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.260
 kawasaki dealers will go around too 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.810
 This ergo fit system is superior to what you get 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.980
 needs what you would like to have just like you 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.980
 sitting on top of it
