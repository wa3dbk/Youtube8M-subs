the<00:00:06.300> Met<00:00:06.510> book<00:00:06.840> is<00:00:07.220> our<00:00:08.220> most<00:00:08.400> popular<00:00:08.730> mac<00:00:09.800> but

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
the Met book is our most popular mac but

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.670 
the Met book is our most popular mac but
what<00:00:10.950> we've<00:00:11.190> what<00:00:11.730> we've<00:00:11.790> done<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.680> we've

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
what we've what we've done and we've

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.550 
what we've what we've done and we've
made<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.890> habit<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.400> doing<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.760> it<00:00:14.910> Apple<00:00:15.269> is

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is
is<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.980> decided<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> start<00:00:18.539> over

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.980 

the<00:00:22.619> new<00:00:22.740> macbook<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> quite<00:00:23.880> remarkable

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.710 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:25.010> achievement<00:00:26.360> it<00:00:27.360> really

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.370 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.760> complete<00:00:30.240> revolution<00:00:30.689> in

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:43.979 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.279> notebooks<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.820> made

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.509 

and<00:00:44.989> traditionally<00:00:45.230> notebooks<00:00:46.100> are<00:00:46.280> made

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
and traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.619 
and traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:47.260> multiple<00:00:48.260> parts<00:00:49.089> but<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:50.180> problem<00:00:50.510> is

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.170 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.289> have<00:00:51.559> multiple<00:00:52.010> parts<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.030> add

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.590 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.019> weight<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.729> and<00:00:55.729> you<00:00:55.820> increase<00:00:56.300> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.959 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:57.170> for<00:00:57.199> failure<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.539 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:59.659> breakthrough<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.799> we<00:01:01.010> heard<00:01:01.309> with

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.539 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:01:01.729> the<00:01:01.760> macbook<00:01:02.409> was<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.619> replace<00:01:03.860> all<00:01:04.220> of

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
with the macbook was to replace all of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.840 
with the macbook was to replace all of
those<00:01:04.699> parts<00:01:05.180> with<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:06.020> one<00:01:06.350> part<00:01:06.649> and<00:01:07.070> at

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.109 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:08.030> part<00:01:08.299> we<00:01:08.450> called<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.810> unibody<00:01:10.119> we

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
one part we called the unibody we

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.020 
one part we called the unibody we
figured<00:01:11.600> out<00:01:11.689> a<00:01:11.750> way<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.490> being<00:01:13.490> able<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.729> make

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
figured out a way of being able to make

that we've we've never even dreamed of
before<00:01:24.649> and<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.630> only<00:01:26.960> way<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.920> make<00:01:28.159> that<00:01:28.549> one

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
before and the only way to make that one

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.090 
before and the only way to make that one
part<00:01:29.090> was<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.840> machine<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.380> from<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.679> single

the solid block of aluminum then we go

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.460 
the solid block of aluminum then we go
through<00:01:57.580> an<00:01:57.700> extrusion<00:01:58.119> process<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:59.320> kind

this industry we have been so fanatical
in<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.690> tolerances<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.769> how<00:02:49.280> we<00:02:49.340> machine<00:02:49.910> and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
in the tolerances of how we machine and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.250 
in the tolerances of how we machine and
build<00:02:50.360> these<00:02:50.510> products<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:53.569> many<00:02:54.019> ways<00:02:54.230> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
build these products in many ways I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.740 
build these products in many ways I
think<00:02:54.799> it's<00:02:55.099> more<00:02:55.250> beautiful<00:02:56.090> internally

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750

then<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.769> is<00:02:57.799> externally<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.900> mean<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.049> think

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
then it is externally I mean I think

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.640 
then it is externally I mean I think
