00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130

threaded<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:32.969> needle<00:00:33.090> early<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> first

half how bcp get out to the big lead I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.020 
half how bcp get out to the big lead I
thought<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.460> swung<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> momentum

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
thought that really swung the momentum

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.319 
thought that really swung the momentum
and<00:00:39.870> also<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:41.010> very

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
and also would was very

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.190 
and also would was very
uncharacteristically<00:00:42.329> penalized<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
uncharacteristically penalized in the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
uncharacteristically penalized in the
first<00:00:43.410> half<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.770> second<00:00:44.340> drive<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
first half that second drive they have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
first half that second drive they have
four<00:00:45.690> penalties<00:00:46.230> call<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.340> span<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
four penalties call on them in a span of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.940 
four penalties call on them in a span of
five<00:00:48.059> plays<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.780> were<00:00:48.870> inside<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> 25

five plays when they were inside the 25

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
five plays when they were inside the 25
I<00:00:50.520> thought<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.210> huge<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> turning<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I thought that was huge and turning the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
I thought that was huge and turning the
momentum<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> game<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:54.030> give<00:00:54.300> would<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
momentum of this game well give would a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
momentum of this game well give would a
lot<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> credit<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.559> fell<00:00:55.829> behind<00:00:55.980> by<00:00:56.280> 17<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
lot of credit they fell behind by 17 a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.069 
lot of credit they fell behind by 17 a
lot<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> teams<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> rolled<00:00:57.780> over

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
