00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the second note of that paradiddle is an

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
the second note of that paradiddle is an
upstroke<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> important<00:00:47.579> note

upstroke and that's the important note

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.569 
upstroke and that's the important note
to<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.320> fluid<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.430> get

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
to make it nice and fluid as we get

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.600 
to make it nice and fluid as we get
faster<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:54.739> let's<00:00:55.739> try<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> track

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
faster so let's try that with the track

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.639 
faster so let's try that with the track
we're<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> play<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> exercise<00:00:58.260> at

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we're going to play this exercise at

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:28.850 
we're going to play this exercise at
tempo<00:00:59.579> 3<00:01:26.659> our<00:01:27.659> rudiments<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> list<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
tempo 3 our rudiments are a list of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550 
tempo 3 our rudiments are a list of
patterns<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> basics<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.110> drumming

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
patterns that are the basics of drumming

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
patterns that are the basics of drumming
now<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.579> take<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:32.970> patterns<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
now we can take these patterns and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.109 
now we can take these patterns and
manipulate<00:01:34.560> them<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.829> different<00:01:35.189> ways<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
manipulate them in different ways so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
manipulate them in different ways so
don't<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.840> paradiddles<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> play

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
don't just take paradiddles and play

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.969 
don't just take paradiddles and play
them<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.240> downbeat<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.619> move<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
them on the downbeat we can move the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.639 
them on the downbeat we can move the
accent<00:01:41.490> around<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.720> change<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> sticking

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
accent around we can change the sticking

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.300 
accent around we can change the sticking
up<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.670> move<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> diddle<00:01:45.630> around<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.950> sorts

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
up to move the diddle around all sorts

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
up to move the diddle around all sorts
of<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:47.820> ways<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.360> play<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.720> in

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
of different ways we can play it in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.770 
of different ways we can play it in
different<00:01:49.170> time<00:01:49.380> signatures<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.399> 3<00:01:51.360> against<00:01:51.750> 4

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
different time signatures in 3 against 4

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.280 
different time signatures in 3 against 4
which<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:53.100> now
