00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you're if you're good I mean the whole

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
you're if you're good I mean the whole
point<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> become<00:00:47.430> pro<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> wouldn't

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
point is to become pro so you wouldn't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
point is to become pro so you wouldn't
want<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> treat<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.770> wouldn't<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
want to treat your you wouldn't want to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
want to treat your you wouldn't want to
treat<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.550> prep<00:00:50.789> any<00:00:50.940> differently<00:00:51.390> always

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
treat your prep any differently always

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.069 
treat your prep any differently always
you<00:00:52.110> always<00:00:52.350> dress<00:00:53.239> one<00:00:54.239> step<00:00:54.629> above<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you always dress one step above the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
you always dress one step above the
position<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
position you want right so you do the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
position you want right so you do the
same<00:00:57.420> prep<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.559> still<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> same

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
same prep and it's still the same

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
same prep and it's still the same
expenditure<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> difference<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
expenditure but the difference is you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
expenditure but the difference is you
have<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.530> access<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> shows<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have more access to shows because you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
have more access to shows because you
can<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.120> anywhere<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.019> plus<00:01:04.799> your

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
can go anywhere and do one plus your

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
can go anywhere and do one plus your
chances<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> getting<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.030> trophy<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.570> much

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
chances of getting a trophy are much

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
chances of getting a trophy are much
greater<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:10.080> example<00:01:10.560> since<00:01:11.549> I've<00:01:11.729> been<00:01:11.850> Pro

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
greater for example since I've been Pro

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
greater for example since I've been Pro
I<00:01:12.450> haven't<00:01:12.900> been<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> couple<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I haven't been in but a couple of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
I haven't been in but a couple of
magazines<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.170> amateur<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
magazines but as an amateur I was in

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.020 
magazines but as an amateur I was in
almost<00:01:18.090> 30<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.549> almost<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
almost 30 so I think you almost get a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
almost 30 so I think you almost get a
little<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.509> attention<00:01:22.130> direct<00:01:23.130> attention

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
little more attention direct attention

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969 
little more attention direct attention
as<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:23.939> amateur<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> accolade

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
as an amateur but you have the accolade

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.320 
as an amateur but you have the accolade
of<00:01:26.009> being<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.430> pro<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.790> no<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.119> take<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
of being a pro and no one can take that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.640 
of being a pro and no one can take that
from<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:29.490> brings<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:31.170> bit<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> clout

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
