00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
640 by 480 but in windowed mode so what

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.830 
640 by 480 but in windowed mode so what
640<00:01:45.509> by<00:01:45.600> 480<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.500> look<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.759> box<00:01:48.509> mode

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
640 by 480 would look like in a box mode

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
640 by 480 would look like in a box mode
it's<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.590> small<00:01:50.009> I'll<00:01:50.310> kind<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it's actually pretty small I'll kind of

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's actually pretty small I'll kind of
make<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> square<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.689> big<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> month<00:01:52.200> would

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
make a square on how big a month would

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.130 
make a square on how big a month would
be<00:01:52.619> it'd<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:54.000> there<00:01:54.240> wait

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
be it'd be about right there wait

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.219 
be it'd be about right there wait
actually<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> better<00:01:56.310> idea<00:01:56.430> okay<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
actually I got a better idea okay so it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
actually I got a better idea okay so it
will<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.979> should<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
will be about it should be about that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.469 
will be about it should be about that
large<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.670> that's<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:02.880> than<00:02:03.060> enough<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
large and that's more than enough to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
large and that's more than enough to
play<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.350> least<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.829> fine<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.399> you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
play your game on at least I fine if you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.639 
play your game on at least I fine if you
have<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> big<00:02:05.909> screen<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.200> even<00:02:07.320> easier

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
have a big screen it will be even easier

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440 
have a big screen it will be even easier
to<00:02:08.129> play<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> pretty<00:02:09.209> small

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to play on if you have a pretty small

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.660 
to play on if you have a pretty small
screen<00:02:09.720> though<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.319> pretty<00:02:11.310> small

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
screen though it will be pretty small

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.010 
screen though it will be pretty small
for<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
for you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
for you
but<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.770> does<00:02:14.040> make<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.460> game<00:02:14.640> run<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:14.910> 640<00:02:15.510> by

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
but it does make the game run in 640 by

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.920 
but it does make the game run in 640 by
480<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:17.460> way<00:02:17.910> easy<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.270> run<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
480 and it is way easy to run the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.510 
480 and it is way easy to run the
resolution<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.530> actually<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> main<00:02:20.100> part<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
resolution is actually the main part you

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.830 
resolution is actually the main part you
can<00:02:20.670> actually<00:02:20.820> probably<00:02:21.090> run<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> game<00:02:21.630> on

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
can actually probably run the game on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.710 
can actually probably run the game on
full<00:02:22.350> high<00:02:22.680> settings<00:02:23.130> armed<00:02:23.570> with<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
full high settings armed with the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.930 
full high settings armed with the
resolution<00:02:25.230> tone<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.370> won't

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
resolution tone down to this it won't

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.940 
resolution tone down to this it won't
most<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.720> with<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.230> much<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:28.740> it's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
most like with like that much if it's

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.610 
most like with like that much if it's
like<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:30.900> how<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.500> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
like that but that is how you do it it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.170 
like that but that is how you do it it
will<00:02:31.770> run<00:02:32.010> way<00:02:32.250> faster<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.000> that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
will run way faster if you do that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
will run way faster if you do that
