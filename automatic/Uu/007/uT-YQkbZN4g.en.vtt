 recovery suddenly something will not go 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.390
 so that you can roll back and so in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.239

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.890
 So 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.320
 We look what happened there is turned on 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.460
 food included personalization features 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.090
 but they are not active need to restart 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:25.170
 our virtual machine 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 We press the restart so we wait a little 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560
 so our operating system is loading 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:14.170
 home base system 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.290
 and check if functions are activated 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.010
 personalization 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.250
 had the right mouse button remove 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.579
 personalization and she got involved that is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.280
 now we can install themes 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.980
 then we can download other themes in 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:44.180
 the internet 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:48.799
 microsoft site for example for example here 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.980
 I like it, that is, you choose 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.840
 can choose category 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.810
 for example the terrain of the landscape and choose 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.019
 any clicking on the download button 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:06.260
 either you can click more and 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.859
 view background images in this 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.079
 topic 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:16.010
 But if you have in you all like Hit 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:19.510
 download the theme it is downloaded and we and 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.510
 then install 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.240
 so the topic was 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.880
 Christmas tree 14 half practically megabytes 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.289
 wait a little 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.740
 I have already installed several topics 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.220
 there we can choose any of these topics 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.460
 set while swinging and ours is like 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:05.600
 it will look like this 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:10.229
 image that is all functions 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.320
 personalizations that are available in more 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.990
 older versions for example in windows all 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:21.360
 the maximum available to you will be using 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:30.990
 This match for what to say is huge 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:33.599
 Thank you, Sergey Tkachenko. 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.310
 downloaded file and we are installing 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:42.960
 The theme of the topic has been established and it appears 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:48.509
 in the personalization window so here she is 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:51.409
 It looks like a theme in principle 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:54.360
 this way you can enable functions 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.900
 personalization in the operating system 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.159
 windows 7 initial and windows 7 home 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.880
 basic 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:06.990
 so it was all tested on 32-bit 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:12.150
 operating system i hope it also 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:14.610
 will work well on 64-bit 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.570
 the operating system with you was Anton 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.949

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.949
