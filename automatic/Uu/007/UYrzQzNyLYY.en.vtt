done anything all game his hand is yeah
and<00:07:24.500> there<00:07:24.650> we<00:07:24.740> go<00:07:25.780> now<00:07:26.780> it's<00:07:26.960> on<00:07:27.080> takes<00:07:27.319> down

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530

and there we go now it's on takes down
that<00:07:27.800> submerge<00:07:28.220> play<00:07:28.400> was<00:07:28.639> pretty<00:07:29.210> awesome<00:07:30.789> it

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:31.789 
that submerge play was pretty awesome it

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:33.070 
that submerge play was pretty awesome it
ended<00:07:32.030> up<00:07:32.150> not<00:07:32.330> mattering<00:07:32.509> two<00:07:32.840> months

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
ended up not mattering two months

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.200 
ended up not mattering two months
because<00:07:33.289> Jason<00:07:33.590> just<00:07:33.740> had<00:07:33.830> stone<00:07:34.099> pelting<00:07:34.340> but

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.210 
because Jason just had stone pelting but

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.499 
because Jason just had stone pelting but
it<00:07:35.930> very<00:07:36.740> likely<00:07:36.919> could<00:07:37.340> have<00:07:37.580> matter<00:07:37.879> but<00:07:38.389> an

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509 
it very likely could have matter but an

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.050 
it very likely could have matter but an
important<00:07:39.139> play<00:07:39.469> to<00:07:40.009> keep<00:07:40.219> in<00:07:40.460> mind<00:07:40.729> and

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
important play to keep in mind and

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.260 
important play to keep in mind and
legacy<00:07:41.599> you<00:07:41.990> have<00:07:42.199> submerge<00:07:42.849> you<00:07:43.849> want<00:07:44.150> to

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
legacy you have submerge you want to

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.390 
legacy you have submerge you want to
cast<00:07:44.539> it<00:07:44.719> in<00:07:44.870> response<00:07:45.409> to<00:07:45.710> a<00:07:45.740> veg<00:07:46.069> land

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 
cast it in response to a veg land

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.390 
cast it in response to a veg land
because<00:07:46.969> this<00:07:47.449> force<00:07:48.050> then<00:07:48.259> put<00:07:48.620> the<00:07:48.800> creature

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 
because this force then put the creature

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.980 
because this force then put the creature
on<00:07:49.610> top<00:07:49.789> of<00:07:49.879> the<00:07:50.030> library<00:07:50.419> that<00:07:50.509> is<00:07:50.569> about<00:07:50.840> to

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
on top of the library that is about to

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.900 
on top of the library that is about to
get<00:07:51.080> shuffled<00:07:51.349> anyway

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:52.910 
get shuffled anyway

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.070 
get shuffled anyway
and<00:07:53.000> then<00:07:53.120> you<00:07:53.240> don't<00:07:53.480> double<00:07:53.960> that

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 
and then you don't double that

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.890 
and then you don't double that
permanently<00:07:54.530> yep
