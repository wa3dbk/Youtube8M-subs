00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.079 

all<00:00:02.429> right<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.030> bought<00:00:04.310> these<00:00:05.310> new<00:00:05.370> mirrors

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
all right so I bought these new mirrors

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.980 
all right so I bought these new mirrors
here<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:08.370> reason<00:00:08.760> why<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> bought<00:00:09.389> them<00:00:09.660> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
here and the reason why I bought them is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.830 
here and the reason why I bought them is
because<00:00:10.530> if<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.190> see<00:00:11.219> right<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:11.840> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
because if you can see right here and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.070 
because if you can see right here and
has<00:00:12.990> an<00:00:13.139> LED<00:00:13.380> turn<00:00:13.980> signal<00:00:14.570> they<00:00:15.570> looked<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.929> lot

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
has an LED turn signal they looked a lot

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.590 
has an LED turn signal they looked a lot
better<00:00:16.320> than<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:18.020> OEM<00:00:19.020> mirrors<00:00:20.779> taking-off

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
better than the OEM mirrors taking-off

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.480 
better than the OEM mirrors taking-off
bike<00:00:24.600> already<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:27.140> replaced<00:00:28.429> them<00:00:29.429> with

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
bike already and replaced them with

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.740 
bike already and replaced them with
these<00:00:29.970> new<00:00:30.300> mirrors<00:00:31.640> now<00:00:35.270> takes<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.420> little<00:00:36.540> bit

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
these new mirrors now takes a little bit

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.530 
these new mirrors now takes a little bit
to<00:00:36.989> wire<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to wire these up you have to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.270 
to wire these up you have to
well<00:00:39.989> first<00:00:40.320> off<00:00:40.559> let<00:00:40.800> me<00:00:40.829> show<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
well first off let me show you the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
well first off let me show you the
bottom<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:44.149> did<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.870> mount

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
bottom here I did not like the mount

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.880 
bottom here I did not like the mount
that<00:00:46.860> came<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.700> kit<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> mirror<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that came with the kit for the mirror so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.580 
that came with the kit for the mirror so
what<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> did<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> used<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.050> original

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
what I did was is I used my original

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.310 
what I did was is I used my original
mount<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.059> OEM<00:00:54.480> mount<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.930> comes<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
mount the OEM mount that comes on the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
mount the OEM mount that comes on the
bike<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.770> took<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.910> OEM<00:00:57.420> mirrors<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:57.960> by

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
bike I took the OEM mirrors off by

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.250 
bike I took the OEM mirrors off by
loosening<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.039> bolt<00:00:59.250> that's<00:00:59.460> right<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
loosening the bolt that's right here and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
loosening the bolt that's right here and
then<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.730> had<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> shave<00:01:03.979> this<00:01:04.979> part<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> new

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
then I had to shave this part of the new

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.490 
then I had to shave this part of the new
kit<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.590> fit<00:01:07.890> down<00:01:08.070> into<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> OEM<00:01:10.200> mount

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
kit down to fit down into the OEM mount

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.240 
kit down to fit down into the OEM mount
I<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.460> used<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> file<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.720> plastic<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I just used the file this is plastic is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
I just used the file this is plastic is
real<00:01:14.520> easy<00:01:14.700> took<00:01:15.119> me<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.509> don't<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.259> 10

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
real easy took me I don't know 10

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.539 
real easy took me I don't know 10
minutes<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.130> file<00:01:17.430> each<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.570> down<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
minutes to file each one down to to the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
minutes to file each one down to to the
right<00:01:20.729> size<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.360> fit<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> put

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
right size so it fit in there then I put

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730 
right size so it fit in there then I put
the<00:01:22.890> bolt<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.030> mounted<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.560> whole

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the bolt in and then I mounted the whole

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
the bolt in and then I mounted the whole
assembly<00:01:26.280> back<00:01:26.490> onto<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.939> bike<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.869> see

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
assembly back onto the bike you can see

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.700 
assembly back onto the bike you can see
since<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> has<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.479> light<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> see

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
since it has the light here do you see

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.429 
since it has the light here do you see
this<00:01:31.890> wire<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.200> runs

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
this wire right here this is what runs

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
this wire right here this is what runs
that<00:01:34.650> light<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> drill<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.000> small

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that light you have to drill a small

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.730 
that light you have to drill a small
hole<00:01:37.310> through<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> fairing<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.180> bike<00:01:39.740> so

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
hole through the fairing of your bike so

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.630 
hole through the fairing of your bike so
you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.979> wire<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.329> light<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you can wire the the light back up so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.359 
you can wire the the light back up so
now<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.790> you've<00:01:45.060> seen<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:46.159> here's<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
now that you've seen that here's the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.690 
now that you've seen that here's the
wiring<00:01:48.290> if<00:01:49.290> anybody's<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:49.799> familiar<00:01:50.490> that's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
wiring if anybody's not familiar that's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.289 
wiring if anybody's not familiar that's
an<00:01:50.880> LED<00:01:51.390> light<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.899> inside<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:55.619> new

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
an LED light that's inside the the new

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.749 
an LED light that's inside the the new
mirror<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> resistor

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
mirror and if you don't put a resistor

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
mirror and if you don't put a resistor
in<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.299> LED<00:02:00.689> light<00:02:00.899> its<00:02:01.409> gonna<00:02:01.590> blink<00:02:01.950> real

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
in an LED light its gonna blink real

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.569 
in an LED light its gonna blink real
fast<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> does<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.780> makes<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.799> bike

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
fast what it does is it makes the bike

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.020 
fast what it does is it makes the bike
think<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.719> bulb<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:08.030> because

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
think that you have a bulb out because

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.990 
think that you have a bulb out because
LEDs<00:02:09.330> draw<00:02:09.780> less<00:02:09.989> power

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
LEDs draw less power

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.850 
LEDs draw less power
so<00:02:11.510> inside<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.680> black<00:02:13.040> I've<00:02:17.380> put<00:02:18.380> electrical

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so inside this black I've put electrical

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.580 
so inside this black I've put electrical
tape<00:02:19.100> around<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.610> because<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.090> gets<00:02:20.210> hot

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
tape around it because it gets hot

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.030 
tape around it because it gets hot
they'll<00:02:21.590> start<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.010> get<00:02:22.160> hot<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.540> these

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
they'll start to get hot is one of these

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.940 
they'll start to get hot is one of these
just<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.190> $6<00:02:26.440> 6<00:02:27.440> ohm<00:02:27.940> resistor

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
just a $6 6 ohm resistor

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.480 

so<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.959> way<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.620> wire<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.190> is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
so the way you have to wire this is

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.370 
so the way you have to wire this is
right<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:36.620> wire<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.310> mirror<00:02:40.310> I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
right here is the wire from the mirror I

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.890 
right here is the wire from the mirror I
extended<00:02:42.380> those<00:02:42.530> two<00:02:42.800> wires<00:02:43.300> by<00:02:44.300> putting<00:02:44.780> my

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
extended those two wires by putting my

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.720 
extended those two wires by putting my
own<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.560> wiring<00:02:45.980> kit<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.370> put<00:02:46.580> my

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
own and I have a wiring kit so I put my

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
own and I have a wiring kit so I put my
own<00:02:46.760> wires<00:02:47.180> onto<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:49.550> two<00:02:49.790> leads<00:02:50.090> from<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
own wires onto the two leads from the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.610 
own wires onto the two leads from the
mirror<00:02:52.040> because<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.300> leads<00:02:53.569> are<00:02:53.780> very<00:02:54.050> thin

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
mirror because the leads are very thin

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.680 
mirror because the leads are very thin
I've<00:02:55.010> got<00:02:55.190> wired<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.610> other<00:02:55.760> side<00:02:56.060> up<00:02:56.239> but<00:02:56.450> I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
I've got wired the other side up but I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.210 
I've got wired the other side up but I
don't<00:02:57.050> know<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.440> could<00:02:57.560> see<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.010> but

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
don't know if you could see that but

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.080 
don't know if you could see that but
those<00:02:58.370> are<00:02:58.550> really<00:02:58.730> thin<00:03:00.160> leads<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.760> wanted

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
those are really thin leads so I wanted

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.590 
those are really thin leads so I wanted
a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.330> bit<00:03:02.540> thicker<00:03:02.870> wire<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.600> cut

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
a little bit thicker wire so I just cut

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.380 
a little bit thicker wire so I just cut
some<00:03:05.630> wire<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.290> put<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> onto<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:07.069> and

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
some wire and I put it onto there and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.820 
some wire and I put it onto there and
then<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.600> use<00:03:08.870> these<00:03:09.110> clips<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:10.340> clip<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.760> in

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
then I use these clips to clip it in

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.920 
then I use these clips to clip it in
these<00:03:12.830> clips<00:03:13.160> right<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.610> now<00:03:14.569> what<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.900> have

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
these clips right here now what you have

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.030 
these clips right here now what you have
to<00:03:15.080> do<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.519> have<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.760> run<00:03:16.970> wire<00:03:17.209> from

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
to do is is you have to run wire from

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.430 
to do is is you have to run wire from
the<00:03:19.040> lead<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:22.310> resistor<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:24.290> they're

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
the lead to the resistor so they're

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.759 
the lead to the resistor so they're
wired<00:03:24.650> into<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.010> resistor<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.819> then<00:03:26.299> from

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
wired into the resistor and then from

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.400 
wired into the resistor and then from
there<00:03:27.769> down<00:03:28.640> into<00:03:29.030> where<00:03:29.239> it'll<00:03:30.110> get<00:03:30.260> its

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
there down into where it'll get its

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.789 
there down into where it'll get its
power<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.130> right<00:03:31.370> down<00:03:31.519> in<00:03:31.730> here<00:03:32.440> let<00:03:33.440> me<00:03:33.560> turn

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
power and right down in here let me turn

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.979 
power and right down in here let me turn
on<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.120> can't<00:03:35.120> turn<00:03:35.329> on<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.570> light<00:03:35.750> right<00:03:35.959> now

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
on the can't turn on the light right now

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.130 
on the can't turn on the light right now
right<00:03:36.890> down<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.190> here<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.390> OEM<00:03:38.870> connectors

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
right down in here is the OEM connectors

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.319 
right down in here is the OEM connectors
for<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.660> side<00:03:41.660> turn<00:03:42.049> signal<00:03:42.079> on<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:43.130> bike<00:03:43.340> so

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
for the side turn signal on the bike so

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.190 
for the side turn signal on the bike so
all<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:45.109> now<00:03:45.380> spliced<00:03:45.799> in<00:03:46.010> together<00:03:46.160> and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
all that is now spliced in together and

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.520 
all that is now spliced in together and
wire<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.380> up<00:03:48.470> properly<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:50.019> once<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.200> was<00:03:51.350> done

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
wire it up properly and once I was done

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.319 
wire it up properly and once I was done
with<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.769> I<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.609> turn<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.329> bike<00:03:53.540> on<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:55.329> hit

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
with that I can turn the bike on and hit

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.970 
with that I can turn the bike on and hit
the<00:03:56.570> signal<00:03:57.500> here<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:58.670> can<00:03:59.000> see<00:03:59.709> that<00:04:00.709> both

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
the signal here you can see that both

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.220 
the signal here you can see that both
turn<00:04:01.880> signals<00:04:02.739> are<00:04:03.739> blinking

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
turn signals are blinking

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.009 
turn signals are blinking
all<00:04:06.680> right<00:04:06.890> if<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.940> hadn't<00:04:08.239> put<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.540> resistor

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
all right if I hadn't put the resistor

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.460 
all right if I hadn't put the resistor
in<00:04:09.170> there<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:10.430> would<00:04:10.940> blink<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.019> little<00:04:12.230> fast

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
in there it would blink a little fast

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.550 
in there it would blink a little fast
and<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.790> would<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.659> me<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.930> looks<00:04:15.140> funny

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
and it would to me it looks funny

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.620 
and it would to me it looks funny
it<00:04:15.739> looks<00:04:16.010> unprofessional<00:04:16.699> when<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.389> do<00:04:17.540> it

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
it looks unprofessional when you do it

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.939 
it looks unprofessional when you do it
that<00:04:17.780> way<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.760> that's<00:04:19.760> how<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.000> did<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.949> I'm

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
that way so that's how I did it I'm

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.159 
that way so that's how I did it I'm
gonna<00:04:22.160> wire<00:04:22.400> up<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.699> other<00:04:22.820> side<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.449> I'll

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
gonna wire up the other side and I'll

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.590 
gonna wire up the other side and I'll
take<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.470> video<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:25.070> what<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.340> looks<00:04:25.520> like<00:04:25.729> when

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
take a video of what it looks like when

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.950 
take a video of what it looks like when
it's<00:04:26.750> all<00:04:26.870> put<00:04:26.930> back<00:04:27.470> together<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:28.960> both

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
it's all put back together and both

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.550 
it's all put back together and both
mirrors<00:04:30.229> are<00:04:30.530> both<00:04:30.979> lights<00:04:31.250> are<00:04:31.430> working
