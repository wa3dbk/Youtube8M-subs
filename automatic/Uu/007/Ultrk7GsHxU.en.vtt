Hi!

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:09.200
I wan to show you the rubber cleaner functioning on two used rubbers

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:25.100
First of all - so that we can compare - let's have a look the Falco "Life Expander"!

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.580
...and the other rubber we will see the "revo" (Revolution No. 3) cleaner.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.680
...still it looks the shabby surface...

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:16.001
Let's go one more layer!

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.300
drying in progress...

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:57.600
I do not claim that it was not right, but you can see here the shabby on surface.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.760
Now let's look this shabby (Donic) Desto

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:29.140
with "Revo"... (Revolution No. 3 Cleaner)

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.240
It's almost dry

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.860
the result.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.420
After drying...

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.000
I do not know, you see an abrasion? ...
I did not.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.820
on this still seems...

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.760
But I was treated twice this with Falco...

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760
...with the "life Expander"...

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.540
Do you see this?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.540
Let's go, repair it too with "Revo"!

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.380
That's what I'm talking about!...

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
As the advertising slogan says...

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.100
This is proof! No promises.

00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:55.205
Thank You! Bye!
