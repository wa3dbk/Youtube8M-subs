00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.920 
come on I thought of the first pitching
second<00:02:37.760> bleaching<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.569> pretty<00:02:38.780> much<00:02:38.870> to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
second bleaching I was pretty much to

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.960 
second bleaching I was pretty much to
get<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.410> bottom<00:02:39.739> orange<00:02:40.130> out<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.519> wanted<00:02:40.849> to

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
get the bottom orange out I wanted to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.140 
get the bottom orange out I wanted to
kind<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.269> match<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.540> top<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:41.989> head<00:02:42.170> so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
kind of match the top in the head so

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.460 
kind of match the top in the head so
technically<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.450> kind<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.720> left<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.080> top<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.410> my

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
technically I kind of left the top of my

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.559 
technically I kind of left the top of my
head<00:02:45.620> around<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:46.069> threw<00:02:46.160> my<00:02:46.280> roots<00:02:46.519> or<00:02:47.030> you
