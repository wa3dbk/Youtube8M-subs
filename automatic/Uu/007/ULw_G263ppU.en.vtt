 we start doing twisting only 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.230
 when we carried the weight to the supporting leg 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.690
 next movement is twisting hip 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.290

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 in this variation partner unlike 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 usual twist leads partner not 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.560
 forward exactly to myself while I'm wrong 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.560

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.729
 fighters partner performer able 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.069
 counter balance the first thing that happens 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 pressure in a partner's arm and hip output and 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.209
 then the hips move vertical 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.610
 plane partner continues to work 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.080
 of your body until the partner 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.209
 lead her to the next item 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 while the partner is waiting for weight 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.959
 the partner will not be on the right foot and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.660
