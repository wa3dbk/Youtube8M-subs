00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.290
Single time swing.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.900
Single time swing is a very fast rhythm for
swing.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.860
It's when the music is so fast that you can't
triple step and you can't do the double time,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.740
so all you're going to do is take a slow step.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.240
A slow step is one step for two beats of music,
so you're going to go one, two, then to the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.550
other side, three, four.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.810
If you were going to go ahead and take your
rock stop your rock step would be five, six.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
Five, six.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.810
So you're going to go one, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.160
You could also count that slow, slow, quick,
quick.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.640
If I did it with my right foot I would go
slow, slow, quick quick, slow, slow, quick

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.640
quick.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.420
For a lot of you, you might relate to this
as being kind of like jitterbug, right?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.540
So we're going to go slow, slow, quick quick,
slow, slow, quick quick.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.340
Starting with your left, slow, slow, quick
quick, slow, slow, quick quick.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.129
And remember, a slow step is one step for
two beats of music.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.970
A quick step is one step for one beat of music.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.500
So as I face you one more time, let's start
left.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.340
We go slow, slow, quick quick, slow, slow,
quick quick.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.360
As I start right, slow, slow, quick quick,
slow, slow, quick quick.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.280
So let's go ahead and try single time swing
to music.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:42.600
A-five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:55.930
Slow, slow, quick quick.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.600
Right foot.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.910
So when you're dancing to fast swing music,
single time is the way to go.
