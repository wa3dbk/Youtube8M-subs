00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.810
 hi girls hello to everyone then in 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.180
 this video I wanted to show you one 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.920
 small creation that I succeeded 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.510
 finally to do 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.279
 let's say that my little achievement 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.279
 for a long time I wanted to ask 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 to do this and I succeeded 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.509
 actually I saw someone on the web 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 he thought before me, nevertheless I will 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.860
 I'm glad the creation is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.190
 this one is a necklace with this one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.620
 pendant made by me the pendant is 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.960
 made in a film and then set 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.200
 the crochet cabochon 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 so I managed to embed a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.710
 cab son with crochet hook 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.240
 I had already managed to do the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 cover the pearls well this is the pattern 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.510
 you find it on the internet but mine 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.100
 intention was to succeed 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 set a little boston 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.479
 so I made a commitment I must say 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.549
 the truth this was the first test 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.740
 which I did came to me quite well 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.630
 show time closer to the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.439
 creation so you can see in short 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.939
 where what have I combined then this 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.820
 is the necklace seen a little more from 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.979
 near I show you 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.049
 hoping that the light will accompany me 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.319
 this one was a leader in short, that 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.499
 I made with fimo with the pasta of 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.999
 waste in shades of purple fuchsia white 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.060
 blue etc. 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.850
 after which I made this setting 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 with crochet hook 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.359
 this is the front part this is the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.249
 back part 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.579
 actually the back part I wanted 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:51.259
 close it all though I decided to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.759
 leave it that way because it is still there 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.549
 position behind completely white 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.840
 so it didn't give any kind of problem 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.009
 instead I left it rather in front 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.499
 open to show 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.420
 eventually the colors and there are 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.689
 in short, the technique succeeded very well 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.380
 more or less that of the pearl 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.160
 coated with increases and decreases 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.290
 mentally if someone is interested 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.970
 then I do the tutorial hoping to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.819
 remember how I made it because 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.530
 this was my first test 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.079
 after that I continued processing 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.260
 changing thread and using the thread 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.329
 white made two rounds of high and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.120
 I made them with increases in order to 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:34.019
 create this little let's say how I can 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.040
 say this 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.680
 in short, this tune is like that of waves and 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.349
 I changed the inserted wire again from 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 new purple to do this part of 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.879
 under a little bit longer he added 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.069
 these beads which, in short, could 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.400
 also save money but I felt like they were 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.290
 a little too much we say empty then 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.139
 I saw how we were using beads 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.299
 possibly maybe I would have preferred 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:06.209
 I don't know how to add some pendants 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.730
 the little flower seems to me this is 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.180
 acrylic I don't remember what kind of 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.919
 cellino is in the colors of the fuchs way from 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.230
 recall the fuchsia in gabon e 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.060
 purple instead for more love 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.329
 also violates white to recall the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.919
 white and then finally added a pearl is 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.459
 covered in crochet I did 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:32.609
 I always know I'm out 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.049
 I'm out of the camera and I got it 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.959
 these two cups that fit us 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.540
 own really good then added e 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.220
 this part to put the chain one 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.150
 chain is very very simple since 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.780
 however the pendant is already enough 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.129
 challenging 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.989
 we say that they are very happy with 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.150
 this thing I actually thought I was 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.659
 was the first ever as at 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.970
 usual to her to do this with this 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.129
 what though since many people indeed 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.590
 have indicated me or a site where 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.209
 however, there were already tabs on 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.430
 okay patience for me I'm always the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.930
 first also because I searched from nothing 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.980
 to do this thing and I am very much 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.040
 glad no hope 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.590
 you like this one here 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.609

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.139

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.609
