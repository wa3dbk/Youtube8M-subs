00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.960
 We are going to continue with more topics in this bull today of this 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.290
 Wednesday, January 28, no more than a few years ago the thermal center of 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.490
 Albacete offers a course of mating or swimming for babies 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.260
 which can be attended by all babies with ages 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:30.630
 between 6 and 36 months accompanied by their parents in Qatar draw from 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.540
 this course of matronation they learn to socialize with their parents with 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.540
 his parents and also with other babies 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 what if 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.600
 the baby swimming type mating program 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.839
 was launched in mid-2007 taking advantage of the thermal center and the 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.180
 therapeutic pool with which our city counts 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.800
 because it was valued 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.110
 for the contributions of the professionals themselves with the technicians of the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.980
 municipal sports institute 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 it was a very positive experience 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.650
 not very widespread in the whole of Spain 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.300
 but that allowed as well said the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.880
 in responsible monitor 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 p that the children of 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.250
 Babies between six and 36 months 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.229
 have a series of skills cope with psychomotor abilities 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.800
 and of social relationship 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 efe independently the interaction as he also said between the medium 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.590
 with your family with other babies 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 somehow with babies who are used to 1 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.810
 of departure 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.869
 to what is this world not to live in an environment you can be even similar but 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.300
 that was the fundamental goal of creating this program 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.440
 and is that the benefits for the little ones and their parents 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.520
 innumerable is sought the stimulation of the child in the aquatic environment and that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.609
 socialize 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.569
 p without early stimulation 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.769
 By the way, I showed the introduction of the child in the middle 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.899
 water 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.909
 p an experience 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:18.880
 p 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.399
 you have to at the same time 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.739
 socialist 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.399
 It is an experience where the father ctic-cites since childhood 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.399
 and well, well, 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.409
 percent and as we said at the beginning 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.909
 introduces the child into the quantum world 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.969
 and he has his first experiences 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.889
 although it is a precocious stimulation 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.909
 percent 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.780
 vote estimate the sense that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.289
 moves in 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:43.319
 hakkinen 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.290
 much greater mobility than the child who does not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.119
 that does not come to for quantum activity 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.119
 they learn to 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.879
 the language much earlier 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:53.849
 for that 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.849
 precocious stimulation they have of psychomotor skills 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.450
 the babies and their companions 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.470
 can be from the parents to any other family 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.379
 they enjoy for two months between 18 and 22 sessions on two days a week 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.790
 Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday or one day a week on Fridays 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.819
 of intensity and four months 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.599
 the person attachment the father or the mother or not 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.900
 any person omen fly end 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.429
 the person addiction 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:25.589
 percent 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.059
 is with the baby that moral problem distinctions throughout the program 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.549
 of activities 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 and good many and they are progressing 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.999
 the etap of the elderly is not limited 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.789
 but that of babies 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:46.209
 from 6 to 36 months the quotas vary according to the ages one is six 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.139
 to 18 months and the other 18 to 36 months percent in the trunk 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.239
 oo the groups is usually done between 10 and 12 students 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.530
 believes that by two multiple clearings on board as a 24 character already 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.249
 it starts to be 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.249
 but the normal thing is that there is an influx between 7 and 8 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.330
 the day to day work with the little ones this through classes of um 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.759
 tours by parents 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.069
 in babies 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.679
 the zifio are group classes but finally we work 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:21.590
 double and institutions 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.129
 to parents a 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.529
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:28.560
 the sec addressed to the parents that comes to an end of the activities that we 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.809
 we are proposing 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.809
 at the beginning it is a group form 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.620
 a group methodology 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.520
 p like 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.780
 now the evolution of children is very different 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.379
 because at the end of the course it is usually very 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:43.190
 teaching 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.620
 very individualized 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.490
 what about us the monitors 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.389
 we give instructions to the father 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.900
 and each one has a different purpose at the same time as this swimming program for 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.460
 babies 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.160
 there is another albacete for pregnant women that has been launched 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.000
 recently a program that can help to lead a better pregnancy 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.849
 with the guarantees of improving 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.639
 in a habitat as is the aquatic 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.949
 this type of pool and this type of exercises 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.349
 they were positive for pregnancy 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.069
 nor the pregnancy of the woman 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.569
 the good goal is to work 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.550
 decreases the pressure of cunha vertebral improves the mobility of the pregnant 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.490
 and above all especially I believe that the benefit they have percent up 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.169
 100 to kill 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.670
 after childbirth tinam 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.819
 much better recovery 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.289
 work with pregnant women is focused on mobility and work 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.230
 strengthening of abdominals 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.800
 of discharges of the spine 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.279
 as well as the improvement of your cardiorespiratory system 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.369
 in this pulse there is no limit in the gestation time but this is a 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:54.719
 recommendation that the gynecologist must make 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.679
 both one and another course are in great demand by society 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.039
 Albacete 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.440
 so that when it was launched there were 80 places 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.390
 which then became more than four hundred seventy and currently 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.690
 we have 680 places in those different courses 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.009
 or of 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.650
 two months that each of them has say 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.430
 I have been increasing in a very important way the offer we make 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.689
 because there is a great demand 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.849
 an offer that this next year will have to be increased 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.669
 a circumstance of which the councilor of sports rejoices since the 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.709
 new generations will have a plus of love for sport 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.699
 although it is true that from this the ages of six months to 18 to 36 months 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:41.199
 either habitual to the medium 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.009
 gives the aquatic environment in this case i ap healthy habits such as 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.159
 exercise 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.009
 in this case of swimming 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.099
 then I think it's going to be a breeding ground 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.889
 so there is great 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.069
 the use or that great 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:00.929
 boludeo that great volume of d the novel detects him to throw the sport as the 

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:05.150
 generation is that they just started this one was increased from a 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:06.099
 way 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:09.839
 we hope that we will be able to provide services throughout the 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.770
 last years 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.090
 well in the thermal center there are many 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.410
 entities maybe some Turkish cloths solarium jacuzzi spy the pool 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.880
 therapeutic with elements that allow inside the water to do physical exercise 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.020
 a center with great benefits with prices 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.479
 very economical 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:28.930
 a place where madrid 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.500
 Parents the coe feel comfortable and like fish 

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:01.039
 Well, if they complained, there was not one of these babies that would cry 

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.270
 would like to be in the water on the contrary 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.410
 everyone is very happy and with it the flag when they were finished 

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.520
 the class and had before coming back here
