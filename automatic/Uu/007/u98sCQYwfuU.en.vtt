00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 tells crowd then guys are talking 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.469
 here in another video 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.620
 today I need to solve a problem that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.960
 many people have that it is a mistake in which 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 unable to detect if al pb dot net 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.029
 or it also appears on the screen that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.070
 also the daughter- in- law try the game and you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.650
 can be banned many times so I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.099
 I find an easy way to fix it is the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.200
 you download this program 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.180
 hotspot shield 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.739
 When you find him, how will we do it? 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 it will be the support of child 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.690
 7, but you're going to have to come here. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 I'm going to come here, you 're in Salvador. 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:02.359
 speak of the average was very easy you go 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:06.060
 download and run the install of the next 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:10.560
 these very easy things 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:15.720
 the next only this 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.930
 I'm going to close here and close today 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.970
 end looks like this looks like another 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 time will try to connect you have to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.250
 do if you have giving error yet you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.420
 create connect will wait a little goes 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.369
 get ready updating that protection 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.450
 wait a little bit there it will appear 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 this page 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.970
 ready is already protected in layers 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 Did you change your team or are you now? 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.299
 the pine is not very good either 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 What do you have to do? 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:53.670
 You open your league here and it will be 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.100
 everything normal and almost I think impossible 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.960
 make a mistake and that's right when you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.409
 have you will play 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.750
 You'll start playing when you start. 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.009
 a iva screen will look like it is with 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.200
 400 ping 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.200
 When you start the game, you go there and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.750
 and how much to play normal when the match 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.080
 end 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.970
 maybe it will give there is your logo program 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.680
 will close itself will not or will not 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 Can you connect to Chad and you? 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.720
 closure league connects new open 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.870
 usually have an hour when 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.970
 nat connect the pim the ipÃª will if it is 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.180
 restored and you will not need to do 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.710
 this is almost never simpler and 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.040
 I will also leave a preview that 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.880
 any of these days I 'll teach how 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.760
 I'm going to leave it just like everyone and being 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.670
 he and the wallpaper without needing 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.070
 download very very cool because what 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.410
 seems every month and a quality 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.320
 good school 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:09.460
 until the next day to feel the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.830
 people see each other 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.130

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.130
