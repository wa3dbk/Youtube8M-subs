00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.000
 put them weird and so let's see what 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.620
 so well or how bad it is not going to see if yes 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.280
 the investment was good or in this case 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:17.120
 It was very good with very good things 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.540
 around east west of here 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.460
 It is about 6 keys 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.750
 more or less 66 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.080
 and I have invested about four 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.860
 exaggerating five keys 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.189
 I came out winning this is the one here and I 'm not 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.939
 Very safe but I think it's about 460 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.270
 grounds 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:44.490
 yes because the pack of the blankets with this 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.240
 they sell it to 16 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.220
 the blankets are 66 this will be more or 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.840
 minus 4 casey less and recover 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.330
 completely my investment and I left 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.889
