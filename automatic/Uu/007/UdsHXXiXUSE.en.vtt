00:02:57.440 --> 00:04:35.480 

your<00:02:58.440> flashers<00:03:06.620> large<00:03:07.620> multi<00:03:08.370> vortex<00:03:08.849> tornado

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.309 

still<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.849> ground<00:04:37.150> not<00:04:37.599> condensed<00:04:38.169> all

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
still on the ground not condensed all

00:04:38.319 --> 00:05:15.330 
still on the ground not condensed all
the<00:04:38.470> way<00:04:38.620> but<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:38.979> still<00:04:39.039> on<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.460> ground

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:26.020 

oh<00:05:15.419> boy<00:05:17.010> satellite<00:05:18.010> behind<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:21.210> yeah

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.670 

Multi<00:05:27.030> vortex<00:05:27.509> tornado<00:05:27.690> with<00:05:28.169> the<00:05:28.259> satellite

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
Multi vortex tornado with the satellite

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.180 
Multi vortex tornado with the satellite
behind<00:05:29.009> it

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:45.760 

and<00:05:36.810> credible

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.320 

it's<00:05:46.770> over<00:05:47.010> top<00:05:47.220> of<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.430> trees<00:05:47.700> so<00:05:47.730> we<00:05:48.000> can't

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
it's over top of the trees so we can't

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.120 
it's over top of the trees so we can't
be<00:05:48.510> see<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.930> debris<00:05:49.140> but<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.680> part<00:05:49.950> of<00:05:50.070> the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
be see the debris but that part of the

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
be see the debris but that part of the
problem<00:05:50.340> in<00:05:50.670> this<00:05:50.790> area<00:05:54.170> yeah<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.970> one

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
problem in this area yeah that one

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.820 
problem in this area yeah that one
behind<00:05:57.360> it<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.810> bigger<00:05:58.050> now<00:05:58.290> than<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.590> front

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
behind it is bigger now than the front

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:15.850 
behind it is bigger now than the front
one<00:05:59.010> was<00:06:02.030> high<00:06:03.030> it's<00:06:03.300> still<00:06:03.540> there<00:06:03.750> ah

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.120 

probably<00:06:16.860> head<00:06:17.430> south<00:06:17.700> and<00:06:17.730> head<00:06:18.090> east
