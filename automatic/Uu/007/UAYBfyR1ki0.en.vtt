00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.100 
see can I jump on the enemies walk into
it<00:00:42.540> though<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.880> don't<00:00:44.910> kill<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it though and I don't kill it and I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.320

and you notice also there's scores that
flow<00:01:02.120> up<00:01:02.270> from<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.570> enemies<00:01:02.840> when<00:01:02.990> you<00:01:03.080> kill

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
flow up from the enemies when you kill

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.720 
flow up from the enemies when you kill
them<00:01:03.410> that's<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:04.190> other<00:01:04.280> thing<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.580> that

so my zooming 7but XY what message is
and<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.320> life<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.770> message<00:01:19.100> that's<00:01:19.310> so

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
it's forever you do it every frame of

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's forever you do it every frame of
the<00:01:23.479> game<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.530> will<00:01:24.680> reduce<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.100> life<00:01:25.250> by<00:01:25.580> one

keys still work as well I've shared some

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.309 
keys still work as well I've shared some
code<00:02:49.520> between<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.390> level<00:02:50.750> editor<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
code between the level editor in the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.100 
code between the level editor in the
game<00:02:51.470> engine<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:51.940> I've<00:02:52.940> got<00:02:53.180> code<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.050> you

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
game engine so I've got code that you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.040 
game engine so I've got code that you
share<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.709> include<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.000> include<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
share you include it so include just

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.490 
share you include it so include just
tells<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.410> put<00:02:57.620> another<00:02:57.890> file<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:59.500> weather

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
tells it to put another file in weather

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.740 
tells it to put another file in weather
commanders<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.700> that's<00:03:01.910> including<00:03:02.300> types<00:03:02.540> if

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
commanders so that's including types if

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.930 
commanders so that's including types if
I<00:03:02.810> could<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.020> typed<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.380> baby<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.610> just<00:03:04.640> puts

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
I could have typed up baby it just puts

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.530 
I could have typed up baby it just puts
types<00:03:05.209> in<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:06.040> both<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.280> level<00:03:07.790> editor<00:03:07.939> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
types in that both the level editor and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.649 
types in that both the level editor and
the<00:03:08.629> game<00:03:08.810> use<00:03:09.799> enemy<00:03:10.129> type<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.209> they<00:03:11.480> both

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
the game use enemy type so they both

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.790 
the game use enemy type so they both
benefit<00:03:12.019> from<00:03:12.170> that

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
benefit from that

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.350 
benefit from that
flow<00:03:13.010> message<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.490> only<00:03:13.640> used<00:03:13.850> by<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> game

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
flow message is only used by the game

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.810 
flow message is only used by the game
that's<00:03:15.170> not<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.500> important

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
that's not so important

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.910 
that's not so important
one<00:03:17.600> more<00:03:17.810> important<00:03:18.140> one<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.470> load<00:03:18.650> map

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
one more important one is the load map

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.000 
one more important one is the load map
code<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.030> go<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.990> load<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> map<00:03:21.500> it's<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.800> same

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
code so go to load the map it's the same

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.190 
code so go to load the map it's the same
as<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.520> editor<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.210> game<00:03:23.390> stop

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
as in the editor is it in the game stop

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.300 
as in the editor is it in the game stop
to<00:03:24.290> split<00:03:24.530> off<00:03:24.710> into<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.100> file<00:03:25.570> say<00:03:26.570> both<00:03:26.840> now

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
to split off into one file say both now

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.860 
to split off into one file say both now
just<00:03:28.310> call<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:29.200> load<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.320> map<00:03:31.390> let<00:03:32.390> me<00:03:32.480> find<00:03:32.720> it

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
just call a load the map let me find it

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.920 
just call a load the map let me find it
yeah<00:03:33.710> load<00:03:34.310> map<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.350> same<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:38.120> there

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.850

all<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.530> what<00:04:35.530> I've<00:04:35.620> not<00:04:35.800> done<00:04:35.950> yet<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:36.790> I

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
all right what I've not done yet is I

all right what I've not done yet is I
haven't<00:04:37.060> made<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.240> enemies<00:04:37.510> move<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:41.650> is

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
haven't made the enemies move this is

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.470 
haven't made the enemies move this is
gonna<00:04:42.010> be<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.160> longer-term<00:04:42.490> thing<00:04:42.970> because

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
gonna be a longer-term thing because

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.090 
gonna be a longer-term thing because
you've<00:04:44.230> got<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.440> think<00:04:44.530> about<00:04:44.770> how<00:04:44.920> they're

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
you've got to think about how they're

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.470 
you've got to think about how they're
going<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.250> work<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.580> mean<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:45.820> can't<00:04:46.030> make<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.270> move

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
going to work I mean I can't make a move

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.660 
going to work I mean I can't make a move
to<00:04:46.660> move<00:04:46.870> nothing<00:04:47.080> right<00:04:47.440> because<00:04:47.740> they'll<00:04:48.640> be

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
to move nothing right because they'll be

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.700 
to move nothing right because they'll be
floating<00:04:49.180> about<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.450> level<00:04:49.780> but<00:04:50.320> moving<00:04:50.650> off

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
floating about the level but moving off

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.840 
floating about the level but moving off
the<00:04:50.860> edge<00:04:50.950> of<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.160> level<00:04:51.400> will<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.610> going

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
the edge of the level will get going

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.550 
the edge of the level will get going
through<00:04:52.000> tiles<00:04:52.420> so<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.050> enemy's<00:04:53.290> going<00:04:53.440> the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
through tiles so the enemy's going the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.320 
through tiles so the enemy's going the
collision<00:04:54.070> detection<00:04:54.100> as<00:04:54.610> well<00:04:54.790> stop<00:04:55.210> them

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
collision detection as well stop them

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.900 
collision detection as well stop them
walk<00:04:55.450> into<00:04:55.720> tiles<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.590> also<00:04:57.340> something

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
walk into tiles and also something

dropping off lifts and I said the type

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.020 
dropping off lifts and I said the type
of<00:04:59.890> enemies<00:05:00.220> which<00:05:00.430> are<00:05:00.580> meant<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.850> drop

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.950 
hopefully slot mushrooms and meriones
sort<00:05:02.920> of<00:05:02.980> thing<00:05:03.270> might<00:05:04.270> also<00:05:04.420> want<00:05:04.630> enemies

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
sort of thing might also want enemies

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
are my name's can fly my sort of thing

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.270 
are my name's can fly my sort of thing
so<00:05:07.350> really<00:05:08.350> I'm<00:05:08.440> going<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.590> do<00:05:08.890> a<00:05:08.950> separate

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
so really I'm going to do a separate

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.350 
so really I'm going to do a separate
design<00:05:09.370> document<00:05:09.880> just<00:05:10.000> for<00:05:10.120> having<00:05:10.210> a

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
design document just for having a

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.510 
design document just for having a
musical<00:05:10.660> work<00:05:10.900> it's<00:05:11.800> quite<00:05:11.980> common<00:05:12.160> lot<00:05:12.430> of

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
musical work it's quite common lot of

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.820 
musical work it's quite common lot of
games<00:05:12.700> when<00:05:13.030> you've<00:05:13.150> got<00:05:13.300> either<00:05:14.020> a<00:05:14.170> AO

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
games when you've got either a AO

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.420 
games when you've got either a AO
involve<00:05:15.370> controlling<00:05:16.030> enemies<00:05:16.300> or<00:05:16.570> just<00:05:17.430> any

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
involve controlling enemies or just any

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.740 
involve controlling enemies or just any
kind<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.700> movement<00:05:18.940> that<00:05:19.180> isn't<00:05:19.450> done<00:05:19.570> by<00:05:19.600> the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
kind of movement that isn't done by the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.410 
kind of movement that isn't done by the
player<00:05:20.020> it's<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.010> lot<00:05:21.130> harder<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.460> keep<00:05:22.090> track

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
player it's a lot harder to keep track

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.780 
player it's a lot harder to keep track
of<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.930> keep<00:05:23.170> it<00:05:23.290> looking<00:05:23.350> all<00:05:23.650> I'll<00:05:24.580> try

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
of it and keep it looking all I'll try

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.460 
of it and keep it looking all I'll try
and<00:05:24.880> do<00:05:24.940> that<00:05:25.060> for<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.240> next<00:05:25.330> session<00:05:25.570> I'm

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
and do that for the next session I'm

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.080 
and do that for the next session I'm
gonna<00:05:26.650> ask<00:05:26.740> some<00:05:26.890> weapons<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.640> was<00:05:27.940> just

sprite sheets from sprites this is also

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.470 
sprite sheets from sprites this is also
important<00:06:09.130> as<00:06:09.370> far<00:06:09.610> as<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.820> engine<00:06:09.970> goes<00:06:10.300> as

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
important as far as the engine goes as

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.020 
important as far as the engine goes as
well<00:06:10.690> because<00:06:11.140> only<00:06:12.070> chair<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.610> make<00:06:12.730> any<00:06:12.910> kind

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
of game of this really so more

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.280 
of game of this really so more
can<00:06:16.240> specifying<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.720> map<00:06:16.840> edits<00:06:17.140> other

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
can specifying the map edits other

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.050 
can specifying the map edits other
better

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
better

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.890 
better
I've<00:06:19.060> already<00:06:19.210> included<00:06:19.660> things<00:06:19.810> like

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
I've already included things like

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.100 
I've already included things like
gravity<00:06:20.380> and<00:06:20.620> drum<00:06:20.800> height<00:06:21.540> in<00:06:22.540> there<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:23.020> the

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
gravity and drum height in there in the

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.820 
gravity and drum height in there in the
map<00:06:23.260> file<00:06:24.270> and<00:06:25.270> also<00:06:25.570> added<00:06:26.260> an<00:06:26.320> animated

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
map file and also added an animated

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.310 
map file and also added an animated
sprites<00:06:27.220> animated<00:06:27.910> animated<00:06:28.570> tiles<00:06:28.960> as<00:06:29.110> well

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
sprites animated animated tiles as well

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.690 
sprites animated animated tiles as well
so<00:06:29.470> you<00:06:29.560> can<00:06:29.650> have<00:06:29.740> plugins<00:06:30.010> in<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.250> wind<00:06:30.490> and

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
so you can have plugins in the wind and

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.350 
so you can have plugins in the wind and
water<00:06:31.830> moving<00:06:32.830> windmills<00:06:33.670> going<00:06:34.000> around<00:06:34.180> in

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
water moving windmills going around in

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.080 
water moving windmills going around in
the<00:06:34.420> background<00:06:34.570> or<00:06:34.900> something<00:06:36.090> that's

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
the background or something that's

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.460 
the background or something that's
pointed<00:06:37.510> shape<00:06:37.720> and<00:06:38.200> add<00:06:38.400> ground

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
pointed shape and add ground

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.320 
pointed shape and add ground
graphics<00:06:41.700> that's<00:06:42.700> just<00:06:42.880> gonna<00:06:43.000> be<00:06:43.090> child

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
graphics that's just gonna be child

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.670 
graphics that's just gonna be child
images<00:06:43.750> you<00:06:43.870> can<00:06:43.990> add<00:06:44.140> in<00:06:44.260> the<00:06:44.320> background

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
images you can add in the background

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.620
