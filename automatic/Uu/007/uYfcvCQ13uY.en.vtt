00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.810
 thousand ways to tell the same story 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.630
 one story can be counted one thousand 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.420
 ways is true but a story that 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.490
 matter an authentic story 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.619
 literarily speaking he only has one 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.020
 appropriate tone that should come from the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.020
 inside of the story itself and you have to 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.580
 I find it sometimes takes years as 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.529
 it happened to garcÃ­a marquez until 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 found the tone of 100 years of loneliness 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 I was looking for 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.650
 sometimes the tone of a writing can be 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 formal as the administrative language 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.030
 where the laws other times can be 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 colloquially imitating the speech that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.100
 used in the family or between friends or 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.320
 scientific where it's about communicating 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.900
 some objective data from 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 research carried out or poetic 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.180
 letting ourselves be carried away by the music of the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 words there are many but what is 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.940
 Of course, each text requires a tone 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.790
 determined we can not write a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.670
 nevada judicial in poetic tone nor a 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.570
 declaration of love in formal tone 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.320
 good administrative unless 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.780
 let's have humorous intentions 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.720
 but to find a suitable tone to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.200
 a story first we must be able 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.540
 to use different expressive tones 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.580
 that is the goal of this video what 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.670
 normal is that we are used to a 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.910
 only record in the script once 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.369
 is colloquial or formal but we must 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.680
 be able to distinguish and issue a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.740
 same message with different intentions 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.800
 for example if I wanted to write with 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.110
 different shades the phrase emilio like 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.320
 too much I could do it the next 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.000
 mode 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.880
 in colloquial form emilio is a cumin 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.660
 Intellectually Emilio is a gourmet 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.229
 insatiable in formal tone 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:01.320
 emilio ingests an excess of food in 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.080
 dismissive tone Emilio will end up like 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.260
 a tallow ball 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.009
 and I'm sure Emilio has 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.009
 a good appetite 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 competitive 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.750
 in a corny tone, Emilio's voracity is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.750
 disproportionate 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.870
 in technical tone Emilio's intake 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.909
 exceeds your caloric needs 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.519
 unless you always limit yourself to 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.379
 write a monotonous and monotonous journal 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.780
 you will have to use different 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.060
 narrative records if you write a 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.049
 story where several characters act 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.569
 each one 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.329
 he will need to express himself with his own voice 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.129
 with its particular idiolecto unless 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.950
 all are cut by the same pattern 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.950
 that are indistinguishable clones some of 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.019
 others and each story or novel will need 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.870
 of a narrator suited to the 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.340
 intentions of one 's own history can 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.790
 that you find more comfortable writing 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.829
 in a certain tone either because it's 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.049
 closest to your personal tone or of 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.200
 communication or because you have not practiced 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.079
 more often but if you limit yourself 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.970
 to always use the same tone on 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.120
 same record and the same point of view 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.329
 you will be condemned to always write the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.849
 same story or as little observe and 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.640
 transmit your image of the world from a 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.670
 only optics repeating yourself to yourself 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.770
 to infinity 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.530
 nobody forbids you to do it of course 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.620
 but it can be so boring 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.380
 how to attend the concert again and again 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.270
 of piano in the interpreter uses a 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.110
 only finger a single octave and 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.840
 eighth notes 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.520
 there are authors that surprise us book 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.800
 after book with new ways of 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.720
 writing to the point that it seems that 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.120
 they will lock themselves into several 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.830
 Writers Camilo Jose Cela for example 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.650
 It is a clear case of writing 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.720
 chameleonic the trip to the alcarria the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.670
 secret dictionary in the beehive the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.490
 paschal family duarte trade of 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.710
 darkness 5 christ versus arizona no 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.240
 they are written by the same author in 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.520
 margin that we like or do not like 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.280
 the writing or his characters or he 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.380
 personally you will have to recognize him 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.390
 merit of risking and exploring new 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.480
 roads even at the cost of your mouth is in 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.950
 some narrative experiments like that in 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.020
 the search for the tone of the 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.820
 differentiation and the practice of 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.070
 different points of view 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.570
 grant a personal style to your 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.400
 narrations 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.919
 to have a style of its own is not to write 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.740
 always on the same issues or the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.560
 neither is writing such and 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.900
 how you speak or express yourself to others 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.910
 GarcÃ­a Marquez one of the best 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.910
 exponents of the periodic style and 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.700
 cut has been able to move between the world 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.340
 of magical realism 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.290
 in that of the fictionalized novel without 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.990
 need to lose the essence of what 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.720
 literary his stories has a style 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.540
 own but the style does not have to 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.120
 dilate the writer unless it is 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.940
 its sole purpose 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.530
 I recommend reading to Italo Calvino 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.290
 specifically his novel if a night of 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.380
 winter a traveler in that novel 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.300
 Calvin contains many novels and each 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.160
 chapter seems to be written by a 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.040
 different author is an exercise of 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.050
 narrative style not yet passed the 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.370
 protagonist of the story is also 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.290
 surprising because it's about the reader 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.240
 when at the end of the 20th century it seemed 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.800
 that it was no longer possible to provide new 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.199
 techniques that will amaze anyone with the 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.570
 Italo calvino writing gets 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.699
 dazzle not only the critics but 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.070
 also to the writers themselves a 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.370
 indispensable book that deserves several 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.180
 readings 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.880
 and now write to write between 3 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.940
 and 5 short exercises that can be 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.699
 as a mathematical formula a recipe 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.590
 of kitchen in threat tone the removed 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.500
 by the driver of a bus for a 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.330
 extraterrestrial in the form of good romance 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.530
 I'm sure you can think of many more 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.540
 Surprising possibilities surprise us you 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.639
 Try also with a scene from 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.370
 some story of yours that you already have written 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.889
 become several writers who 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.650
 they use technical records and all the 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.199
 different tell us the same story 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.840
 again and again exploring several 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.150
 possibilities 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.520
