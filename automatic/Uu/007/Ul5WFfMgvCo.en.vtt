00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 nice that you are back in mine 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.550
 Although the next murder conception is possible 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.820
 here around this beautiful square miles 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.549
 loading so you can find the shop and that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.130
 under the mods and the area 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.800
 front loader and theresa press load and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 square ball 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.390
 you can say konrad with that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 take up only a whopping 500 euros 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.910
 and 10 euros a day below well I have 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.369
 you to talk to the teller it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.469
 made one of our beautiful liebherr 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 I already pressed both of them 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.440
 painful and so you had to now 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.480
 actually only more if you have a look 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 Show the help close in on the ball 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.170
 you could adjust a bit 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.530
 so you just pick up a bit 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.559
 were nice and actually only 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.539
 the thought ex pressed and let up and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.140
 that does not work because we do not appear 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 properly locked so completely after 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 below 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.290
 the dx and he grabbed you one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 It also looks like a great animation 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.610
 and you have the ball fixed 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.610
 could now somewhere on the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.740
 followers and again the tics push the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.290
 claws would go out and want there 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.960
 We would be free again, too 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.060
 company will drive you backwards 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.060
 this is the way it is 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.760
 first ickx and then ex said again 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.870
 rows of teeth we can pick up 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.910
 it worked so far so far 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.420
 the pressure works again a lok 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.640
 the lok is completely error free massive 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.979
 where there are still flags at the top 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.500
 namely missing and which button 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.210
 Claw missing so was two , however 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.310
 I still have almost no one in it 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.850
 does not see what they believe are bad 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.520
 but okay, there they are often you have them 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.690
 recognized about good then I want to say that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.770
 It was with the mouse presentation 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.509
 hopefully we will see that in the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.509
 The next one will do well until then
