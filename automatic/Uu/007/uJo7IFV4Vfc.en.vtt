00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 higher wider and more variable than its 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.019
 he should be predecessor 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.679
 bmw's smallest suv x1 comes in new 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.599
 format 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.059
 The Bavarians also break with this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.430
 model again in rows taboo and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 maybe shake again 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 hardcore brand fans with largely 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.840
 similar technology as the active tour 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.050
 follows with the x1 the next one goes yet 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.570
 not from bmw from the wonderful alps 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
 panorama shows us bmw the new x1 and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.649
 rarely was never really right here 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.120
 because of the rear wheel drive of the predecessor 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.010
 switch to front-wheel drive 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.579
 this includes the technology of the active 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.410
 Gates 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.149
 that is, there is all the good that is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.180
 new generation of the car is 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.860
 This car is also more spacious 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.129
 the scale for audi q3 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.520
 Let's see who has the nose here 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.410
 The optics check completes the new x1 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.690
 he stretches the broad ones without hesitation 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 in the wind slightly angular advice 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.809
 necklines and stout shoulders 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.140
 send the signal 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.180
 Here comes a real suv the boxy one 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 stern and high sheet flanks he fight 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.250
 against the popularity differ 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 but clearly from the coupe-like audi q3 the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 bmw wants to be a practitioner not just a pose 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
 that confirms the interior of the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.150
 Forget your skinny predecessor 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 piano lacquer and matthis alu decor 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 strive for premium that lures 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 display stands firmly in the cockpit 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.460
 traditionally turned back to the driver 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 bmw has the nose in front 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.689
 especially the e3 switch between the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 sitting is better in the hand 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.189
 The climate is in the center console 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.890
 Conveniently higher than in the regulator 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.740
 active tourer an additional stock 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.350
 with rollo offers even more space in the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.869
 For example, x1 and q3 are different 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.670
 hardware store and boutique while big 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.770
 people in the audi through a narrow 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.409
 Squeeze door on the tight back seat 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.990
 you have to beat in the bmw thanks 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.259
 sliding back seat for 250 euros 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.119
 extra legs loose on each other too 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 in the trunk of the x1 have the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.129
 Developer packed in all the good ideas 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.020
 double bottom no loading edge and the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.580
 Backrests fall off by lever 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.140
 behind 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.370
 with a size of 505 to 1550 liters 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.470
 Deaf the x1 even as a removal helper 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.880
 questionable with the old x1 makes bmw on 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.240
 cannibal quantity better the quality 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.740
 Right 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.440
 the service is simple and catchy 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.110
 So where is still my opinion 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.520
 after steering in a pretty sharp direction i 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.170
 would only have had a little more power 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.380
 if it should be because only sporty 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.260
 the automatic is one of his eight gear 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.750
 I was always awake so it must be and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.070
 to the turbo the oboist to the sound 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.580
 at least maybe the bmw 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.080
 expected the suspension is allowed says 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.330
 a bit much order but he gives 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.880
 in the result, nevertheless, a splendid 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.310
 comfort and that's what makes this car so 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.460
 versatile character is still for 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.940
 Furore is the power of ours 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.220
 testwagens is at 231 ps the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.630
 top speed at 235 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.000
 hours kilometers 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.500
 from zero to one hundred this x1 needs 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.020
 65 seconds 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.990
 its consumption should be at 6.4 liters 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.970
 priced , it starts at 42,500 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.730
 Euro 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.760
 the q3 has a 65 centimeter 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.470
 shorter wheelbase than the x1 and that does 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.980
 the partie sent 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.390
 He is actually a 2 + 2 seater 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.640
 That's why it stays on the back seat 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 little room for your knees in the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.160
 So, 185 liters fit into the luggage compartment 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.500
 suitcase and a bag less inside 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.080
 as in the he almost 460 to 1365 liters 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.930
 in the cockpit the audi shows on flights and 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.570
 solid processing the x1 water after 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.970
 the display still goes up at the top 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.280
 with a half page out future 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.740
 audi do not have that with the 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.770
 driving characteristics, the q3 plays that 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.590
 adrenaline june personally hold that 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.840
 audi q3 in the driving program on dynamic then 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.400
 his character comes out best this 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.290
 auto talks I riders a 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.630
 is a bit clearer on the turbo 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.090
 Present I find performance comes too 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.160
 a bit more direct which unfortunately not 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.280
 the gearbox fits this 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.560
 Seven-speed s tronic sometimes 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.350
 a little delayed switches or too 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.470
 gets hectic and the sitting position too 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.510
 after the facelift are on the q3 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.040
 city ​​in it 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.630
 I really dare to do that 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.900
 directly noticed our q3 has 220 ps 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.020
 and is at 233 km in the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.810
 tip slightly slower than the x1 for that 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.330
 he sprints with 64 seconds a breath 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.240
 faster on the 100 the consumption of 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.460
 audi is 6.6 liters super something 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.180
 higher than the bmw with a 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.180
 entry price of 41,000 100 euro 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.910
 he cheaper than the x1 of the audi 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.780
 q3 is considered suv coupé and why it is 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.730
 Closer looks a bit closer 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.020
 Sporty also the motor feels 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.510
 more crisp on 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.300
 but what he misses for good luck is missing 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.090
 owns the new bmw x1 as please bmw 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.200
 and broadband yes probably a roomier 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.780
 interior superior 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.820
 automatic transmission and a suspension of 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.700
 I say that makes some bmw x3 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.250
 superfluous, of course, no cheap 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.590
 enjoy more than 4000 euros more expensive than the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.210
 audi q3 and still those are good 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.790
 prospects for bmw at least in the of 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.370
 Running sport of the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.890
 x1 is the price difference to the audi so 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.960
 big bmw is still allowed in the 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.970
 average up to five percent more 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.420
 ask for as the ingolstädter for 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.060
 comparable q3 for this is the new x1 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:55.060
 but surprisingly fit everyday and can 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.850
 Everything is better than its predecessor 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.420
 he also the sportier audi q3 old 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.420
 appearance
