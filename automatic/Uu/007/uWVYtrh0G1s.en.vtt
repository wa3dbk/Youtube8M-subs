so yeah um just from a sheer sound

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.060 
so yeah um just from a sheer sound
perspective<00:04:18.199> which<00:04:18.320> is<00:04:18.470> hard<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.769> tell<00:04:19.040> on

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
perspective which is hard to tell on

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.039 
perspective which is hard to tell on
camera<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.030> something<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.299> want<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.840> try

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
camera so it's something you want to try

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.860 
camera so it's something you want to try
personnel<00:04:22.040> viously<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:23.360> don't<00:04:23.570> know

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
personnel viously and I don't know

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.370 
personnel viously and I don't know
whether<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.320> one's<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.680> fluke<00:04:25.010> in<00:04:25.580> terms<00:04:25.940> of

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
whether this one's a fluke in terms of

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.620 
whether this one's a fluke in terms of
had<00:04:27.380> any<00:04:27.590> other<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:27.979> these<00:04:28.160> models<00:04:28.699> in<00:04:29.330> stock

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630

had any other of these models in stock
from<00:04:30.139> Adele<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:30.680> it's<00:04:30.860> hard<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.100> say<00:04:31.220> whether

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
from Adele so it's hard to say whether

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.140 
from Adele so it's hard to say whether
it's<00:04:32.600> just<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.990> really<00:04:33.260> nice<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:33.680> but<00:04:34.400> i<00:04:34.639> know<00:04:34.790> i
