combination portion and valve plumbing

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.940 
combination portion and valve plumbing
it<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.150> master<00:03:14.720> cylinder<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:15.470> then

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
it to the master cylinder and then

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.400 
it to the master cylinder and then
running<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.790> brake<00:03:17.090> light<00:03:17.390> switch<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.110> all

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
running a brake light switch so all

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.800 
running a brake light switch so all
these<00:03:18.650> are<00:03:18.890> available<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:20.030> component

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
these are available on this component
