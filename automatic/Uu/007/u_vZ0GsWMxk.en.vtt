00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.400 
start off just the colors that they come
in<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.359> mean<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.660> think<00:00:18.720> there's<00:00:19.080> something<00:00:19.230> like

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
in I mean I think there's something like

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990 
in I mean I think there's something like
10<00:00:19.710> colors<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> different

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
10 colors you have all the different

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.540 
10 colors you have all the different
ones<00:00:21.150> Purple's<00:00:21.720> blues<00:00:21.810> greens<00:00:22.619> reds<00:00:23.189> yellows

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
ones Purple's blues greens reds yellows

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.620 
ones Purple's blues greens reds yellows
White's<00:00:24.410> everything<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.029> for<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.090> price<00:00:27.269> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
White's everything and for a price of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
White's everything and for a price of
ten<00:00:28.140> dollars<00:00:28.590> they're<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.160> bad<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.490> all

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
ten dollars they're not that bad at all

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
ten dollars they're not that bad at all
I<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> UM<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.449> chords<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> little

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I think the UM the chords are a little

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.430 
I think the UM the chords are a little
small<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.219> kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> flimsy<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:34.020> other<00:00:34.230> than

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
small and kind of flimsy but other than

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.530 
small and kind of flimsy but other than
that<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.980> headphones<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.969> feel<00:00:36.180> better

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that the headphones really feel better

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.869 
that the headphones really feel better
to<00:00:37.440> me<00:00:37.559> personally<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.489> they're<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to me personally I think that they're a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.610 
to me personally I think that they're a
little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.210> better<00:00:39.450> than<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> actual<00:00:40.140> apple

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
little bit better than the actual apple

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
little bit better than the actual apple
headphones<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.280> cost<00:00:41.520> three<00:00:42.329> times<00:00:42.360> as

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
headphones which cost three times as

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.970 
headphones which cost three times as
much<00:00:42.960> um<00:00:44.329> durability<00:00:45.329> wise<00:00:45.690> though<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
much um durability wise though not so

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660 
much um durability wise though not so

loud<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.600> great<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.040> there's<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.250> kind

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
loud it's great for that there's no kind

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600 
loud it's great for that there's no kind
of<00:01:17.880> noise<00:01:18.240> isolation<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.290> anything<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
of noise isolation or anything and that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
of noise isolation or anything and that
because<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.570> only<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.960> ten

dollars but all of that I think that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.940 
dollars but all of that I think that
