00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.069
 the visit to the energy 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.519
 the academic year that goes beyond 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.489
 from there to you 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.929
 and which are in addition to heaven 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.769
 this region launches 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.779
 of the Gulf of Morbihan 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.439
 that's exactly it's a sign of optimism the natural 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.960
 the light changes constantly at work 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'm also careful at hachette but I have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 she all around me 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.760
 because I'm trying to keep the atmosphere of this house of 18 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.150
 160 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.420
 cp heritage is something we need to maintain 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.250
 it's part of ourselves 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 and that's the way to be very attentive 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.230
 with the arrival in return age things things 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 g and these links 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.690
 and to keep the materials 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.440
 the house immediately in the light and has the spring of the year 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.520
 all the houses 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.630
 non eto'o workshops 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 are always white 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.920
 she white and black and for me is very important it's a light 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.420
 and when I go to a blue triptych a damn idea and if it's critical 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.420
 I pay tribute to the color 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.600
 being a kid 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 I have been a little everywhere we will take everywhere 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.100
 and even when I came back to paris and even my mother took great care of 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.110
 send me to museums 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.300
 it's also the teeth in some cities remain 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.120
 and basically all that belongs to me 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.160
 and that's why heritage days are important 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.830
 it's but the doors open 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.120
 as for them at the stop and at the same time to know 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.329
 and it's a free culture 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.169
 it was for everyone 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.169
 it's for everyone and all classes of society 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:17.749
 and it's important
