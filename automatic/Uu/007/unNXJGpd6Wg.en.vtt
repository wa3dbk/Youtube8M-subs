really cool laser shotgun type of thing
that<00:02:25.160> we<00:02:25.400> all<00:02:25.640> would<00:02:25.850> use<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.300> space<00:02:26.600> in<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
that we all would use in space in the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.670 
that we all would use in space in the
25th<00:02:28.280> century<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.840> looks<00:02:29.990> looks<00:02:30.380> like<00:02:30.440> you

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
25th century and it looks looks like you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440 
25th century and it looks looks like you
can<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:30.980> put<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> scope<00:02:31.580> over<00:02:31.730> his<00:02:32.060> eye<00:02:32.210> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
can just put the scope over his eye and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.110 
can just put the scope over his eye and
he<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:33.290> some<00:02:33.530> damage<00:02:33.710> so<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
he can do some damage so that is the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.070 
he can do some damage so that is the
Alpha<00:02:35.480> blade<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.230> totally<00:02:36.770> say<00:02:37.040> get<00:02:37.340> one

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
Alpha blade and I totally say get one

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.470 
Alpha blade and I totally say get one
out<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.440> box<00:02:39.650> crawls<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.460> eye<00:02:40.490> on<00:02:41.060> crap

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
out of the box crawls the eye on crap

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.170
