like<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.350> pmags<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> does<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.720> me

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
like the pmags and what that does for me

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890 
like the pmags and what that does for me
anyway<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.430> mean<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.909> obviously<00:01:39.479> protects

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
anyway is I mean it obviously protects

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.450 
anyway is I mean it obviously protects
the<00:01:39.990> phone<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.409> well<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> covers<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the phone pretty well and covers up and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.149 
the phone pretty well and covers up and
snaps<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
snaps right in but what I like about it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.190 
snaps right in but what I like about it
is<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> trying<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> grab<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> size<00:01:45.990> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
having these little ribs on the side

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
having these little ribs on the side
here<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> make<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.509> easier<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> hold<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
here kind of make it easier to hold and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
here kind of make it easier to hold and
to<00:01:52.530> manipulate<00:01:53.100> without<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> sliding<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to manipulate without a sliding out of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.310 
to manipulate without a sliding out of
your<00:01:54.149> hand<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> stuff<00:01:54.930> and

your hand and all that kind of stuff and
it's<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.610> made<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.600> not

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it's it's kind of made of a it's not

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
it's it's kind of made of a it's not
obviously<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> same<00:01:58.680> hard<00:01:59.340> plastic<00:01:59.759> material

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
obviously the same hard plastic material

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.600 
obviously the same hard plastic material
it's<00:02:00.329> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> softer<00:02:01.079> rubberized<00:02:01.649> not

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it's kind of a softer rubberized not

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.219 
it's kind of a softer rubberized not
totally<00:02:02.969> rubberized<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.570> somewhat

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
totally rubberized but somewhat

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.319 
totally rubberized but somewhat
rubberized<00:02:04.619> material<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> still<00:02:06.180> get

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
rubberized material so you still get

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.940 
rubberized material so you still get
good<00:02:06.619> grip<00:02:07.619> shin<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
good grip shin but it's not so much you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.230 
good grip shin but it's not so much you
know<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.220> still

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
know it's still

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.140 
know it's still
on<00:02:12.450> other<00:02:12.750> material<00:02:13.560> will<00:02:13.770> slide<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:15.060> know

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
on other material will slide you know

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.240 
on other material will slide you know
without<00:02:15.300> grabbing<00:02:15.690> too<00:02:16.080> much<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> think

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
without grabbing too much so I think

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.130 
without grabbing too much so I think
it's<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.550> pretty<00:02:17.670> good<00:02:17.790> combination<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.630> for

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
it's a pretty good combination and for

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.680 
it's a pretty good combination and for
12<00:02:19.440> bucks<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:20.040> mean<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:20.970> 1295

12 bucks I mean you know it's like 1295

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.560 
12 bucks I mean you know it's like 1295
or<00:02:21.990> whatever<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.740> paid<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.250> and

you<00:02:24.570> know<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:26.550> price<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.180> can't<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.540> beat

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
you know that price really can't be beat

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.350
