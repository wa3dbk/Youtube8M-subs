00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:13.739
 you are from one of the bookeen and proposed to you% switch first 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.739
 French eBook loos for ore and here 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.240
 so here it is for 100 euros missing works the show the questions on 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.350
 Islam children 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.640
 that's what's important and the sketches made its originality 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.439
 absolutely so today how does it work 1 it appears like the 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 our 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 for the connection to agree on a pc is in celebration 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380
 we choose his helpers and the durations of documents that we want to be able to return 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.450
 in the device can triumph in what is called dental amalgam it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660
 moved into the device 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.120
 and actually after a new bridge on the threshold of 1000 pages bookstore 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.580
 a page paito library in french 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.910
 % and that actually allows to list all the all the documents she was 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.110
 loaded angry so basically it's a screen that's particular it has nothing to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.819
 see with a computer screen c 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.090
 it's laughable 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.330
 quite actually it's a screen both in teknologik teaser version 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.240
 technologies and papers the chronicles the electronic tag that several 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.410
 benefits a completely open viewing angle 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.210
 % no backlight so it does not tire the eyes for less 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.230
 of five consumes a lot less German paper you have excluded from the 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.800
 accounts are extremely strong 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.130
 extremely light 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.280
 I consume very little have stopped from this device member as strong more 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 end a very light cell phone 30 grams more than 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.930
 and the autonomy option of the order several weeks while we have when 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.300
 same book on this oval internal memory you can put from his book 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.480
 for 64 million internal memory side but if e if you add in fact 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.910
 a sd card you can mount up to 2 gigabytes of memory and so that 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.500
 tens of thousands of cases so I can go on vacation with the whole 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 small biobank without any problem and without having to recharge one no more 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.550
 take to shippers how much it costs 350 euros and all the books 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.780
 cost how much the books actually we find them so on 200 e bookstore 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.980
 as for through the years web 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.550
 and delivers 103-101 which shows for this role the problem is that there is 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.420
 not many French books still in France is still quite limited and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.450
 it's a shame I call the publishers to digitize their content 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.170
 so today we find about 1,500 17 books in readable format for 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.950
 pay back type of device the low wages novels for reinforcement 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.680
 Chronic malus romands have adhered to chicotte one swim marinist friend 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 stephen king but all english 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.099
 in French 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.999
 we are in europe one of the severe penalties that the elegance of the hedgehog 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.529
 gallimard antoine gallimard have made efforts the areas digitization 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.809
 it's one of the few publishing houses that does it 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.439
 % but we have lots of small actors 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.229
 very happy very dynamic in the field kim is a document let them deliver 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.479
 a digital format pro 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.460
 % it will be a lesson of 2008 it is an uproar in australia 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.269
 % and I hope 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.840
 I think because we really make it through 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.640
 in europe we were discussing visitors but also against against nadal customers 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.730
 who you who tell us about their chronic libretto we really feel 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.480
 than 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.560
 the acquisition the reading that of the reading on screen became possible 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.860
 so we've gone a technological way 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.600
 the franchise capcom may not be the definitive device the iphone du du 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.039
 booklet chronically any case 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.089
 we have really taken a step in terms of beauty of the text but there is a lot of 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.559
 people who do not want to hear about the clip who prefer them 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.459
 must we mourn the paper book but it is finally I can say 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.450
 stop an attitude that is completely normal 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.389
 in the beginning 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.339
 in e at the time of the site before took 5 few runners originally aimed at 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.959
 but also on the shareholders' refractory 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.489
 we think that a real attachment to the paper book is quite natural 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.440
 that we have been 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.229
 educated with paper book 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.859
 and so we can talk about it overnight in ten years and didier deschamps 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.579
 to whom we can read on screen of course 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.269
 today% and the consumers of the booklet train to change very big 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.739
 drives for keita that has become a constraint it's a benefit not want 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.389
 say it's not the paper today estimated the document they 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 can read have helped us and 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.849
 for free on very large readers thank you my talents nothing
