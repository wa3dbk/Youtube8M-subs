 you have to pay a lot of attention because here 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.980

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.520
 their houses hear that more you dance apart from 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.649
 everything you have already taught us and rock 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.379

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.500
 well then the water does not dance anymore 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 Arab of all of everything and now yes already 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 They are ready and took air and took 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.079
 a breath that seems to them like 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.770
 called the song that dance this 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.390
 high school confidant a client 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.390
 secondary because we are going to catch them 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.020
 and in my case it's me who calls you 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.710
 and the boys and the girls are 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.220
 they prepare to go dancing 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:16.799
 I can detail it better because this one 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.799
 it arrived was broken for all 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.900
 Here we have three 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.100
 why 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.630
 the seer is me 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.429
 ahead 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.969
 and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.290
 this is very difficult 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.360
 practice the charged ones of those that are and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.050
 Pauline do not come here 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.120
 please I see them and I say let's dance 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 do not let me die now that you want 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.890
 to do this massacre nothing would be charged 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.180
 and nothing but the plain is no safe load 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.690
 after talking to the producer 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.510
 we have a true tradition that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.440
 we want that hope that the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.440
 ice cream dancer 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.380
 hope gives me hope 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.130
 our partner who are in the unit 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.890
 and today is his birthday many people 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:08.880
 where such dances rock hope 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:10.680
 good thing about these dance loads 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.330
 well there's always a first time 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.220
 hope so let's go put 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.900
 attention as is the situation that seems 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.280
 well my dear master gerardo 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.830

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.000
 well in the step bases is also this 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.280
 let's try to make 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.590
 tap 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.709
 ok now as if they brought a guitar 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.980
 they have to do this ok 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.510
 we forget our hands and we do this if 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:46.440
 we can put a little bit of do not take off 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:49.470
 the little time that is now for 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.709
 being able to take the first laps is only 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.140
 two steps for soups and we go back to 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.630
 repeat 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.720

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.640
 checking 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.689
 later 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.620
 we are here 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.129

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.860
 watching the music 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:51.259
 or what I was telling you if it is that 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:55.999
 we must take if it is dividing 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:59.209
 never the step the crisis happened and the girl 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:01.429
 it has to be dropped 

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:02.839
 Let us hold we must 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:04.759
 make a resistance 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.429
 she has to take me from the back and 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.339
 it's going to be back me too but 

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:13.879
 instead of doing this we are going to do this 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:23.950
