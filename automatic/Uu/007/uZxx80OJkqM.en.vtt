I'm just gonna do a quick review on that
Shimano<00:00:06.000> sustaining<00:00:06.779> 5000<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.610> last

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
Shimano sustaining 5000 this is last

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.560 
Shimano sustaining 5000 this is last
year's<00:00:09.780> model<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.290> think<00:00:10.320> but<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.610> picked<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.480> up

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
year's model I think but I picked it up

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.629 
year's model I think but I picked it up
at<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.900> local<00:00:13.230> tackle<00:00:13.559> shop<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.130> 35

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
at my local tackle shop for like 35

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
at my local tackle shop for like 35
percent<00:00:15.059> off<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.780> figured<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> great

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
percent off so I figured it was a great

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.330 
percent off so I figured it was a great
deal<00:00:17.270> it's<00:00:18.270> uh<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:19.199> relatively<00:00:19.740> tiny<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
deal it's uh it's relatively tiny for a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.790 
deal it's uh it's relatively tiny for a
five<00:00:20.580> thousand<00:00:21.000> actually<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:22.050> um<00:00:23.720> holds

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
five thousand actually I think um holds

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.220 
five thousand actually I think um holds
this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.090> 350<00:00:27.090> yards<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:29.420> 15<00:00:30.420> pound<00:00:30.779> spider

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this is 350 yards of a 15 pound spider

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.700 
this is 350 yards of a 15 pound spider
wire<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.669> cast<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:34.380> far<00:00:34.680> as

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
wire and it can cast for up as far as

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
wire and it can cast for up as far as
you<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.399> it'll<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.809> cool

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you want it to go it'll go it's so cool

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
you want it to go it'll go it's so cool
when<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.989> bought<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.280> tech<00:00:41.820> shop<00:00:42.059> was

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
when I bought this the tech shop was

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.729 
when I bought this the tech shop was
trying<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.750> rid<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.989> them<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
trying to get rid of them I got this a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.380 
trying to get rid of them I got this a
couple<00:00:44.010> days<00:00:44.100> ago<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.860> they<00:00:47.090> had<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> on

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
couple days ago and they had this on

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
couple days ago and they had this on
display<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.260> got<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> Box<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.190> found

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
display so when they got the Box I found

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420 
display so when they got the Box I found
that<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> came<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.629> an<00:00:51.750> extra<00:00:51.840> spool<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:53.100> i

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that it came with an extra spool which i

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.540 
that it came with an extra spool which i
think<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.270> an<00:00:54.539> $80.00<00:00:55.020> spool<00:00:55.680> pretty

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
think is like an $80.00 spool pretty

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
think is like an $80.00 spool pretty
cool<00:00:56.730> deal<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.510> came<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.109> bag

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
cool deal it also came with a little bag

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.310 
cool deal it also came with a little bag
that<00:00:58.680> doesn't<00:00:59.399> fit<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.359> real<00:01:00.750> handle<00:01:01.140> on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that doesn't fit with the real handle on

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
that doesn't fit with the real handle on
which<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.039> stupid<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:03.120> no<00:01:03.930> no<00:01:05.330> I've

equation in casting is that from that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.840 
equation in casting is that from that
reel<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.530> another<00:01:43.530> rod<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.430> just

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850

realized I had is my hurricane red boat
it's<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:51.320> seven<00:01:52.320> foot<00:01:52.500> six<00:01:52.530> medium<00:01:53.009> action<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it's the seven foot six medium action so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
it's the seven foot six medium action so
it's<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.930> long<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.860> man

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it's not as long as that one but man

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.149 
it's not as long as that one but man
this<00:01:56.579> thing<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.500> work<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.950> got

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
a pretty good backbone I used to go

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.840 
a pretty good backbone I used to go
grouper<00:02:01.710> fishing<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:03.110> I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
grouper fishing like this actually I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.290 
grouper fishing like this actually I
used<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.540> pence<00:02:07.079> Argos<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:07.979> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
used to have my pence Argos on there and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.760 
used to have my pence Argos on there and
it<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> 5000<00:02:10.410> size<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.250> actually

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it was a 5000 size but it was actually

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:21.350 
it was a 5000 size but it was actually
bigger<00:02:12.070> than<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.910> my<00:02:19.090> circus<00:02:19.810> 5000

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
bigger than so this is my circus 5000

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.550 
bigger than so this is my circus 5000
and<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.320> sustain<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:28.260> which<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.500> you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and this is the sustain so which do you

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.540 
and this is the sustain so which do you
think<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:30.010> bigger

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
think is bigger
