00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.309
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.080
 first real episode of the guide of the 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.520
 pokemon strategy so today we're going 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.289
 talk about pokemon types 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.030
 so to get to the heart of the matter 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.350
 it's these elements that are 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.640
 complete more or less so some 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.350
 types are going to be effective on others and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.300
 Conversely 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.849
 you have 18 type so far that you 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.660
 can see under your eyes 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.490
 these types have sensitivities 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.929
 different from each other some can 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.339
 to be effective on one type but 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.680
 completely useless on others and 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.329
 et cetera and so on 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.220
 so we distinguish six categories of 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.140
 sensitivity you have neutrality the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.030
 weaknesses both blue weaknesses 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.570
 resistances the double resistance and the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.520
 immunities 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.949
 so to distinguish them in the game 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.480
 it's pretty simple so when we take 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.489
 an offensive attack 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.559
 if the screen shows you nothing it wants 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.640
 to say that the damage is neutral if 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.870
 the screen shows you it's great 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.180
 effective it means it's a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.469
 weakness or double weakness when 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.090
 it shows you is not very effective 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.010
 it's a resistance or 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.149
 double resistance and finally 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.500
 when the screen shows you it does not affect 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.839
 not the pokemon and a half is that he 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.740
 this is an immunity 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.000
 so how to differentiate 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.580
 weaknesses of the double weaknesses and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.960
 double resistance resistors so already 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.150
 you have to know that a pokemon with a 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.610
 one and only chip does not want to have 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.810
 double weakness or double resistance 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.670
 on the other hand for pokemon 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.230
 with a double title since it exists 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.360
 pokemon can have double 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.430
 type by cons do not look for triples 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.780
 type it does not exist at least not yet 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.060
 to be no it's not with the seventh 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.380
 generation the weaknesses and the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.270
 resistors actually will combine 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.920
 between the two types 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.600
 I will take the example of the tram for 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.210
 you explain so they tran he is from 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.980
 fire and steel type if you check the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.180
 table of types can see that these two 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.550
 types are both low at 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.140
 ground attacks 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.460
 so does that mean it wants 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.890
 to say that they will tran a double 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.870
 weakness on the ground to take another 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 example the type fire effect snuggled close 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.800
 but the steel type the oil and resists 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 so in this case what's going on 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.580
 well it is rather simple weakness 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.080
 and the resistance will combine and 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.430
 will create a neutrality 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.630
 so that they track down will take 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.220
 neutral damage on site attacks 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.900
 close so I'm going to finish with a 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.510
 last example our steel him he's from 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.980
 type plant and steel the type plant it 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.480
 is weak to poison type attacks 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.220
 but the tool pass him there is 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.840
 totally immune so what is 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.220
 is going gonna interest us all 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.450
 simply immune to poison 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 so after seeing the types the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.420
 question that one can ask is it is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.310
 what all types his ego is what 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.930
 all the types are thus worth not in 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.920
 must be honest there are some 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.920
 types that are much more 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 interesting others after you need to know 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.690
 dissociate their offensive efficiency from 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.040
 their defensive efficiency for example 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.440
 dragon type does super damage 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.880
 effective to other types dragon does 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.040
 damage little effective on the type 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.250
 steel and fire no damage to the ticks made 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.500
 and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.330
 for the remaining 15 types he's going 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.040
 hit in a neutral way at the level 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.170
 defensive title to us they resist 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.120
 to the electric type fire and water plants 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.600
 it will take super effective guy 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.920
 on the type dragon ice is made and of 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 blow it will be neutral on the eleven 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.160
 other type remaining so to conclude on 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.020
 can say that the dragon type he is 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.540
 super good offensively even excellent 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.550
 done is rather defensively way 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.930
 so this is this example that this 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.600
 first episode ends so there is 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.430
 a lot of stuff that I have not touched 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.870
 some may notice it but 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.350
 it will be done on the next episode 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.640
 since will see that the 200 woods and iron 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.680
 both subjects without box rather well 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.670
 so I say nothing I leave you for the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.670
 next episode hi
