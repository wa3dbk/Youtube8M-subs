00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
element you need filter size around 82

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.050 
element you need filter size around 82
millimeters<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.470> weights<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.070> yeah

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
millimeters and it weights a lot yeah

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.139 
millimeters and it weights a lot yeah
it's<00:01:45.240> quite<00:01:45.540> heavy<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.040> 940<00:01:47.040> grams<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:48.000> if

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's quite heavy it's 940 grams but if

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's quite heavy it's 940 grams but if
you<00:01:48.240> consider<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.049> three<00:01:49.619> lenses

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you consider that you have three lenses

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.120 
you consider that you have three lenses
in<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.549> lens<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:51.740> separately<00:01:52.740> buy

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
in one lens and you would separately buy

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
in one lens and you would separately buy
all<00:01:53.460> those<00:01:53.640> three<00:01:53.939> lenses<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.509> carry<00:01:54.689> them

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
all those three lenses and carry them

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.580 
all those three lenses and carry them
with<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
with you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.660 
with you
it<00:01:56.250> would<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.670> quite<00:01:57.119> heavier<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:58.670> yeah

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it would be quite heavier I think yeah

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.469 
it would be quite heavier I think yeah
for<00:02:00.000> around<00:02:01.219> 1150<00:02:02.219> euro<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.149> quite

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
for around 1150 euro it's quite

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.490 
for around 1150 euro it's quite
expensive<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.250> maximum<00:02:05.700> aperture

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
expensive but with this maximum aperture

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.710 
expensive but with this maximum aperture
f2<00:02:07.500> point<00:02:07.829> zero<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.940> quite

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
f2 point zero it's quite

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.370 
f2 point zero it's quite
in<00:02:11.020> terms<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.800> light<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.690> smallest<00:02:13.990> aperture

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
in terms of light the smallest aperture

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.090 
in terms of light the smallest aperture
that<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.160> get<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.550> lens<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:16.000> f-16

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
that you can get on this lens is f-16

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.640 
that you can get on this lens is f-16
it's<00:02:18.100> great<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.550> shooting<00:02:18.700> nature<00:02:19.440> or<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
the performance of this lens in terms of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.030 
the performance of this lens in terms of

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
does not vignette like hell and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.130 
does not vignette like hell and
therefore<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> pretty<00:02:49.030> cool<00:02:49.360> landfill

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
for full-frame cameras here I got the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.780 
for full-frame cameras here I got the
canon<00:02:55.810> eos<00:02:56.170> 5d<00:02:56.200> mark<00:02:56.770> ii<00:02:57.130> which<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.760> a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
canon eos 5d mark ii which is a

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.699 
canon eos 5d mark ii which is a
full-frame<00:02:58.209> camera<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.750> course<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.200> focus

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
full-frame camera of course the focus

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.490 
full-frame camera of course the focus
distance<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.400> quite<00:03:03.820> small<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.780> get<00:03:05.110> from

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
distance is quite small so you get from

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.490 
distance is quite small so you get from
24<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.430> 35<00:03:06.850> millimetres<00:03:07.480> very<00:03:07.750> quick<00:03:08.080> it's

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
24 to 35 millimetres very quick it's

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.430 
24 to 35 millimetres very quick it's
great<00:03:08.770> for<00:03:08.950> shooting<00:03:09.310> videos<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:11.230> course
