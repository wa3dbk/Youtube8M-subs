for<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.230> week<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.099> thought<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.179> would<00:00:12.269> be

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
for this week so I thought that would be

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.320 
for this week so I thought that would be
a<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:12.780> fun<00:00:12.870> idea<00:00:13.080> until<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.920> looked<00:00:14.299> until<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
a really fun idea until I looked until I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870 
a really fun idea until I looked until I
looked<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.719> my<00:00:15.839> fridge<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.580> realized<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.699> we

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
looked in my fridge and realized that we

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.400 
looked in my fridge and realized that we
don't<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.270> anything<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:18.900> nothing<00:00:19.289> we

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
don't have anything we have nothing we

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.640 
don't have anything we have nothing we
haven't<00:00:19.529> gone<00:00:19.680> shopping<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:21.029> days<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
haven't gone shopping in days and it's

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.150 
haven't gone shopping in days and it's
super<00:00:23.400> empty<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> thought<00:00:25.320> maybe<00:00:25.740> all

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
super empty and then I thought maybe all

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
super empty and then I thought maybe all
i'll<00:00:26.849> include<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.779> cupboards<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> doesn't

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
look like it's so bare and then i

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.260 
look like it's so bare and then i
realized<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> cupboards<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.090> also
