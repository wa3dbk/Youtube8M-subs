00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
want this to go kind of curve around

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.210 
want this to go kind of curve around
there<00:00:14.450> kind<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:16.640> curve<00:00:17.640> curve<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.810> Kev<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
there kind of curve curve and Kev and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.439 
there kind of curve curve and Kev and
then<00:00:20.340> you're<00:00:20.460> gonna<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:21.000> something

then you're gonna want to do something
similar<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> other<00:00:22.080> side<00:00:22.380> curving

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
similar on the other side curving

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.480 
similar on the other side curving
curving<00:00:23.730> curving<00:00:24.359> curving<00:00:25.019> then<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:26.099> you're

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
curving curving curving then here you're

gonna want to have the leaves coming

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.580 
gonna want to have the leaves coming
like<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.760> okay<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:39.440> little<00:00:40.440> bit

like that but okay and then a little bit

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.799 
like that but okay and then a little bit
do<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.640> bit<00:00:41.820> sharp<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> Wiggly<00:00:42.690> out

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
do a little bit sharp and Wiggly out

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.500 
do a little bit sharp and Wiggly out
there<00:00:43.050> those<00:00:43.260> leaves

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
there those leaves

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
there those leaves
so<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.780> making<00:00:45.960> slightly<00:00:46.350> racy<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so just making slightly racy on the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.439 
so just making slightly racy on the
inside<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:49.070> little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.190> Wiggly<00:00:50.610> say<00:00:51.090> indeed

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
inside a little bit Wiggly say indeed

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.689 
inside a little bit Wiggly say indeed
that<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.050> strip<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.649> bit<00:00:53.039> sharp<00:00:53.399> on

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that kind of strip a little bit sharp on

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.610 
that kind of strip a little bit sharp on
the<00:00:53.820> inside<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.320> kind

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the inside like that and then you kind

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.180 
the inside like that and then you kind
of<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.100> around<00:01:00.770> make<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> slightly

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of want to go around make it slightly

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.980 
of want to go around make it slightly
Wiggly<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> outside<00:01:05.390> kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> follow<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
Wiggly on the outside kind of follow the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.940 
Wiggly on the outside kind of follow the
bits<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.320> usual<00:01:07.830> where<00:01:08.010> you've<00:01:08.130> been<00:01:08.250> around

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
bits that usual where you've been around

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
bits that usual where you've been around
like<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:13.369> around<00:01:15.259> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
like that and then you can around but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.870 
like that and then you can around but
that<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:18.920> there<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.729> then

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that you like that there we go and then

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.020 
that you like that there we go and then
we<00:01:21.000> could<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.330> these<00:01:21.540> other<00:01:21.869> bits<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
we could do these other bits in the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.100 
we could do these other bits in the
other<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
other way and then you want to do a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
other way and then you want to do a
little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.009> middle<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.460> each<00:01:29.610> square

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
little bit in the middle of each square

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
little bit in the middle of each square
is<00:01:30.689> square<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.320> diamond<00:01:32.070> drill

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.840 

that<00:01:35.670> should<00:01:36.360> give<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.990> pineapple<00:01:40.820> put<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that should give you a pineapple put a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
that should give you a pineapple put a
bit<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.120> shading<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
bit of shading there to put it on the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
bit of shading there to put it on the
table<00:01:44.010> as<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.390> could<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:45.660> some

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
table as it is you could put some

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.090 
table as it is you could put some
shading<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:48.200> there<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.620> like<00:01:49.650> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
shading in there if you like and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
shading in there if you like and
probably<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.940> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.270> shake<00:01:51.510> this<00:01:51.690> please

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
probably you want to shake this please
