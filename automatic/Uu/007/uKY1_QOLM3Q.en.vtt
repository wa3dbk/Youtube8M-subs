00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.260
 today we have the unboxing of the new 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.780
 smartphone zte blade 2 that came to 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.889
 mexico just a few weeks ago we are going to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.889
 know him briefly 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.650
 hello how about friends of power pda for 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.550
 our occasion we have a boxing 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.840
 another team or zte of the new series play 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.760
 these devices were presented 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.070
 barely two or three weeks ago here 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.340
 in the country with both Telcel and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.860
 Movistar and this team is a team 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.860
 let's say already as low-end pulling the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.309
 medium range with a screen of 4 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:59.470
 inches its operational status is already 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.360
 living 4.2.2 and brings to a battery a 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.059
 little larger than the other team that 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.550
 we saw earlier and it brings a processor 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.580
 dual-core 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.170
 but it is not as well as to be surprised 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.910
 but what really influences this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.220
 type of equipment is the price that has 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.960
 a price of one thousand 500 Mexican pesos in 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.420
 prepaid for which it is a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 very economical device that can well 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.310
 serve either as a temporary team to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.250
 that advanced users that suddenly 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.560
 they assault us or you already know in this country not 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.480
 those things happen then I say 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.580
 really the idea is that you can 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.080
 know of the device today swim be 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.730
 a boxing soon to know the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.310
 analysis what do you think if what 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.370
 we open and well here and remove what is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.080
 the straw in the team zte then 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.230
 these devices ourselves 12 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.300
 holes zte mexico a few days ago 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.920
 and we are being boxing if the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.040
 analysis test videos 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.320
 recordings to see that they are also to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.280
 this device as you can see besides 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.500
 brings television, which denotes that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.500
 let's say the origin really are very 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.260
 few medium-high-end teams that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.630
 not from factories or in Asian 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.590
 do not bring TV here you can see it has 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.140
 a good size 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.760
 the screen life a moment ago what 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.340
 I turned on to see if he had another battery 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.140
 I know if it looks like it's towards 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.410
 it does not look flush with the glass 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 but this is really the material is not 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.599
 really very low quality plastic 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.250
 the camera is always present 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.959
 obviously, it's not a big deal with 3 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.090
 megapixels but then there's the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.540
 little camera with its flash with its small 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.069
 flash then the device 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.150
 we will show them in detail 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.370
 soon 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.370
 now let's continue with a box 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.459
 here in the box we have the same ones 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.890
 hearing aids that can see them we have 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.290
 these 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.280
 as they are called in chargers the same in 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.360
 way of the good as of madrid are 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.569
 humorous so compact that's good and 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.090
 we have the cable obviously and also 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.590
 of course everything they have with 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.630
 manuals and usage guides and others 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.180
 third party things the guarantee policy 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.930
 of infinity then this is very good 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.840
 is the zte blade 2 soon we are going to 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.040
 do a full analysis a little more 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.820
 austere that the optimal costs 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.350
 used because basically the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.570
 truth is that it means a lot of effort 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.310
 for us to produce those videos but 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.220
 anyway we are going to talk long 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.700
 and laying of this equipment in a video a 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.129
 little shorter than usual 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.720
 remember this is mobile passion and not 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.790
 forget to subscribe and give laica 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.790
