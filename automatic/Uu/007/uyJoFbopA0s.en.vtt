yeah<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.710> figure<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.360> really<00:01:48.360> nice<00:01:48.509> detail

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
yeah this figure has really nice detail

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
yeah this figure has really nice detail
the<00:01:49.619> paint<00:01:49.890> job<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the paint job on it is kind of like a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
the paint job on it is kind of like a
wash<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> full<00:01:53.399> paint<00:01:53.729> job

can really watch this guy on the big

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.469 
can really watch this guy on the big
screen<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.729> awesome<00:02:08.879> let's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
screen it's going to be awesome let's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.140 
screen it's going to be awesome let's
take<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.690> closer<00:02:09.959> look<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.860> figure<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
take a closer look at the figure and the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.309 
take a closer look at the figure and the
articulation<00:02:12.840> or

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
articulation or

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.750 
articulation or
right<00:02:13.409> here's<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.709> closer<00:02:13.950> look<00:02:14.219> at<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> figure

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
right here's a closer look at the figure

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.940 
right here's a closer look at the figure
you<00:02:15.299> can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.659> all<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.840> paint<00:02:16.200> job<00:02:16.409> on<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you can see all the paint job on it and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.849 
you can see all the paint job on it and
it's<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.430> very<00:02:18.329> rough<00:02:18.780> paint<00:02:19.260> job<00:02:19.499> but<00:02:19.739> it

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
it's just a very rough paint job but it

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's just a very rough paint job but it
gives<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.189> a<00:02:20.400> very<00:02:20.870> unique<00:02:21.870> look<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.409> it<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:22.889> like

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
gives it a very unique look to it I like

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.619 
gives it a very unique look to it I like
it<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.549> lot<00:02:23.579> so<00:02:23.790> let's<00:02:23.939> take<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.120> closer<00:02:24.359> look<00:02:24.450> at

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
it a lot so let's take a closer look at

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.199 
it a lot so let's take a closer look at
the<00:02:24.719> articulation<00:02:25.349> his<00:02:25.829> head<00:02:25.889> doesn't<00:02:26.879> spin

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the articulation his head doesn't spin

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.759 
the articulation his head doesn't spin
all<00:02:27.359> the<00:02:27.389> way<00:02:27.480> around<00:02:27.659> because<00:02:28.139> of<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.409> suit

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
all the way around because of this suit

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.610 
all the way around because of this suit
so<00:02:29.489> it's<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:29.969> tight<00:02:30.329> there<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:30.900> that's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
so it's really tight there but that's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.149 
so it's really tight there but that's
okay<00:02:31.920> um<00:02:32.810> these<00:02:33.810> are<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.109> two<00:02:34.409> guns<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.069> the

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
okay um these are is two guns in the

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.000 
okay um these are is two guns in the
back<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:35.700> rotate<00:02:36.629> up<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
back they rotate up so you have a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.069 
back they rotate up so you have a
different<00:02:41.250> look<00:02:41.609> that's<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:42.840> nice<00:02:43.019> you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
different look that's really nice you

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.349 
different look that's really nice you
know<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.439> can<00:02:43.829> put<00:02:44.400> them<00:02:44.489> back<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:45.120> can't

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
know you can put them back you can't

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.740 
know you can put them back you can't
move<00:02:45.480> his<00:02:45.659> arms<00:02:45.930> unless<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.409> lift<00:02:46.739> up<00:02:46.950> these

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
move his arms unless you lift up these

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.189 
move his arms unless you lift up these
pads<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.349> then<00:02:49.560> his<00:02:49.799> arms<00:02:50.159> are<00:02:50.370> fully

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:51.199 
pads here and then his arms are fully

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.399 
pads here and then his arms are fully
articulated<00:02:52.199> his<00:02:53.069> form<00:02:53.519> spin<00:02:54.030> around<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.260> does

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
articulated his form spin around so does

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.890 
articulated his form spin around so does
his<00:02:55.530> hand<00:02:55.829> there's<00:02:56.489> really<00:02:57.180> no<00:02:57.599> AB

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
his hand there's really no AB

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.229 
his hand there's really no AB
articulation<00:02:58.769> or<00:02:58.919> waste<00:02:59.370> articulation<00:03:00.120> on

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
articulation or waste articulation on

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.860 
articulation or waste articulation on
this<00:03:00.389> figure<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.560> these<00:03:02.099> are<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.519> hip<00:03:03.449> joints

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
this figure and these are the hip joints

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.170 
this figure and these are the hip joints
they<00:03:03.900> spin<00:03:04.349> around<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:06.949> they<00:03:07.949> they<00:03:08.609> move<00:03:08.879> back

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
they spin around and they they move back

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.839 
they spin around and they they move back
and<00:03:09.359> forth<00:03:09.689> but<00:03:10.530> i'm<00:03:10.650> not<00:03:10.859> i'm<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.099> an<00:03:11.730> expert

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
and forth but i'm not i'm not an expert

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.610 
and forth but i'm not i'm not an expert
on<00:03:12.150> these<00:03:12.359> joints<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.139> little<00:03:13.409> different

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
on these joints it's a little different

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.629 
on these joints it's a little different
but<00:03:14.370> they<00:03:14.519> stand<00:03:14.849> up<00:03:15.060> really<00:03:15.629> well<00:03:15.900> but

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
but they stand up really well but

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.729 
but they stand up really well but
bending<00:03:17.639> them<00:03:17.819> it's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.209> little<00:03:18.629> different<00:03:18.810> two

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
bending them it's a little different two

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.229 
bending them it's a little different two
joints<00:03:20.250> at<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> knee<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:23.120> join<00:03:24.120> into

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
joints at the knee and then join into

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.520 
joints at the knee and then join into
