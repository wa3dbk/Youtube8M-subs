starbase<00:00:02.429> ugc<00:00:03.179> video<00:00:03.629> tutorial<00:00:04.470> because<00:00:05.310> we

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
starbase ugc video tutorial because we

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.619 
starbase ugc video tutorial because we
don't<00:00:05.640> have<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.790> foundry<00:00:06.210> tools<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.600> work

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
don't have the foundry tools to work

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.860 
don't have the foundry tools to work
with<00:00:06.839> yet<00:00:07.290> or<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.830> show<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:09.000> wanted<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> use<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
with yet or to show I wanted to use a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.259 
with yet or to show I wanted to use a
different<00:00:10.260> three-dimensional<00:00:11.269> software

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
different three-dimensional software

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.580 
different three-dimensional software
program<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.740> explain<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> basics<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.389> x<00:00:15.630> y&amp;z

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
program to explain the basics of x y&amp;z

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.070 
program to explain the basics of x y&amp;z
coordinates<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.580> order<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.880> map<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.779> so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
coordinates and in order to map for so

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230 
coordinates and in order to map for so
you're<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.949> know<00:00:20.070> how<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> use

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you're going to have to know how to use

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.470 
you're going to have to know how to use
these<00:00:21.930> coordinates<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.939> pretty<00:00:24.269> much<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
these coordinates this is pretty much a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.359 
these coordinates this is pretty much a
layman's<00:00:25.019> understanding<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.800> how<00:00:25.949> they<00:00:26.130> work

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
layman's understanding of how they work

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.120 
layman's understanding of how they work
so<00:00:26.730> those<00:00:27.480> who<00:00:27.720> know<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.410> 3d<00:00:28.890> mapping

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
so those who know more about 3d mapping

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
so those who know more about 3d mapping
will<00:00:29.490> probably<00:00:29.910> cringe<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.539> tutorial

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
will probably cringe from this tutorial

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
will probably cringe from this tutorial
but<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> hopefully<00:00:31.740> hopefully<00:00:32.219> it'll<00:00:32.640> help

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
but I hopefully hopefully it'll help

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
but I hopefully hopefully it'll help
some<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.719> ok<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.680> have

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
some of you out there ok so here we have

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830 
some of you out there ok so here we have
a<00:00:35.190> representation<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:36.149> three-dimensional

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
a representation of three-dimensional

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
a representation of three-dimensional
space<00:00:39.110> go<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.800> down<00:00:41.300> see<00:00:42.300> these

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
space go up you can go down see these

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.860 
space go up you can go down see these
two<00:00:42.660> lines<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> middle<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.610> point<00:00:45.090> right

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
two lines in the middle this point right

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.229 
two lines in the middle this point right
here<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.739> center<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.570> 00<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.710> x<00:00:50.309> y&amp;z

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
here the very center is 00 on all x y&amp;z

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.279 
here the very center is 00 on all x y&amp;z
coordinates<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.680> 0<00:00:53.489> x<00:00:53.850> 0<00:00:54.360> y<00:00:54.449> 0<00:00:54.690> Z

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
coordinates so if your 0 x 0 y 0 Z

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
coordinates so if your 0 x 0 y 0 Z
you're<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> let's

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
you're going to be right there so let's

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
you're going to be right there so let's
create<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.460> object<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.899> give<00:01:01.079> us<00:01:01.199> some

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
create an object to give us some

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.670 
create an object to give us some
perspective<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> create<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> cue

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
perspective so I'm going to create a cue

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.510 
perspective so I'm going to create a cue
cube<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> cube<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.100> pretty<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
cube now the cube is pretty much in the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.020 
cube now the cube is pretty much in the
center<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.260> above<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.890> ground<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.909> not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
center it's above the ground so it's not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
center it's above the ground so it's not
in<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> perfect<00:01:12.570> center<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> map<00:01:13.470> but

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
in the perfect center of the map but

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.690 
in the perfect center of the map but
it's<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> center<00:01:15.110> now<00:01:16.700> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it's pretty much in the center now to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's pretty much in the center now to
manipulate<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.409> x<00:01:19.619> y&amp;z<00:01:20.250> coordinates<00:01:22.700> well

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
manipulate the x y&amp;z coordinates well

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
manipulate the x y&amp;z coordinates well
let<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:23.939> let<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.270> explain<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.810> colors<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
let me let me explain these colors to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.960 
let me let me explain these colors to
this<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:27.920> diagram<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.460> usually<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
this little diagram is usually a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.030 
this little diagram is usually a
universal<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.350> explaining<00:01:31.950> x<00:01:32.369> y&amp;z<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.040> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
universal way of explaining x y&amp;z so the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
universal way of explaining x y&amp;z so the
X<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:37.259> red<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.520> want<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.960> move

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
X is the red and if you want to move

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
X is the red and if you want to move
something<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> red<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> move<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.700> so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
something on the red you move it so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.810 
something on the red you move it so
there<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> X<00:01:48.240> grid<00:01:51.049> now<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.590> why<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
there is the X grid now the why is the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.569 
there is the X grid now the why is the
green<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.689> want<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> move<00:01:55.500> something<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> y

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
green so want to move something on the y

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.530 
green so want to move something on the y
axis<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:57.630> change<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> Y<00:01:58.200> coordinates<00:01:59.329> he<00:02:00.329> goes

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
axis or change the Y coordinates he goes

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.359 
axis or change the Y coordinates he goes
up<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.320> goes<00:02:01.469> down<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.240> likewise<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.540> Z

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
up or it goes down and likewise the Z

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.910 
up or it goes down and likewise the Z
goes<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.129> X<00:02:10.370> Y

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
goes this way so here we go X Y

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.979 
goes this way so here we go X Y
z<00:02:16.069> now<00:02:17.069> with<00:02:17.280> each<00:02:17.520> one<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.270> these<00:02:18.510> types<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
z now with each one of these types of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.390 
z now with each one of these types of
coordinates<00:02:19.380> there's<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.709> both<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.069> positive

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
coordinates there's of both a positive

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600 
coordinates there's of both a positive
value<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.660> negative<00:02:22.140> value<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.130> let's<00:02:23.370> go

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
value and a negative value so let's go

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.130 
value and a negative value so let's go
up<00:02:23.849> here<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.630> let's<00:02:25.190> go<00:02:26.190> back<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.430> zero<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
up here and let's go back to zero on the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.030 
up here and let's go back to zero on the
X<00:02:29.390> let's<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.540> 0<00:02:30.959> on<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:33.709> place<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.890> at<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
X let's go 0 on all place it at the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.199 
X let's go 0 on all place it at the
center<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.090> map<00:02:36.300> again<00:02:37.580> okay<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:39.060> i

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
center of the map again okay so if i

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.740 
center of the map again okay so if i
want<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.600> negative<00:02:40.110> x<00:02:40.700> coordinates<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
want to go negative x coordinates it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.600 
want to go negative x coordinates it
goes<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.530> way<00:02:44.540> towards<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.720> negative<00:02:45.930> side

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
goes this way towards the negative side

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
goes this way towards the negative side
if<00:02:47.610> i<00:02:47.790> want<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> go<00:02:48.209> positive<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:49.650> goes<00:02:49.860> this

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
if i want to go positive it goes this

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.460 
if i want to go positive it goes this
way<00:02:50.370> towards<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.360> positive<00:02:51.600> side<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
way towards the positive side of the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.000 
way towards the positive side of the
side<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.010> line<00:02:53.750> likewise<00:02:54.750> why<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.530> i<00:02:55.769> go<00:02:55.980> to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
side of the line likewise why if i go to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.509 
side of the line likewise why if i go to
negative<00:02:56.340> Y<00:02:56.790> coordinates<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.660> goes<00:02:57.870> down<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.590> I

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
negative Y coordinates it goes down if I

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.729 
negative Y coordinates it goes down if I
go<00:02:59.700> positive<00:03:00.000> Y<00:03:00.480> coordinates<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.290> goes<00:03:01.500> up<00:03:02.180> and

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
go positive Y coordinates it goes up and

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.460 
go positive Y coordinates it goes up and
with<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.980> Z<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.690> negative<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.319> goes

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
with the Z if I go negative it goes

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.580 
with the Z if I go negative it goes
backwards<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.569> go<00:03:09.780> positive<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.440> goes

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
backwards if I go positive it goes

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.250 
backwards if I go positive it goes
forward<00:03:11.180> now<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> little<00:03:13.140> tricky

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
forward now this can be a little tricky

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.849 
forward now this can be a little tricky
because<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.459> changes<00:03:15.330> depending<00:03:15.569> on<00:03:16.049> how

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
because it changes depending on how

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.110 
because it changes depending on how
you're<00:03:17.100> facing<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.700> object<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.410> if<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.459> on

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
you're facing the object so if I'm on

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.620 
you're facing the object so if I'm on
this<00:03:21.720> side<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.459> X<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.570> comes<00:03:24.930> toward<00:03:25.320> me

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
this side and I go X it comes toward me

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.340 
this side and I go X it comes toward me
but<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:27.750> I'm<00:03:27.900> facing<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:31.019> do<00:03:31.079> the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
but if I'm facing this way and I do the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.270 
but if I'm facing this way and I do the
same<00:03:31.590> thing<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.670> goes<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.150> way<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.829> it's

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
same thing it goes that way so it's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.680 
same thing it goes that way so it's
always<00:03:35.489> important<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.000> remember<00:03:36.299> what

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
always important to remember what

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.780 
always important to remember what
perspective<00:03:37.200> your<00:03:37.680> camera<00:03:38.160> space<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
perspective your camera space in the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.500 
perspective your camera space in the
easiest<00:03:39.239> way<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.900> always<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.850> top-down

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
easiest way is always to do a top-down

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.729 
easiest way is always to do a top-down
view<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:44.269> do<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.600> way<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.470> want<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
view and do it that way so you want to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.259 
view and do it that way so you want to
move<00:03:46.859> your<00:03:47.010> planet<00:03:47.430> here<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.000> want<00:03:48.180> your

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
move your planet here and you want your

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.949 
move your planet here and you want your
planet<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:48.900> down<00:03:49.280> or<00:03:50.570> maybe<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.840> don't

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
planet to go down or maybe you don't

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.319 
planet to go down or maybe you don't
like<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.380> placement<00:03:52.859> of<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.280> few<00:03:53.489> asteroids<00:03:54.090> so

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
like the placement of a few asteroids so

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.259 
like the placement of a few asteroids so
you<00:03:54.420> move<00:03:54.630> them<00:03:54.900> around<00:03:55.019> move<00:03:55.650> them<00:03:55.920> forward

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.310 

bring<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.359> up

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.990 

now<00:04:04.320> it'll<00:04:04.620> take<00:04:04.890> some<00:04:05.070> time<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.670> play<00:04:05.880> around

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
now it'll take some time to play around

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.090 
now it'll take some time to play around
with<00:04:06.390> this<00:04:06.570> but<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:06.990> think<00:04:07.020> once<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.530> use<00:04:07.890> to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
with this but I think once you use to

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.830 
with this but I think once you use to
moving<00:04:08.520> objects<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.180> three-dimensional

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
moving objects in three-dimensional

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.020 
moving objects in three-dimensional
space<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:11.070> x<00:04:11.280> y&amp;z<00:04:11.940> will<00:04:12.210> become<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:14.100> pretty

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
space the x y&amp;z will become a pretty

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.660 
space the x y&amp;z will become a pretty
common<00:04:15.330> sensible<00:04:16.130> well<00:04:17.130> that's<00:04:17.310> astute

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
common sensible well that's astute

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.810 
common sensible well that's astute
