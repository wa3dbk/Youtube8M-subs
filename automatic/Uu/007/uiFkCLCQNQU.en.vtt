00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
in the red zone and I don't think the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.950 
in the red zone and I don't think the
struggles<00:01:11.610> you've<00:01:11.729> seen<00:01:11.939> offensively<00:01:12.630> I

struggles you've seen offensively I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
struggles you've seen offensively I
don't<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.250> number<00:01:14.850> three

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
don't think it's because number three

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
don't think it's because number three
has<00:01:15.180> been<00:01:15.390> terrible<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.350> been

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
has been terrible I think it's been

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
has been terrible I think it's been
because<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.220> run<00:01:17.549> game<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.330> whole<00:01:18.600> unit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because that run game the whole unit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
because that run game the whole unit
that<00:01:19.380> whole<00:01:19.590> factor<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.790> been<00:01:21.000> nearly<00:01:21.330> as

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that whole factor has not been nearly as

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
that whole factor has not been nearly as
effective<00:01:21.810> no<00:01:22.200> 100-yard<00:01:22.860> games<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.729> think

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
effective no 100-yard games here I think

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.280 
effective no 100-yard games here I think
you've<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> chance<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> hundred
