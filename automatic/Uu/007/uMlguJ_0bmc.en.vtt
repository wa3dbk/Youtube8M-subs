00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 a wonderful beginning of the week wishes 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.210
 my name is jim hanse and we 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.240
 hear us call once today 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.769
 of duty advanced warfighter 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.980
 yes in the title that's my opinion 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.690
 to the new in november appearing 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.310
 title you know once a year must 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.810
 a new call of duty to come out part 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.150
 Otherwise, the year was not easy 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
 completely and that's what I should 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.320
 have a guest gameplay used by call 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 of duty black ops 2 1 sent by poly 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 or +50 is worth its worth 37 to 2 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 on the map cargo in sniper 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 mode and that 's such a box 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.160
 In between, I play sometimes completely 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 but I like to get on cargo there 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.059
 honestly not really what the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 sun also plays no role i have 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.719
 the gameplay for a simple reason 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.719
 I do not know what you do 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.250
 now from the official trailer already 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.620
 may use to own videos to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 then do not do it later somehow 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 that's why I got that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 Just let it out completely and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.579
 I thought we take a guest 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 Gameplay that fulfills its purpose more 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.449
 as enough and you see the video itself 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.220
 is not so special now say five 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.510
 minutes 38 so have the turn now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.590
 this exit gameplay 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.180
 if there is not something left behind 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.030
 cut then remains in this 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 thing and that's enough for my claims 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 also completely out of a little something 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.900
 to the actual game what you do now 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.130
 in the trailer already looks yes to say or 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 to give my opinion to the best 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.570
 So first thing that you notice 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.640
 yes unique feature of netmoms 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 he threw then that will be that the soldiers 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.350
 wear a suit or an exoskeleton 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.759
 which they then have these skills 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.540
 Among other things, you can jump higher and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 all sorts of a shit 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.490
 probably also with drying 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 can yes hello crisis we had everything 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.750
 it can only take minutes 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.520
 act until the next confusion 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.960
 style or the thing we did 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.610
 had the next on the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.990
 Anyway, sun is coming 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.100
 I had to be so direct at first 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.270
 then think exoskeleton 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.950
 or the complete 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.479
 Combat suit giving you the ability 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.070
 or stronger or no idea what 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.960
 That's what it's like for me 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.040
 unique feature of crysis is called 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.229
 Of course not that other players that 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.299
 not allowed to record but I have stop 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.860
 as I said first of all to the game 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.180
 thought as well as this wall 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.570
 climbing skills things you know 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.450
 already the part what the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.560
 those spiderman things in there 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.480
 gloves have something up here 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.250
 can now fail in about hans 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.900
 warfare with it as the first share 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.280
 fully made clear yes on the walls 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.140
 run around or climb up 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.240
 that can be such a thing for me 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.820
 I'm sorting personally with myself now 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.770
 head directly to full and i share 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 can imagine that the advanced 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.370
 warfighter developer as the third 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.350
 developer studios that's the thing 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.670
 will rausbringen now at 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.990
 release of acts so a bit full 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.790
 have bitten in ass because then 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.680
 but probably one at once 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.120
 a little bit in this direction is whether 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 the intention now is not that 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.060
 intention is it plays for me 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.440
 actually a minor role 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.270
 I 'm curious how it is in the game 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.489
 is implemented and or whether the in 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.650
 have the multiplayer at all with it 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.780
 So there you can do it a bit 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.280
 be curious otherwise what you see in the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 trailer else fly the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.610
 motorcycles draw and all munich 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.590
 Quadrocopter and all possible convincing 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.239
 So every amount explodes what you put in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.700
 of course, his trailer must have 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.680
 that is light lures people you understand 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.420
 something warfare stands out because is on 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.220
 no fall off the other trainers 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.630
 we are the ones we already have to the predecessors 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.620
 I've just seen it 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.850
 it's the third one 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.530
 Developer Studio that thing now 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.780
 rausbringt is me personally but 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.820
 no matter because if a studio enough 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.170
 people have enough manpower at the start 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.120
 then they could all three 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.680
 months to bring out a new game do you 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.060
 yes anyway 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.709
 In any case, the development studio plays 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.150
 for me here developer studio no 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.470
 great role as well as the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
 information is still at 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.130
 facebook have read that we have a new one 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.170
 graphic engine should be used and 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.970
 blah blah blah and somehow reminds me 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.989
 that also s.Ghost in advance was said 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.450
 but even graphic moderate is something 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.070
 new and concluding , however 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.600
 we row back then on 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.880
 end dear nothing because we had one 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.140
 few problems or no idea what is allowed 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.579
 be curious if that's pure 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.980
 is brought or not 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.230
 just like in the singleplayer the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.879
 villain, so to speak 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.050
 played with by kevin spacey and me 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.420
 I think that's almost possible 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.159
 be sure that it will be so real 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.680
 Life commercials will be where he then 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.599
 kevin turns up as a real person 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.790
 spacey ball currently the series house of 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.379
 cards one of my favorite series 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.989
 right now and that's what makes me so one 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.359
 one thing is reminiscent as if that were the case 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.949
 builds on house of cards plus ten 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.769
 years or plus five years anyway 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.790
 So that's what it's about 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.320
 I wait to be interested 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.550
 but exactly the commander warriors 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.800
 I 've just got his video 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.889
 looked at to call of duty modern 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.449
 warfare does not interest at all 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.100
 not so singleplayer I do not have 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.479
 I have installed more with the old ones 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.710
 partly do not share at all 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.910
 started and I always get it then 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.229
 to hear it again when I hear it live 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.150
 streams or something like that but that 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.320
 story is so great and you have to 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.090
 In any case, look at you 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.100
 So first I have to go 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.900
 nothing and secondly I'm interested 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.780
 I just do not want just that 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.580
 play multiplayer and now every one 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.169
 year new call of duty part comes out 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.639
 or not we have that in hand 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.780
 if we will not buy those things 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.010
 that no longer develops 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.000
 or hopefully then 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.530
 a little more love in the 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 I put older parts of it 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.430
 honestly, would not go out 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.470
 My personal opinion is it needs 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.780
 not every year a new call of 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.880
 Duty part and or a new part 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.530
 battlefield or something like that yes me 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.729
 I'm a big friend of that one 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.010
 sometimes 23 years 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.440
 plays a specific title and then 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.389
 maybe again a dlc 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.700
 of it on the market is yes find that 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.169
 I personally good and that would 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.840
 I am also happy about it when it comes 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.610
 call of duty would take hold 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.080
 that one first analysis resp 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.849
 a first assessment of call of duty 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.919
 I almost have modern warfare now 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.870
 but of course it does something 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.050
 advanced warfighter finally thing 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.250
 mettmann's advanced warfare and me 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.289
 Stay tuned I'll watch it 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.880
 But sometimes it really turns out 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.260
 of course, this trailer now 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.880
 do not look my name is japanese me 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.750
 say thank you for watching we meet 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.750
 in my next video
