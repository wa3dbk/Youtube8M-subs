have been familiar with in the past

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.219 
have been familiar with in the past
we've<00:01:05.339> done<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.900> found

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
we've done this because we have found

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.380 
we've done this because we have found
that<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.159> our<00:01:08.400> select<00:01:08.909> cables

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that like with our select cables

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
that like with our select cables
eliminating<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> metallic<00:01:13.170> color<00:01:13.619> doping

eliminating that metallic color doping

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
eliminating that metallic color doping
that<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.400> used<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> make<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> colors<00:01:15.450> in

the<00:01:19.310> sonic<00:01:20.310> signature<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:22.439> cable<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> more

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the sonic signature the cable is more

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
the sonic signature the cable is more
musical<00:01:23.369> again<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.659> dynamic<00:01:25.290> 12<00:01:26.040> TC<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.229> one
