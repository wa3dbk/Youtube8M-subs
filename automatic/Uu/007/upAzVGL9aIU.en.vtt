on it but I mean I don't know I consider

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.859 
on it but I mean I don't know I consider
it<00:02:03.390> sniping<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.090> from<00:02:06.750> what

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it sniping because you know from what

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
it sniping because you know from what
I've<00:02:06.990> known<00:02:07.380> sniping<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.280> means<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.640> know

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I've known sniping just means you know

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.999 
I've known sniping just means you know
from<00:02:08.910> way<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.390> anything<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.800> doesn't

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
from way out in anything that doesn't

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.350 
from way out in anything that doesn't
even<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.730> guns<00:02:11.940> sometimes<00:02:12.450> but

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
even have to do with guns sometimes but

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.270 
even have to do with guns sometimes but
that's<00:02:13.660> besides<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.110> point<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.740> good<00:02:15.130> isn't

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
that's besides the point is good isn't

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.490 
that's besides the point is good isn't
that<00:02:15.550> bad<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.820> think<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.380> know

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
that bad I think that it it you know

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.970 
that bad I think that it it you know
goes<00:02:17.710> as<00:02:18.010> far<00:02:18.370> as<00:02:18.430> LMGs<00:02:18.820> go<00:02:19.030> because<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:20.050> far<00:02:20.380> as

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
goes as far as LMGs go because in far as

goes as far as LMGs go because in far as

to<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:37.780> very<00:02:37.870> accurate<00:02:38.260> at<00:02:38.590> all<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.040> guns

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to be very accurate at all you know guns

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.160

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
meter will do do some pretty heavy

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.100 
meter will do do some pretty heavy
damage<00:02:44.890> more<00:02:45.640> than<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.300> more<00:02:46.660> than<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> usual

damage more than you more than the usual
you<00:02:47.560> know<00:02:47.680> half<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.850> three<00:02:49.300> fourths<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
you know half to three fourths of the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.860 
you know half to three fourths of the
full<00:02:50.080> bar<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:51.070> know<00:02:51.190> some<00:02:51.610> quarter<00:02:52.390> bars<00:02:52.600> will

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
full bar you know some quarter bars will

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.479 
full bar you know some quarter bars will
be<00:02:52.989> better<00:02:53.140> than<00:02:53.320> three<00:02:53.560> fourth<00:02:53.920> bars<00:02:54.160> but

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
be better than three fourth bars but

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.240 
be better than three fourth bars but
it's<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.780> don't<00:02:56.350> really<00:02:56.470> go<00:02:56.709> by<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.010> think

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
it's I don't really go by that I think

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.660 
it's I don't really go by that I think
that<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.459> very<00:02:57.489> inaccurate<00:02:58.300> but<00:02:59.260> in<00:03:00.010> order<00:03:00.220> of

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
that is very inaccurate but in order of

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.810 
that is very inaccurate but in order of
power<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.959> my<00:03:02.290> opinion<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:02.980> my<00:03:03.040> experience

of<00:03:03.880> using<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.239> guns<00:03:04.450> i'm<00:03:04.570> going<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.780> have

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
of using the guns i'm going to have

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.620 
of using the guns i'm going to have
prestige<00:03:05.230> 24<00:03:05.800> times<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:07.209> know<00:03:07.300> I've<00:03:07.600> used

I've<00:03:08.170> been<00:03:08.590> around<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.860> block<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.430> far<00:03:09.670> as

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
guns I think that it would go m60 then

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.650 
guns I think that it would go m60 then
the<00:03:14.260> stoner<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> HK<00:03:15.459> 21<00:03:15.820> tide<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.540> then

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
the stoner and the HK 21 tide and then

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.680 
the stoner and the HK 21 tide and then
obviously<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.230> RPK<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.120> really<00:03:19.120> nobody<00:03:19.510> ever

I<00:04:18.669> mean<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.329> could<00:04:19.450> compare<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
I mean you could compare that and the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.969 
I mean you could compare that and the
RPK<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.340> year<00:04:21.520> maybe<00:04:22.260> Kippur<00:04:23.260> asst<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.830> I

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
RPK and the year maybe Kippur asst and I

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.260 
RPK and the year maybe Kippur asst and I
don't<00:04:24.250> see<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> lot<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.640> people<00:04:24.880> using<00:04:25.060> that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
don't see a lot of people using that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.290 
don't see a lot of people using that
however<00:04:25.450> you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
however you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.089 
however you
unlock<00:04:26.569> it<00:04:26.599> at<00:04:26.780> level<00:04:26.990> 1<00:04:27.169> like<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.620> RPK<00:04:27.889> you

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
unlock it at level 1 like the RPK you

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.330 
unlock it at level 1 like the RPK you
unlock<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.550> at<00:04:28.639> level<00:04:28.909> 41<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.319> I<00:04:30.800> don't<00:04:31.220> think

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
unlock it at level 41 so I don't think

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.189 
unlock it at level 41 so I don't think
you<00:04:31.400> can<00:04:31.490> compare<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.879> two<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.330> definitely

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
you can compare the two I definitely

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.070 
you can compare the two I definitely
think<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.120> basic<00:04:35.120> 821<00:04:35.569> like<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.750> said<00:04:36.050> I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
think that the basic 821 like I said I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.770 
think that the basic 821 like I said I
can<00:04:36.409> die<00:04:36.560> i'll<00:04:37.009> say<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.370> again<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.759> is<00:04:37.849> not<00:04:38.330> that

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
can die i'll say it again it is not that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.080 
can die i'll say it again it is not that
