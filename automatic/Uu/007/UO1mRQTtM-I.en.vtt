sharp<00:00:27.490> minor<00:00:28.170> animism<00:00:29.170> so<00:00:30.010> the<00:00:30.490> rhythm

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
sharp minor animism so the rhythm

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.670 
sharp minor animism so the rhythm
pattern<00:00:31.180> is<00:00:31.300> of<00:00:31.450> 8<00:00:31.689> bits<00:00:31.960> flashing<00:00:32.529> on<00:00:32.650> the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
following the rhythm pattern - so the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.740 
following the rhythm pattern - so the
rhythm<00:00:38.170> pattern<00:00:38.440> is<00:00:38.739> mute<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.300> can<00:00:40.510> film

you and you can form mutant 4 so this

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.939 
you and you can form mutant 4 so this
system<00:00:45.580> pattern<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.480> bit<00:00:46.989> tricky<00:00:47.410> as<00:00:47.559> far<00:00:47.800> as
