right so you can write and draw on the
screen<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.960> being<00:00:34.260> demonstrated<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
screen is as being demonstrated here and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.470 
screen is as being demonstrated here and
suppose<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.390> different<00:00:36.899> fresh<00:00:37.050> arrival<00:00:37.500> not

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
suppose up different fresh arrival not

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
suppose up different fresh arrival not
the<00:00:39.480> Sun<00:00:39.660> Sun<00:00:39.899> set<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.200> yet<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.829> suppose<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the Sun Sun set up yet I suppose a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.389 
the Sun Sun set up yet I suppose a
different<00:00:42.149> impression<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.070> you

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
different impression about it so so you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
different impression about it so so you
know<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> artists<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.120> able<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.539> try<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
know the artists will be able to try and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
know the artists will be able to try and
say<00:00:46.739> differently<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> different<00:00:48.239> level

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
say differently with a different level

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.250 
say differently with a different level
different<00:00:49.440> level<00:00:49.890> strokes<00:00:50.300> it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.480> 10.1<00:00:52.020> inch

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
different level strokes it's a 10.1 inch

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.840

around 10 hours of battery life which is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
around 10 hours of battery life which is
why<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.010> doesn't<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.550> powerful

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
why it doesn't have a more powerful

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.380 
why it doesn't have a more powerful
processor<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.939> battery

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
processor but you know the the battery

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
processor but you know the the battery
life<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> gets<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:07.200> battery<00:01:07.500> life<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.740> say<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
life it gets more battery life and say a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.210 
life it gets more battery life and say a
samsung<00:01:08.340> series<00:01:08.640> 7<00:01:08.670> right<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.860> seemed

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
samsung series 7 right now and it seemed

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
samsung series 7 right now and it seemed
to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.340> fairly<00:01:11.700> responsive<00:01:12.060> especially<00:01:13.049> with

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to be fairly responsive especially with

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.539 
to be fairly responsive especially with
windows<00:01:13.409> 8<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.010> optimized<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
windows 8 which is really optimized for

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.140 
windows 8 which is really optimized for
touch<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.210> i'm<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.320> show<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
touch and i'm going to show you that it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.240 
touch and i'm going to show you that it
does

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.700 

right<00:01:22.790> all<00:01:23.180> right

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
right all right

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.680 
right all right
so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> guess<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.820> set<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.420> fresh

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
so I guess we set it up now for fresh

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.630 
so I guess we set it up now for fresh
searching<00:01:27.990> today<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> driver

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
searching today but it was the driver

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
searching today but it was the driver
was<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> Install<00:01:31.049> Now<00:01:31.200> game<00:01:32.010> is<00:01:32.159> pretty

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
was in the Install Now game is pretty

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
was in the Install Now game is pretty
resource-intensive<00:01:33.770> yeah<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.830> takes<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> while

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
resource-intensive yeah it takes a while

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.200 
resource-intensive yeah it takes a while
by<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> way<00:01:35.550> down<00:01:35.700> what<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.880> came<00:01:35.940> here<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
by the way down what I came here to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.170 
by the way down what I came here to
right<00:01:36.690> brother<00:01:37.020> let's<00:01:37.320> deal<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.880> way

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
right brother let's deal it's this way

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.050 
right brother let's deal it's this way
it's<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.340> actually<00:01:41.340> supports<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's good and actually supports the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.390 
it's good and actually supports the
pressure<00:01:42.390> pressure<00:01:43.020> pressure<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:44.220> cope<00:01:44.369> very

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
pressure pressure pressure can cope very

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.200 
pressure pressure pressure can cope very
well<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.899> great<00:01:46.100> really<00:01:47.100> yeah<00:01:47.210> we've

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
well and it's great really yeah we've

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
on their own it runs windows 8 see well

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.680 
on their own it runs windows 8 see well
so<00:02:52.190> thank<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.400> very<00:02:52.430> much<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.450> Koopa
