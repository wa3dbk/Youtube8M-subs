solar system the solar system is a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.049 
solar system the solar system is a
planetary<00:00:09.590> system<00:00:10.130> of<00:00:10.219> objects<00:00:10.700> that<00:00:10.880> exist

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
planetary system of objects that exist

planetary system of objects that exist
in<00:00:11.450> an<00:00:11.570> ecliptic<00:00:12.110> plane<00:00:12.410> these<00:00:13.370> objects<00:00:14.059> orbit

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
in an ecliptic plane these objects orbit

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.909 
in an ecliptic plane these objects orbit
around<00:00:15.550> and<00:00:16.660> are<00:00:17.660> bound<00:00:17.990> by<00:00:18.260> gravity<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:20.919> a

star<00:00:23.739> called<00:00:24.739> the<00:00:25.099> Sun<00:00:25.960> so<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.110> solar<00:00:27.410> system

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
star called the Sun so the solar system

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.810 
star called the Sun so the solar system
is<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:29.140> system<00:00:30.140> of<00:00:30.349> objects<00:00:31.070> that<00:00:31.189> orbits

the other objects orbit around it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.590 
the other objects orbit around it
because<00:00:40.280> they<00:00:40.430> are<00:00:40.490> pulled<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:41.060> by<00:00:41.240> the<00:00:41.300> Sun's

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
because they are pulled in by the Sun's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.470 
because they are pulled in by the Sun's
gravity<00:00:42.610> now<00:00:43.610> objects<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.150> orbit<00:00:44.240> around

orbit<00:00:59.900> around<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.230> Sun<00:01:00.440> they<00:01:00.980> do<00:01:01.040> not<00:01:01.340> all

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
orbit around the Sun they do not all

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.600 
orbit around the Sun they do not all
orbit<00:01:01.940> at<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.180> same<00:01:02.420> rate<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.009> they<00:01:04.400> have

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
orbit at the same rate and so they have

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.490 
orbit at the same rate and so they have
different<00:01:04.790> paths<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.630> they<00:01:05.780> trace<00:01:06.049> around

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
different paths that they trace around

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.340 
different paths that they trace around
the<00:01:06.619> Sun<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:08.240> definition<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.840> planets<00:01:09.229> has

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
the Sun the definition of planets has

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.859 
the Sun the definition of planets has
changed<00:01:09.799> at<00:01:10.340> one<00:01:10.640> time<00:01:10.939> there<00:01:11.390> were<00:01:11.569> nine

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
changed at one time there were nine

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.010 
changed at one time there were nine
planets<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.310> nine<00:01:13.549> objects<00:01:14.179> classified<00:01:14.869> as

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
planets so nine objects classified as

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.559 
planets so nine objects classified as
planets<00:01:15.499> in<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.159> solar<00:01:16.310> system<00:01:16.460> now<00:01:17.270> there

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
planets in the solar system now there

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.440 
planets in the solar system now there
are<00:01:17.689> only<00:01:17.960> eight<00:01:18.319> so<00:01:19.100> nothing<00:01:19.429> happened<00:01:19.969> to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
are only eight so nothing happened to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.450 
are only eight so nothing happened to
the<00:01:20.569> ninth<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.079> it<00:01:21.289> just<00:01:21.649> is<00:01:21.950> no<00:01:22.100> longer

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
the ninth one it just is no longer

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.819 
the ninth one it just is no longer
classified<00:01:22.670> as<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.600> planet<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.289> is<00:01:24.350> classified

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
classified as a planet it is classified

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.039 
classified as a planet it is classified
as<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.429> dwarf<00:01:26.389> planet<00:01:26.630> instead<00:01:27.999> so<00:01:28.999> of<00:01:29.359> our

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
as a dwarf planet instead so of our

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.899 
as a dwarf planet instead so of our
planets<00:01:30.740> there<00:01:31.340> are<00:01:31.369> four<00:01:32.619> inner<00:01:34.840> terrestrial

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
planets there are four inner terrestrial

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.999 
planets there are four inner terrestrial
planets<00:01:37.909> that<00:01:38.209> means<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:38.810> they<00:01:38.990> are<00:01:39.139> closer

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
planets that means that they are closer

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.160 
planets that means that they are closer
to<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.399> Sun<00:01:40.729> they<00:01:40.999> are<00:01:41.179> inner<00:01:41.479> they're<00:01:41.810> closer

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
to the Sun they are inner they're closer

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.260 
to the Sun they are inner they're closer
to<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.939> Sun<00:01:44.209> they<00:01:44.420> orbit<00:01:44.869> closer<00:01:45.229> than

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
to the the Sun they orbit closer than

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.419 
to the the Sun they orbit closer than
the<00:01:47.270> other<00:01:47.299> planets<00:01:47.959> so<00:01:48.560> these<00:01:48.709> four<00:01:49.069> are<00:01:49.279> the

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
the other planets so these four are the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.459 
the other planets so these four are the
inner<00:01:49.609> planets<00:01:50.240> orbiting<00:01:50.810> closest<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
inner planets orbiting closest to the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.649 
inner planets orbiting closest to the
Sun<00:01:51.709> their<00:01:52.369> terrestrial<00:01:52.639> which<00:01:53.299> means<00:01:53.509> they

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
Sun their terrestrial which means they

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.139 
Sun their terrestrial which means they
have<00:01:53.840> more<00:01:54.109> land<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.829> them<00:01:55.069> more<00:01:55.369> mass<00:01:55.609> and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
have more land to them more mass and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.519 
have more land to them more mass and
they<00:01:57.049> are<00:01:57.200> Mercury<00:01:57.740> Venus<00:01:58.130> Earth<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.850> Mars

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529 
they are Mercury Venus Earth and Mars

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:05.580 
they are Mercury Venus Earth and Mars
they're<00:02:00.529> relatively<00:02:01.130> small<00:02:03.459> dense<00:02:04.459> rocky

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
they're relatively small dense rocky

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.130 
they're relatively small dense rocky
lacquering<00:02:06.649> like<00:02:07.189> rings<00:02:07.609> and<00:02:08.060> have<00:02:08.240> few<00:02:08.630> or<00:02:08.899> no

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
lacquering like rings and have few or no

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.970 
lacquering like rings and have few or no
moons<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.220> earth<00:02:10.700> has<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> moon<00:02:11.510> but<00:02:11.930> not<00:02:11.959> all<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
moons so earth has a moon but not all of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.710 
moons so earth has a moon but not all of
the<00:02:13.130> inner<00:02:13.310> planets<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:14.000> moons<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.600> we

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
the inner planets have moons and we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.900 
the inner planets have moons and we
don't<00:02:14.870> have<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.230> many<00:02:15.440> of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
don't have that many of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.540 
don't have that many of
now<00:02:16.780> these<00:02:17.230> planets<00:02:17.590> are<00:02:17.680> relatively<00:02:18.130> small

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
now these planets are relatively small

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.850 
now these planets are relatively small
but<00:02:18.790> they're<00:02:18.970> dense<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.720> rocky<00:02:20.050> they<00:02:20.380> are<00:02:20.530> lay

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
but they're dense and rocky they are lay

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
but they're dense and rocky they are lay
into<00:02:21.040> planets

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
into planets

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.380 
into planets
next<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.400> four<00:02:24.700> outer<00:02:26.340> or<00:02:27.390> jovian

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
next we have the four outer or jovian

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.280 
next we have the four outer or jovian
planets<00:02:29.550> including<00:02:30.550> Jupiter<00:02:31.450> Saturn<00:02:31.840> Uranus

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
planets including Jupiter Saturn Uranus

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.510 
planets including Jupiter Saturn Uranus
and<00:02:32.830> Neptune

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
and Neptune

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.540 
and Neptune
so<00:02:33.880> Jovian<00:02:34.630> means<00:02:34.870> coming<00:02:35.170> from<00:02:35.500> Jupiter<00:02:35.980> so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
so Jovian means coming from Jupiter so

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.120 
so Jovian means coming from Jupiter so
they're<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.300> ones<00:02:37.510> Jupiter<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.260> outward<00:02:38.590> so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
they're the ones Jupiter and outward so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.820 
they're the ones Jupiter and outward so
they<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:39.550> they<00:02:40.300> go<00:02:40.510> further<00:02:40.840> their<00:02:41.230> orbits<00:02:41.650> are

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
they go they go further their orbits are

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.860 
they go they go further their orbits are
further<00:02:42.100> out<00:02:42.340> from<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.910> Sun<00:02:43.210> than<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.690> inner

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
further out from the Sun than the inner

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.230 
further out from the Sun than the inner
planets<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:45.420> these<00:02:46.420> are<00:02:47.280> large<00:02:48.280> these

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
planets and these are large these

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.900 
planets and these are large these
planets<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.840> larger<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.710> they<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.610> low

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
planets are larger and they have low

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.810 
planets are larger and they have low
densities<00:02:52.570> they<00:02:53.410> are<00:02:53.530> not<00:02:53.740> as<00:02:53.920> dense<00:02:54.310> as<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
densities they are not as dense as the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.360 
densities they are not as dense as the
inner<00:02:54.970> planets<00:02:55.510> they<00:02:56.170> do<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:56.650> rings<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
inner planets they do have rings and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.850 
inner planets they do have rings and
they<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:57.730> many<00:02:58.030> moons<00:02:58.360> they<00:02:59.170> are<00:02:59.320> also<00:02:59.500> known

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
they have many moons they are also known

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.310 
they have many moons they are also known
as<00:03:00.100> gas<00:03:00.460> giants<00:03:02.280> these<00:03:03.280> planets<00:03:03.910> are<00:03:04.090> made<00:03:04.900> of

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
as gas giants these planets are made of

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.730 
as gas giants these planets are made of
made<00:03:06.040> up<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.640> gas<00:03:06.970> which<00:03:07.530> makes<00:03:08.530> sense

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
made up of more gas which makes sense

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.650 
made up of more gas which makes sense
since<00:03:08.980> they<00:03:09.190> have<00:03:09.340> lower<00:03:09.610> densities<00:03:10.240> even

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
since they have lower densities even

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.750 
since they have lower densities even
though<00:03:10.810> they<00:03:10.990> are<00:03:11.110> very<00:03:11.350> large<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.400> these<00:03:12.550> are

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
though they are very large so these are

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.210 
though they are very large so these are
made<00:03:12.960> primarily<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:14.350> gas<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.860> are<00:03:14.950> known<00:03:15.070> as

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
made primarily of gas and are known as

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.210 
made primarily of gas and are known as
gas<00:03:15.460> giants<00:03:16.090> where<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:17.260> four<00:03:17.470> inner<00:03:17.710> planets

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
gas giants where the four inner planets

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.100 
gas giants where the four inner planets
are<00:03:18.400> made<00:03:18.550> more<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.850> land<00:03:19.360> are<00:03:19.660> made<00:03:19.810> more<00:03:19.990> of

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
are made more of land are made more of

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.290 
are made more of land are made more of
solid<00:03:21.480> solid<00:03:22.480> things<00:03:22.750> instead<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.410> guest<00:03:23.860> and

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
solid solid things instead of guest and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.850 
solid solid things instead of guest and
between<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.630> inner<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:25.990> outer<00:03:26.110> planets<00:03:26.740> so

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
between the inner and outer planets so

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.650 
between the inner and outer planets so
you've<00:03:27.010> got<00:03:27.190> your<00:03:27.370> four<00:03:27.610> inner<00:03:27.910> planets<00:03:28.030> and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you've got your four inner planets and

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.450 
you've got your four inner planets and
then<00:03:28.780> your<00:03:28.960> four<00:03:29.200> outer<00:03:29.410> planets<00:03:29.560> between

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
then your four outer planets between

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.900 
then your four outer planets between
those<00:03:31.090> two<00:03:31.450> is<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.530> asteroid<00:03:33.070> belt<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.760> this

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
those two is the asteroid belt so this

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.070 
those two is the asteroid belt so this
is<00:03:34.090> also<00:03:34.270> in<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.720> sun's<00:03:34.990> orbit<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.870> you've

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
is also in the sun's orbit and so you've

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.850 
is also in the sun's orbit and so you've
got<00:03:38.110> your<00:03:38.560> four<00:03:40.110> orbiting<00:03:41.110> planets<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.770> then

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
got your four orbiting planets and then

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.410 
got your four orbiting planets and then
you've<00:03:42.010> got<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.400> belt<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.970> asteroids

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
you've got this belt of asteroids

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.650 
you've got this belt of asteroids
orbiting<00:03:44.200> around<00:03:44.830> in<00:03:45.580> between<00:03:46.060> those<00:03:46.450> inner

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
orbiting around in between those inner

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.170 
orbiting around in between those inner
planets<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.380> then<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.370> outer<00:03:48.550> planets

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
planets and then the outer planets

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.800 
planets and then the outer planets
orbits<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.930> start<00:03:50.350> after<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.070> between

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
orbits that start after that so between

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.300 
orbits that start after that so between
Mars<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.459> Jupiter<00:03:55.080> orbits<00:03:56.080> think<00:03:56.770> about<00:03:56.980> Mars

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
Mars and Jupiter orbits think about Mars

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.910 
Mars and Jupiter orbits think about Mars
is<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.730> furthest<00:03:58.300> inner<00:03:58.959> planet<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.590> Jupiter

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
is the furthest inner planet and Jupiter

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.010 
is the furthest inner planet and Jupiter
is<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.100> closest<00:04:00.610> outer<00:04:00.850> planet<00:04:01.330> between<00:04:01.780> Mars

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
is the closest outer planet between Mars

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.120 
is the closest outer planet between Mars
and<00:04:02.350> Jupiter<00:04:02.530> you've<00:04:03.010> got<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:05.130> asteroid

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
and Jupiter you've got this asteroid

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.230 
and Jupiter you've got this asteroid
belt<00:04:06.400> orbiting<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:08.010> beyond<00:04:09.010> Neptune<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
belt orbiting and beyond Neptune is the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.150 
belt orbiting and beyond Neptune is the
Kuiper<00:04:10.720> belt<00:04:10.750> which<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.320> another<00:04:11.590> belt<00:04:11.920> of

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
Kuiper belt which is another belt of

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.250 
Kuiper belt which is another belt of
asteroids<00:04:12.520> and<00:04:12.880> within<00:04:13.480> these<00:04:13.750> belts<00:04:14.110> are

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
asteroids and within these belts are

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.970 
asteroids and within these belts are
five<00:04:14.470> dwarf<00:04:14.950> planets<00:04:16.020> so<00:04:17.020> they<00:04:17.560> are<00:04:17.680> bigger

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
five dwarf planets so they are bigger

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.150 
five dwarf planets so they are bigger
than<00:04:18.250> your<00:04:18.400> normal<00:04:18.549> asteroids<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:20.560> they<00:04:20.890> are

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
than your normal asteroids but they are

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.850 
than your normal asteroids but they are
not<00:04:21.489> classified<00:04:22.030> as<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.360> planet<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.230> these

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
not classified as a planet and these

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.920 
not classified as a planet and these
include<00:04:24.370> cirrus<00:04:25.270> Pluto<00:04:25.930> timaya<00:04:27.240> Makemake

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
include cirrus Pluto timaya Makemake

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.379 
include cirrus Pluto timaya Makemake
and<00:04:29.020> ears<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:30.100> these<00:04:30.250> are<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.580> five<00:04:33.389> objects

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
and ears so these are the five objects

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.670 
and ears so these are the five objects
that<00:04:34.570> have<00:04:34.660> been<00:04:34.810> classified<00:04:34.990> as<00:04:35.380> dwarf

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
that have been classified as dwarf

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.980 
that have been classified as dwarf
planets<00:04:36.280> then<00:04:36.820> you've<00:04:37.060> got<00:04:37.270> your<00:04:37.600> outer

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
planets then you've got your outer

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.200 
planets then you've got your outer
planet<00:04:38.620> your<00:04:38.919> inner<00:04:39.070> planets<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.820> they're

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
planet your inner planets and they're

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.510 
planet your inner planets and they're
all<00:04:40.360> orbiting<00:04:40.810> around<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.530> Sun<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:42.160> make<00:04:42.310> up

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
all orbiting around the Sun to make up

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:51.690 
all orbiting around the Sun to make up
the<00:04:42.729> solar<00:04:42.970> system

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.760
