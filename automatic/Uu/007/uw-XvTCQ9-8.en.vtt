00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
just have a regular power cable it seems

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
just have a regular power cable it seems
sort<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.259> thing<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> found<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> ps2<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.090> it

sort of thing you found on the ps2 so it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.109 
sort of thing you found on the ps2 so it
just<00:01:21.509> goes<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> that's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
just goes in the back here so that's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
just goes in the back here so that's
nice<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> know<00:01:24.600> you've<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> know

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
nice to know you've got you know

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.760 
nice to know you've got you know
Ethernet<00:01:26.460> HDMI<00:01:26.720> optical<00:01:27.720> audio<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.350> your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
Ethernet HDMI optical audio out and your

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.719 
Ethernet HDMI optical audio out and your
regular<00:01:29.070> multi<00:01:29.400> AV<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:31.579> otherwise<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
regular multi AV and then otherwise I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.929 
regular multi AV and then otherwise I
mean<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:34.619> pretty<00:01:34.829> basic<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.490> thing<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.880> i

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
mean it's pretty basic one thing that i

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
mean it's pretty basic one thing that i
do<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.540> though<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
do not see though is a way to take the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
do not see though is a way to take the
hard<00:01:38.250> drive<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> upgrade<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
hard drive out to upgrade it like you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140 
hard drive out to upgrade it like you
would<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.280> current<00:01:41.280> ps3<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
would on the current ps3 which is a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.639 
would on the current ps3 which is a
little<00:01:42.390> disappointing<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.439> here

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
little disappointing but and then here

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
little disappointing but and then here
we<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> existing<00:01:47.490> ps3<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
we have the existing ps3 so we can do a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.170 
we have the existing ps3 so we can do a
little<00:01:48.479> side<00:01:48.750> by<00:01:48.960> side<00:01:49.200> comparison<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.180> they

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
little side by side comparison here they

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.530 
little side by side comparison here they
look<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.619> pretty<00:01:52.619> much<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.540> length

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
look to be pretty much the same length

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.980 
look to be pretty much the same length
this<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.310> shorter<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.990> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
this way so it's just shorter and a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.240 
this way so it's just shorter and a
little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.259> thinner<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> look<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.189> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little bit thinner if you look at it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.469 
little bit thinner if you look at it
from<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> top<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:01:59.939> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
from the top you can kind of see that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.590 
from the top you can kind of see that
it's<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.469> quite<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.829> fat<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.600> basically

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it's it's not quite as fat but basically

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.979 
it's it's not quite as fat but basically
it's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> height<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.799> guess<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:05.909> drop<00:02:07.849> and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
it's a height and I guess with drop and

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.660 
it's a height and I guess with drop and
weight<00:02:09.989> wise<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.470> definitely<00:02:10.709> lighter<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
weight wise it is definitely lighter it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
weight wise it is definitely lighter it
still<00:02:11.940> feels<00:02:11.970> solid<00:02:12.690> doesn't<00:02:12.930> feel<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.170> it's

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
still feels solid doesn't feel like it's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.600 
still feels solid doesn't feel like it's
you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.680> stuff<00:02:13.860> moving<00:02:14.160> around<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.490> there

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you know stuff moving around in there

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.120 
you know stuff moving around in there
