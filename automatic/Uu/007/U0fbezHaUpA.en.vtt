drill<00:00:20.360> it<00:00:20.449> up<00:00:20.570> for<00:00:20.810> leak<00:00:20.960> tonight<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.470> we're

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
drill it up for leak tonight and we're

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.079 
drill it up for leak tonight and we're
gonna<00:00:21.710> go<00:00:21.920> in<00:00:22.039> and<00:00:22.160> take<00:00:22.339> a<00:00:22.369> look<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:22.759> see<00:00:22.910> how

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.049 

we've<00:00:39.710> made<00:00:39.860> it<00:00:39.980> inside<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.460> bowl<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.670> lot<00:00:40.879> of

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
we've made it inside the bowl a lot of

tonight<00:01:18.600> Brian<00:01:18.899> what<00:01:19.109> do<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
tonight Brian what do you see out of the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.200 
tonight Brian what do you see out of the
ball<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.609> gate<00:01:20.789> early<00:01:21.060> tonight

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
ball right out of the gate early tonight

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.419 
ball right out of the gate early tonight
I'm<00:01:21.899> used<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> throwing<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> sink<00:01:23.039> it<00:01:23.219> seems

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
I'm used to throwing the sink it seems

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:24.889 
I'm used to throwing the sink it seems
like<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.820> goes<00:01:23.969> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.329> longer

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
like it goes a little longer

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.050 
like it goes a little longer
snaps<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.770> harder<00:01:26.039> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.280> back<00:01:26.429> in<00:01:26.729> but

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
snaps a little harder on the back in but

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.779 
snaps a little harder on the back in but
it's<00:01:27.179> strong<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.899> way

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
it's strong all the way

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's strong all the way
Brian<00:01:29.789> why<00:01:29.939> should<00:01:30.149> everybody<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.719> out<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
Brian why should everybody go out and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.139 
Brian why should everybody go out and
get<00:01:31.049> themselves<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.679> zero<00:01:31.890> gravity<00:01:32.000> it's<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
get themselves a zero gravity it's a

00:01:33.149 --> 00:02:19.940 
get themselves a zero gravity it's a
storm<00:01:33.479> forms<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> greatest

zero-gravity<00:02:23.910> what<00:02:24.209> do<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.599> far<00:02:24.629> I

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
zero-gravity what do you think so far I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.930 
zero-gravity what do you think so far I
actually<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.220> um<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.550> didn't<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:26.790> what

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
actually like it um I didn't know what

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.610 
actually like it um I didn't know what
this<00:02:27.090> thick<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.720> thought<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.230> would<00:02:28.319> be<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.410> lot

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
this thick I thought it would be a lot

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.740 
this thick I thought it would be a lot
more<00:02:28.650> aggressive<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.370> back<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.090> don't

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
more aggressive on the back in I don't

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.390 
more aggressive on the back in I don't
use<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> lot<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> rails<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.040> allowing<00:02:32.340> me

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
use a lot of rails so it's allowing me

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.790 
use a lot of rails so it's allowing me
to<00:02:32.459> really<00:02:32.760> play<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.300> nice<00:02:33.720> smooth<00:02:34.080> line<00:02:34.349> kind

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
to really play a nice smooth line kind

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.130 
to really play a nice smooth line kind
of<00:02:34.920> tight<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:36.180> bump<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
of tight I can bump in a little bit and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
of tight I can bump in a little bit and
mean<00:02:37.349> when<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.890> turns<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.550> turns<00:02:38.849> in<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.269> hard

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
mean when it turns it turns in it's hard

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.630 
mean when it turns it turns in it's hard
but<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.410> controllable<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.550> good

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
but it's controllable so I get a good

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
but it's controllable so I get a good

rough start what do you think of the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.080 
rough start what do you think of the
zero-gravity<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.170> far<00:04:43.410> it's<00:04:43.710> awesome<00:04:44.310> rolls

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
zero-gravity so far it's awesome rolls

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.390 
zero-gravity so far it's awesome rolls
good<00:04:45.390> dick<00:04:46.020> double<00:04:46.290> roll<00:04:46.530> smooth

good dick double roll smooth
I<00:04:48.590> noticed<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.800> polished<00:04:50.250> yours<00:04:50.430> up<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:51.000> your

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
I noticed you polished yours up and your

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.270 
I noticed you polished yours up and your
reason<00:04:51.450> for<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.990> did<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.770> can<00:04:53.100> get<00:04:53.250> a

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
reason for that I did so I can get a

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.240 
reason for that I did so I can get a
little<00:04:53.520> skid<00:04:53.940> out<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.300> it<00:04:54.620> now<00:04:55.620> you've<00:04:56.070> drilled

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
little skid out of it now you've drilled

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.620 
little skid out of it now you've drilled
a<00:04:56.370> lot<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.610> storm<00:04:56.820> balls<00:04:57.060> over<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.420> years

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
a lot of storm balls over the years

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
- you fall I just think it has that

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.210 
- you fall I just think it has that
early<00:05:03.540> roll<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.110> good<00:05:04.350> finish<00:05:04.770> skipping

the<00:05:24.120> zero-gravity<00:05:24.420> for<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.940> don't<00:05:26.940> know<00:05:27.030> it

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
the zero-gravity for you I don't know it

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.210 
the zero-gravity for you I don't know it
seems<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.260> can<00:05:28.440> get<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:28.680> through<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:28.980> head

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
seems like I can get it through the head

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.790 
seems like I can get it through the head
and<00:05:29.490> then<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.450> has<00:05:30.660> what<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.050> need<00:05:31.170> at<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.650> end

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
and then it has what I need at the end

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.560 
and then it has what I need at the end
to<00:05:32.100> finish<00:05:32.250> carry<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.450> carry<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.020> back<00:05:34.200> end

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
to finish carry the carry the back end

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.260 
to finish carry the carry the back end
leann<00:05:36.570> now<00:05:37.530> we<00:05:37.590> know<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:37.919> can't<00:05:38.340> use<00:05:38.610> premier

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
leann now we know you can't use premier

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.000 
leann now we know you can't use premier

I can use this ball this one's gonna be

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.530 
I can use this ball this one's gonna be
my<00:05:46.830> number<00:05:47.220> one<00:05:47.250> premier<00:05:47.820> ball<00:05:48.000> last<00:05:48.270> week

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
my number one premier ball last week

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.450 
my number one premier ball last week
first<00:05:49.169> time<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.500> ever<00:05:49.590> threw<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:49.919> at<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.220> front

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
first time I ever threw it at the front

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
tonight so the best zero gravity wins

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.200 
tonight so the best zero gravity wins
here<00:06:02.070> with<00:06:02.220> Matt<00:06:02.400> Matt<00:06:02.699> what<00:06:02.850> are<00:06:02.940> you<00:06:03.000> seeing

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.629 
here with Matt Matt what are you seeing
out<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:03.479> zero<00:06:03.630> gravity<00:06:03.870> tonight<00:06:04.290> I<00:06:04.560> like<00:06:05.490> how

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
out of zero gravity tonight I like how

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.340 
out of zero gravity tonight I like how
it<00:06:05.790> goes<00:06:05.940> through<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.270> heads<00:06:06.449> it<00:06:06.660> goes<00:06:06.810> and

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
it goes through the heads it goes and

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.530 
it goes through the heads it goes and
then<00:06:07.470> it<00:06:07.560> puts<00:06:07.770> over<00:06:08.040> on<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.250> back<00:06:09.060> end<00:06:09.389> and

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
then it puts over on the back end and

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.530 
then it puts over on the back end and
it's<00:06:09.630> not<00:06:09.810> like<00:06:10.169> overly<00:06:10.680> aggressive<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:12.180> it

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
it's not like overly aggressive so it

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.860 
it's not like overly aggressive so it
just<00:06:12.780> seems<00:06:13.139> just<00:06:13.350> right<00:06:14.450> now<00:06:15.450> Matt<00:06:15.690> you're

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
just seems just right now Matt you're

ball I think that we are gonna sell a

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.529 
ball I think that we are gonna sell a
lot<00:06:26.400> of<00:06:26.430> these<00:06:26.520> balls<00:06:26.729> because<00:06:26.940> this<00:06:27.240> ball<00:06:27.419> is

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
lot of these balls because this ball is
