you have to Kashi with powerless like

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
you have to Kashi with powerless like
yet<00:02:10.229> no<00:02:10.410> longer<00:02:10.619> has<00:02:10.770> his<00:02:10.800> eyes<00:02:11.160> soccer's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

probably<00:02:12.510> power<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> wee

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
probably power down a wee

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.039 
probably power down a wee
and<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.469> there<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.829> no<00:02:15.189> one<00:02:15.519> between<00:02:16.049> Naruto

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
and so there is no one between Naruto

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.920 
and so there is no one between Naruto
and<00:02:17.319> Sasuke<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.980> very<00:02:18.310> fitting<00:02:18.790> final<00:02:19.420> battle<00:02:19.840> I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and Sasuke a very fitting final battle I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.300 
and Sasuke a very fitting final battle I
think<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.379> this<00:02:20.530> series<00:02:20.829> because<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.099> got<00:02:21.219> to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
think for this series because you got to

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.429 
think for this series because you got to
think<00:02:21.459> about<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.670> mean<00:02:21.879> there's<00:02:22.329> nobody<00:02:22.870> that

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
think about I mean there's nobody that

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.990 
think about I mean there's nobody that
could<00:02:23.590> come<00:02:23.859> in<00:02:24.069> between<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.549> battle<00:02:24.819> not

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
could come in between this battle not

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.660 
could come in between this battle not
even<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> tailed<00:02:25.780> beast<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.890> interfere<00:02:27.609> with

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
even the tailed beast can interfere with

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.949 
even the tailed beast can interfere with
this<00:02:28.329> battle

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
this battle

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.920 
this battle
nobody<00:02:29.409> can<00:02:29.769> at<00:02:30.069> all<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:31.000> mean<00:02:31.299> it's<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.569> Kakashi

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
nobody can at all I mean it's a Kakashi

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.990 
nobody can at all I mean it's a Kakashi
and<00:02:32.109> Sakura<00:02:32.590> were<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.890> try<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.159> jump<00:02:33.609> in<00:02:33.760> front

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and Sakura were to try to jump in front

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.800 
and Sakura were to try to jump in front
of<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.299> spot

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
of the spot

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.630 
of the spot
there<00:02:35.019> apparently<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.530> ripped<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.069> tiny

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
there apparently be ripped up in tiny

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.030 
there apparently be ripped up in tiny
little<00:02:36.879> pieces<00:02:37.180> honestly<00:02:37.629> they<00:02:37.900> would<00:02:38.109> and<00:02:38.409> so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
little pieces honestly they would and so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.460 
little pieces honestly they would and so
I<00:02:39.280> think<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.939> chapter<00:02:40.420> really<00:02:40.900> builds<00:02:41.319> up

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
I think this chapter really builds up

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.990 
I think this chapter really builds up
the<00:02:41.590> hype<00:02:41.799> at<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.069> very<00:02:42.310> least<00:02:42.579> this<00:02:42.819> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
the hype at the very least this is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.309 
the hype at the very least this is
something<00:02:43.299> I've<00:02:43.420> been<00:02:43.450> looking<00:02:43.599> forward<00:02:44.109> to

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.969 
it might explain why Sasuke has not been
shown<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.750> last<00:04:02.049> for<00:04:02.470> instance<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.889> the

never been gone it's been hinted at I
really<00:04:49.490> liked<00:04:49.760> how<00:04:49.880> kishimoto<00:04:50.630> really<00:04:51.590> set<00:04:51.920> up

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
really liked how kishimoto really set up

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.530 
really liked how kishimoto really set up
this<00:04:52.340> fight<00:04:52.610> for<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.850> very<00:04:53.000> long<00:04:53.180> time<00:04:53.240> he

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
this fight for a very long time he

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.670 
this fight for a very long time he
definitely<00:04:53.900> did<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.020> right<00:04:54.230> route<00:04:54.470> with

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
definitely did the right route with

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.670 
definitely did the right route with
Sasuke<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.970> just<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:56.420> really<00:04:56.810> think<00:04:57.380> that

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
Sasuke and I just I really think that

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.320 
Sasuke and I just I really think that
dialogue<00:04:58.310> with<00:04:58.520> sauce<00:04:58.730> he's<00:04:58.970> gonna<00:04:59.090> execute

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
dialogue with sauce he's gonna execute

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.750 
dialogue with sauce he's gonna execute
all<00:04:59.900> the<00:04:59.930> go<00:05:00.320> call<00:05:00.530> game<00:05:00.740> like<00:05:00.890> what<00:05:01.100> the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
all the go call game like what the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.000
