00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.880 

just<00:01:44.030> connect<00:01:44.330> all<00:01:44.450> these<00:01:44.630> screws<00:01:45.380> up<00:01:45.590> here

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
just connect all these screws up here

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.469 
just connect all these screws up here
take<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.030> out<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.420> course<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:49.299> step<00:01:50.299> by<00:01:50.450> step

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
take this out of course and step by step

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.429 
take this out of course and step by step
by<00:01:51.080> step<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.860> let's<00:01:52.610> do<00:01:52.759> it

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.330 

see<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.040> did<00:01:58.250> was<00:01:58.509> check<00:01:59.509> out<00:01:59.740> air<00:02:00.740> filter<00:02:01.159> box

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
see we did was check out air filter box

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.560 
see we did was check out air filter box
you'll<00:02:01.880> see<00:02:02.200> screws<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.409> top<00:02:04.119> also<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.390> have

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
you'll see screws on top also you have

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.710 
you'll see screws on top also you have
screws<00:02:05.810> at<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.049> bottom<00:02:07.090> get<00:02:08.090> two<00:02:08.330> screws<00:02:08.569> in

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
screws at the bottom get two screws in

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.110 
screws at the bottom get two screws in
the<00:02:08.780> bottom<00:02:08.950> side<00:02:09.950> let's<00:02:10.160> connect<00:02:10.459> this<00:02:10.700> just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
the bottom side let's connect this just

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.990 
the bottom side let's connect this just
catch<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.800> from<00:02:12.800> whether<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.489> spills<00:02:13.790> now

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
catch that from whether it spills now

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.300 
catch that from whether it spills now
you<00:02:14.330> should<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.630> coil<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.709> three<00:02:16.010> spark

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
you should have coil with a three spark

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.750 
you should have coil with a three spark
plug

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
plug

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.210 
plug

unfortunately now all six are right

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.100 
unfortunately now all six are right
right<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.550> front<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.819> us<00:02:19.910> there's<00:02:20.569> three<00:02:20.900> in

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
right in front of us there's three in

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.650 
right in front of us there's three in
the<00:02:21.200> back<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.459> let's<00:02:22.940> get<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.150> going

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the back so let's get this going

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.630 
the back so let's get this going
now<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.680> next<00:02:24.890> thing<00:02:25.069> I'm<00:02:25.160> going<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.370> do<00:02:25.519> I'm

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
now the next thing I'm going to do I'm

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.670 
now the next thing I'm going to do I'm
going<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.819> take<00:02:25.940> out<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> manifold<00:02:26.680> manifold

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
going to take out the manifold manifold

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.670 
going to take out the manifold manifold
is<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.800> little<00:02:28.010> tricky<00:02:28.340> as<00:02:28.489> about<00:02:29.209> 10<00:02:29.480> volts

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
is a little tricky as about 10 volts

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.620 
is a little tricky as about 10 volts
it's<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:30.860> around<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.450> also<00:02:32.450> these

all right now we are unbolted all the
bolts<00:02:54.049> on<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.349> manifold<00:02:55.450> disconnected<00:02:56.450> all<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
bolts on a manifold disconnected all the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.740 
bolts on a manifold disconnected all the
connectors<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.590> was<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.739> bit<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.099> them<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.750> just

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
connectors it was a bit of them and just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.720 
connectors it was a bit of them and just
make<00:03:00.290> sure<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.560> mark<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.280> mark<00:03:01.519> with<00:03:01.700> a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
make sure you mark it you mark with a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.330 
make sure you mark it you mark with a
large<00:03:02.329> bolts<00:03:02.780> are<00:03:02.959> there<00:03:03.500> are<00:03:03.620> large<00:03:03.890> bolts

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
large bolts are there are large bolts

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.130 
large bolts are there are large bolts
like<00:03:04.519> right<00:03:04.760> here<00:03:05.000> I'll<00:03:05.180> put<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.359> B<00:03:05.569> next<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.989> it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
like right here I'll put a B next to it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.270 
like right here I'll put a B next to it
a<00:03:06.859> lot<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.609> big<00:03:07.970> big<00:03:08.510> boats<00:03:08.810> small<00:03:09.140> boats<00:03:09.530> to

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
a lot of big big boats small boats to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.069 
a lot of big big boats small boats to
just<00:03:10.459> remember<00:03:10.910> there<00:03:11.209> are<00:03:11.239> three<00:03:11.359> bolts<00:03:11.870> in

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
just remember there are three bolts in

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.920 
just remember there are three bolts in
the<00:03:12.170> back<00:03:12.200> very<00:03:12.590> difficult<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.190> get<00:03:13.310> did<00:03:13.700> so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
the back very difficult to get did so

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.559 
the back very difficult to get did so
now<00:03:14.930> as<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.290> can<00:03:15.500> see<00:03:16.000> they<00:03:17.000> matter<00:03:17.239> for<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
now as you can see they matter for the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.259 
now as you can see they matter for the
door<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.829> was<00:03:18.950> exposed<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:20.030> course

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
door and that was exposed is of course

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.539 
door and that was exposed is of course
the<00:03:20.420> coils<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.530> three<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:21.889> them<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.370> back

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
the coils the three of them in the back

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.539 
the coils the three of them in the back
and<00:03:22.760> also<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.299> gaskets<00:03:23.810> we're<00:03:24.799> not<00:03:24.920> done<00:03:25.100> yet

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
and also the gaskets we're not done yet

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.400 
and also the gaskets we're not done yet
we're<00:03:26.209> going<00:03:26.359> to<00:03:26.450> have<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.660> dislocate<00:03:27.170> this

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
we're going to have to dislocate this

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.080 
we're going to have to dislocate this
gets<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.160> bolts<00:03:28.400> out<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.639> here<00:03:28.760> because

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
gets it the bolts out of here because

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.110 
gets it the bolts out of here because
the<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.600> lower<00:03:30.340> gaskets<00:03:31.340> are<00:03:31.549> underneath

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the the lower gaskets are underneath

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.190 
the the lower gaskets are underneath
here<00:03:32.450> let's<00:03:33.139> do<00:03:33.290> it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
here let's do it

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.260 
here let's do it
alright<00:03:36.200> goes<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.470> next<00:03:36.590> step

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
alright goes the next step

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.520 
alright goes the next step
so<00:03:38.900> call<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.170> bolt<00:03:39.410> out<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:40.520> the<00:03:40.730> upper<00:03:41.530> gasp

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
so call the bolt out of the upper gasp

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.860 
so call the bolt out of the upper gasp
with<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:42.920> upper<00:03:43.190> gaskets<00:03:43.670> act<00:03:43.910> as<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.720> can

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
with the upper gaskets act as you can

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.080 
with the upper gaskets act as you can
see<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.290> covered<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.040> holes<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.610> don't<00:03:46.880> want<00:03:47.000> to

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
see I covered the holes I don't want to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780 
see I covered the holes I don't want to
make<00:03:47.480> sure<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.690> cover<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.460> took<00:03:49.460> out<00:03:49.580> some

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
make sure you cover that took out some

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.020 
make sure you cover that took out some
bolts<00:03:50.060> over<00:03:50.180> here<00:03:50.450> as<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.630> can<00:03:50.660> see<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:52.490> there

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
bolts over here as you can see and there

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.270 
bolts over here as you can see and there
was<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> connector<00:03:53.720> over<00:03:53.750> here<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.100> see

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
was a connector over here you can see

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.350 
was a connector over here you can see
there's<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.490> little<00:03:55.670> connector

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
there's a little connector

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.140 
there's a little connector
I<00:03:56.590> didn't<00:03:57.590> disconnect<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.430> because<00:03:58.850> I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
I didn't disconnect to that because I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.060 
I didn't disconnect to that because I
have<00:03:59.510> access<00:04:00.020> now<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.560> lower<00:04:02.590> lower<00:04:03.590> intake

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
have access now to lower lower intake

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.950 
have access now to lower lower intake
manifold<00:04:04.670> gaskets<00:04:05.270> as<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.630> can<00:04:05.780> see<00:04:05.870> I'm

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
manifold gaskets as you can see I'm

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.350 
manifold gaskets as you can see I'm
gonna<00:04:06.050> replace<00:04:06.350> those<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:07.580> I'm<00:04:08.120> going<00:04:08.270> to

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
bit over here we made it pretty nice

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.830 
bit over here we made it pretty nice
just<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.170> install<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.710> new<00:04:21.739> gaskets<00:04:22.720> or<00:04:23.720> you

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
just to install the new gaskets or you

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.110 
just to install the new gaskets or you
can<00:04:24.020> see<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.560> old<00:04:24.680> ones<00:04:24.950> were<00:04:25.130> not<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.910> bad

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
can see the old ones were not that bad

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.540 
can see the old ones were not that bad
but<00:04:26.450> just<00:04:26.720> don't<00:04:27.470> want<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.740> replace<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.310> I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
but just don't want to replace it I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.030 
but just don't want to replace it I
clean<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> little<00:04:29.360> bit<00:04:29.480> inside<00:04:29.750> here<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.200> little

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
clean a little bit inside here a little

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.080 
clean a little bit inside here a little
bit<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:31.490> not<00:04:31.940> too<00:04:32.000> much<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:34.700> next<00:04:34.940> step

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
bit but not too much and the next step

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.930 
bit but not too much and the next step
is<00:04:35.270> putting<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.930> back<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.550> onto<00:04:37.550> all

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
is putting that back in and onto all

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.820 
is putting that back in and onto all
right<00:04:38.090> we<00:04:38.210> just<00:04:38.240> finished<00:04:38.990> putting<00:04:39.680> in

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
right we just finished putting in

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.860 
right we just finished putting in
installing<00:04:40.430> new<00:04:40.580> gaskets<00:04:41.120> in<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.570> upper

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
installing new gaskets in the upper

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.230 
installing new gaskets in the upper
intake<00:04:42.350> they<00:04:43.190> were<00:04:43.250> pretty<00:04:43.460> thick<00:04:43.790> these<00:04:44.030> are

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
intake they were pretty thick these are

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.030 
intake they were pretty thick these are
the<00:04:44.330> old<00:04:44.510> ones<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:46.310> was<00:04:46.490> too<00:04:46.700> bad<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:47.470> I'm<00:04:48.470> kind

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
the old ones it was too bad but I'm kind

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.100 
the old ones it was too bad but I'm kind
of<00:04:49.070> afraid<00:04:49.370> because<00:04:49.730> these<00:04:50.360> look<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.870> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
of afraid because these look like the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.100 
of afraid because these look like the
original<00:04:51.830> I'm<00:04:52.040> not<00:04:52.970> certain<00:04:53.420> if<00:04:53.630> somebody

might<00:04:54.230> know<00:04:54.470> but<00:04:54.740> if<00:04:55.160> these<00:04:55.370> are<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.700> original

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
might know but if these are the original

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.540 
might know but if these are the original
ones<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.110> 2004<00:04:57.860> that's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
ones and this is a 2004 that's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.790 
ones and this is a 2004 that's
ridiculous<00:04:59.180> but<00:04:59.720> whatever

as<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.730> alright<00:05:02.150> we<00:05:02.240> just<00:05:02.270> finished<00:05:02.750> up<00:05:02.900> with

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
as you alright we just finished up with

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.630 
as you alright we just finished up with
the<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.910> upper<00:05:05.210> intake<00:05:05.590> gaskets<00:05:06.590> now<00:05:07.220> I'm

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
the the upper intake gaskets now I'm

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.480 
the the upper intake gaskets now I'm
going<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.910> do<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.750> spark<00:05:09.080> plugs<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:10.220> I'm<00:05:10.340> just

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
going to do the spark plugs so I'm just

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.310 
going to do the spark plugs so I'm just
going<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:10.700> here<00:05:11.300> you<00:05:11.390> see<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.720> boat<00:05:11.900> yeah<00:05:12.260> you

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
going to here you see the boat yeah you

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.780 
going to here you see the boat yeah you
have<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.590> take<00:05:12.770> out<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.220> each<00:05:13.340> one<00:05:13.580> for<00:05:13.700> the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
have to take out and each one for the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.640 
have to take out and each one for the
coils<00:05:14.180> I'm<00:05:14.510> an<00:05:14.690> analyzer<00:05:15.080> coils<00:05:15.440> make<00:05:15.560> sure

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
coils I'm an analyzer coils make sure

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.040 
coils I'm an analyzer coils make sure
the<00:05:15.740> cords<00:05:15.980> all<00:05:16.070> right<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.540> we<00:05:17.540> place<00:05:17.720> them<00:05:17.840> on

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
the cords all right and we place them on

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.610 
the cords all right and we place them on
spark<00:05:18.410> plugs<00:05:19.930> alright<00:05:20.930> we<00:05:21.020> just<00:05:21.050> took<00:05:21.320> out<00:05:21.500> the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
spark plugs alright we just took out the

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.350 
spark plugs alright we just took out the
coil<00:05:21.890> as<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.520> can<00:05:22.700> see<00:05:23.470> start<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.650> too<00:05:24.890> bad

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
coil as you can see start that too bad

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.300 
coil as you can see start that too bad
so<00:05:26.360> I'm<00:05:26.420> not<00:05:26.540> going<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.780> change<00:05:27.020> them<00:05:27.350> I<00:05:27.590> have

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
so I'm not going to change them I have

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.460 
so I'm not going to change them I have
the<00:05:28.460> spark<00:05:28.730> plug<00:05:28.970> here<00:05:29.390> they<00:05:30.020> had<00:05:30.170> a<00:05:30.200> pretty

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
the spark plug here they had a pretty

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.560 
the spark plug here they had a pretty
good<00:05:30.590> set<00:05:31.280> here<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:33.160> g'kar's<00:05:34.160> so<00:05:35.120> really<00:05:35.390> nice

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
good set here and g'kar's so really nice

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.710 
good set here and g'kar's so really nice
so<00:05:36.520> they<00:05:37.520> look<00:05:37.700> too<00:05:37.880> bad<00:05:38.060> but<00:05:38.330> I'm<00:05:38.420> still<00:05:38.630> going

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
so they look too bad but I'm still going

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.080 
so they look too bad but I'm still going
to<00:05:38.810> change<00:05:39.020> them<00:05:39.170> on<00:05:40.130> as<00:05:40.370> you<00:05:40.490> can<00:05:40.610> see<00:05:40.790> that's

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
to change them on as you can see that's

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.750 
to change them on as you can see that's
the<00:05:41.270> first<00:05:41.510> one<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.590> we're<00:05:42.710> going<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.860> go<00:05:43.040> and

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
the first one and we're going to go and

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.860 
the first one and we're going to go and
we<00:05:43.880> place<00:05:44.120> all<00:05:45.070> all<00:05:46.070> right

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.149 

all<00:05:49.870> right<00:05:50.050> we<00:05:50.139> just<00:05:50.349> installed<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.860> spark

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
all right we just installed the spark

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.719 
all right we just installed the spark
plugs<00:05:52.229> as<00:05:53.229> you<00:05:53.349> can<00:05:53.500> see<00:05:53.650> tying<00:05:54.220> them<00:05:54.400> back<00:05:54.520> up

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
plugs as you can see tying them back up

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.700 
plugs as you can see tying them back up
now<00:05:55.090> it's<00:05:55.240> time<00:05:55.389> for<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.629> manifold<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.319> clean

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
now it's time for the manifold I clean

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.969 
now it's time for the manifold I clean
it<00:05:56.740> up<00:05:56.919> a<00:05:57.009> little<00:05:57.129> bit<00:05:58.289> now<00:05:59.289> we<00:05:59.349> drop<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.889> in

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
it up a little bit now we drop it in

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:06.240 
it up a little bit now we drop it in
there<00:06:02.370> and<00:06:04.379> just<00:06:05.379> make<00:06:05.530> sure<00:06:05.740> you<00:06:05.949> remember

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
there and just make sure you remember

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.399 
there and just make sure you remember
where<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.669> bolts<00:06:06.879> all<00:06:07.060> right<00:06:07.210> we<00:06:07.960> did<00:06:08.139> mark

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
where the bolts all right we did mark

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.709 
where the bolts all right we did mark
them<00:06:08.620> remember<00:06:09.490> you<00:06:09.520> got<00:06:09.729> three<00:06:10.449> of<00:06:10.479> them<00:06:10.569> in

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719 
them remember you got three of them in

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.140 
them remember you got three of them in
the<00:06:10.810> back<00:06:11.110> as<00:06:11.469> you<00:06:11.770> can<00:06:12.009> see<00:06:12.250> one<00:06:12.639> right<00:06:12.669> here

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
the back as you can see one right here

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.929 
the back as you can see one right here
one<00:06:14.020> over<00:06:14.050> here<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:14.830> you<00:06:15.099> got<00:06:15.219> one<00:06:15.430> all<00:06:15.610> the

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
one over here and you got one all the

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.760 
one over here and you got one all the
way<00:06:16.000> at<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.150> bottom<00:06:16.389> here<00:06:16.780> this<00:06:17.319> is<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.620> one

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
way at the bottom here this is the one

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.339 
way at the bottom here this is the one
that<00:06:17.889> might<00:06:18.250> get<00:06:18.669> you<00:06:18.909> so<00:06:19.150> just<00:06:19.750> remember<00:06:20.169> and

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
that might get you so just remember and

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.350 
that might get you so just remember and
all<00:06:20.469> the<00:06:20.620> connections<00:06:21.190> I'll<00:06:21.400> remember<00:06:22.030> with

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
all the connections I'll remember with

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.930 
all the connections I'll remember with
all<00:06:22.509> the<00:06:22.659> connection<00:06:23.139> goes<00:06:26.099> into<00:06:27.099> place<00:06:27.340> now

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
all the connection goes into place now

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.100 
all the connection goes into place now
what<00:06:28.659> I'm<00:06:28.750> going<00:06:28.870> to<00:06:28.930> do<00:06:29.080> is<00:06:29.319> put<00:06:29.830> back<00:06:31.110> the

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
what I'm going to do is put back the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.420 
what I'm going to do is put back the
filter<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:33.069> box<00:06:34.030> and<00:06:34.919> I'm<00:06:35.919> going<00:06:35.949> to<00:06:36.069> start<00:06:36.310> it

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
filter the box and I'm going to start it

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.749 
filter the box and I'm going to start it
up

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
up

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.279 
up
hopefully<00:06:37.270> I'll<00:06:37.389> take<00:06:37.629> away<00:06:37.840> that<00:06:37.960> hesitation

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
hopefully I'll take away that hesitation

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.100 
hopefully I'll take away that hesitation
or<00:06:38.860> I<00:06:39.460> understand<00:06:39.909> if<00:06:40.090> that<00:06:40.120> doesn't<00:06:40.690> work

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
or I understand if that doesn't work

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.610 
or I understand if that doesn't work
my<00:06:41.650> next<00:06:41.949> project<00:06:42.870> will<00:06:43.870> probably<00:06:44.020> be<00:06:44.319> the<00:06:44.409> old

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
my next project will probably be the old

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.070 
my next project will probably be the old
rings<00:06:45.599> -<00:06:46.599> oh<00:06:46.629> the<00:06:47.020> the<00:06:47.500> imto<00:06:48.129> rings<00:06:48.580> and<00:06:49.080> just

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
rings - oh the the imto rings and just

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.019 
rings - oh the the imto rings and just
replace<00:06:50.349> those<00:06:50.680> I'm<00:06:50.919> guessing<00:06:51.460> a<00:06:51.550> job<00:06:51.759> take

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:52.029 
replace those I'm guessing a job take

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:53.909 
replace those I'm guessing a job take
this<00:06:52.180> whole<00:06:52.419> thing<00:06:52.659> out<00:06:52.779> or<00:06:52.990> maybe<00:06:53.199> some<00:06:53.830> I

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
this whole thing out or maybe some I

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.480 
this whole thing out or maybe some I
might<00:06:54.099> know<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.550> better<00:06:54.849> way<00:06:55.919> if<00:06:56.919> that<00:06:57.159> doesn't

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
might know a better way if that doesn't

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.249 
might know a better way if that doesn't
work<00:06:57.580> of<00:06:57.729> course<00:06:57.759> a<00:06:58.120> knock<00:06:58.330> sensor<00:06:58.840> which<00:06:59.050> was

00:06:59.249 --> 00:06:59.259 
work of course a knock sensor which was

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.180 
work of course a knock sensor which was
