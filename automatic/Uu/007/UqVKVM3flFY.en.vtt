00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.290 
but I just wanted to put this out there
because<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.469> genuinely<00:05:39.159> does<00:05:39.250> seem<00:05:39.759> the<00:05:40.029> EA

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
because it genuinely does seem the EA

going<00:06:38.740> to<00:06:38.800> probably<00:06:39.039> come<00:06:39.190> out<00:06:39.280> and<00:06:39.490> claim

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
going to probably come out and claim

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.249 
going to probably come out and claim
that<00:06:39.729> if<00:06:40.000> they<00:06:40.150> don't<00:06:40.330> even<00:06:40.479> address<00:06:41.110> this

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
that if they don't even address this

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:42.930 
that if they don't even address this
situation<00:06:41.710> at<00:06:41.800> all<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:42.069> is<00:06:42.159> totally<00:06:42.639> totally

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
situation at all that is totally totally

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.270 
situation at all that is totally totally
rubbish<00:06:43.419> if<00:06:43.720> they're<00:06:44.289> not<00:06:44.409> impact<00:06:44.830> literally

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
rubbish if they're not impact literally

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.619 
rubbish if they're not impact literally
where<00:06:45.400> everyone<00:06:45.789> is<00:06:45.879> open<00:06:46.000> and<00:06:46.270> if<00:06:46.360> then<00:06:46.539> on

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
where everyone is open and if then on

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.119 
where everyone is open and if then on
the<00:06:46.720> market<00:06:47.020> when<00:06:47.139> everyone<00:06:47.470> is<00:06:47.560> opening<00:06:48.069> the

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
the market when everyone is opening the

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.999 
the market when everyone is opening the
packs<00:06:48.340> they're<00:06:48.909> not<00:06:49.090> on<00:06:49.180> the<00:06:49.270> market<00:06:49.659> when

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
packs they're not on the market when

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.749 
packs they're not on the market when
twelve<00:06:51.009> hours<00:06:51.370> later

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
twelve hours later

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.730 
twelve hours later
whatever<00:06:52.240> is<00:06:52.509> even<00:06:53.050> more<00:06:53.229> than<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.560> later

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
whatever is even more than that later

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.409 
whatever is even more than that later
it's<00:06:53.979> absolutely<00:06:54.430> ridiculous<00:06:54.729> so<00:06:55.030> it's

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
it's absolutely ridiculous so it's

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.309 
it's absolutely ridiculous so it's
definitely<00:06:55.750> not<00:06:55.840> that<00:06:56.020> they're<00:06:56.169> probably

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
definitely not that they're probably

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.080 
definitely not that they're probably
also<00:06:56.560> going<00:06:56.740> to<00:06:56.800> claim<00:06:56.979> that<00:06:57.490> it's<00:06:57.819> because

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
also going to claim that it's because

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.670 
also going to claim that it's because
they're<00:06:58.210> just<00:06:58.419> this<00:06:58.659> price<00:06:58.870> band<00:06:59.110> and<00:06:59.289> made<00:06:59.530> it

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
they're just this price band and made it

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.469 
they're just this price band and made it
more<00:06:59.860> realistic<00:07:00.190> again<00:07:00.729> he<00:07:01.030> used<00:07:01.180> to<00:07:01.330> sell

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
more realistic again he used to sell

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.420 
more realistic again he used to sell
instantly<00:07:01.900> for<00:07:02.020> 500k<00:07:02.530> and<00:07:02.830> now<00:07:02.919> he<00:07:02.979> doesn't

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
instantly for 500k and now he doesn't

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.219 
instantly for 500k and now he doesn't
sell<00:07:03.580> for<00:07:03.759> 390<00:07:04.449> so<00:07:04.569> that<00:07:04.659> it's<00:07:04.780> also<00:07:04.990> an

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
sell for 390 so that it's also an

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.110 
sell for 390 so that it's also an
absolutely<00:07:05.560> loads<00:07:05.740> of<00:07:05.889> rubbish<00:07:06.009> so<00:07:06.699> really

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
absolutely loads of rubbish so really

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.209 
absolutely loads of rubbish so really
the<00:07:07.240> only<00:07:07.270> explanation<00:07:08.020> is<00:07:08.169> that<00:07:08.259> divide<00:07:09.069> that

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:09.219 
the only explanation is that divide that

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.459 
the only explanation is that divide that
lower<00:07:09.550> does<00:07:09.789> card<00:07:10.240> weight<00:07:10.509> and<00:07:10.750> put<00:07:11.199> him<00:07:11.319> so

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:11.469 
lower does card weight and put him so

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:12.809 
lower does card weight and put him so
that<00:07:11.560> he<00:07:11.650> comes<00:07:11.740> off<00:07:11.949> on<00:07:11.979> more<00:07:12.250> packs<00:07:12.490> because

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
that he comes off on more packs because

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.070 
that he comes off on more packs because
they<00:07:12.940> realized<00:07:13.300> that<00:07:13.419> there<00:07:13.569> was<00:07:13.690> none<00:07:13.870> on<00:07:13.960> the

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
they realized that there was none on the

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.170 
they realized that there was none on the
