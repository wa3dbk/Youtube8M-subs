Dodge<00:01:45.830> Ram<00:01:46.130> pickup<00:01:46.640> truck<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.150> that<00:01:47.600> has<00:01:47.780> been

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
Dodge Ram pickup truck and that has been

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.660 
Dodge Ram pickup truck and that has been
a<00:01:47.990> very<00:01:48.140> special<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:49.130> successful

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
a very special and successful

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.690 
a very special and successful
partnership<00:01:50.240> for<00:01:51.110> us<00:01:51.140> for<00:01:51.500> many<00:01:51.680> years<00:01:51.799> we've

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
partnership for us for many years we've

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.610 
partnership for us for many years we've
moved<00:01:52.970> on<00:01:53.180> from<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.510> five<00:01:53.720> point<00:01:54.049> nine<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
moved on from the five point nine to the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.469 
moved on from the five point nine to the
six<00:01:54.890> point<00:01:55.159> seven<00:01:55.430> that's<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:55.970> your<00:01:56.180> truck

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
six point seven that's in your truck

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.510 
six point seven that's in your truck
which<00:01:57.049> allowed<00:01:57.380> us<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.620> increase<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.159> power

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
which allowed us to increase the power

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.170 
which allowed us to increase the power
increase<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.420> torque<00:01:59.720> reduce<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.799> noise<00:02:01.180> and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
increase the torque reduce the noise and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.090 
increase the torque reduce the noise and
then<00:02:02.540> because<00:02:03.200> we<00:02:03.350> had<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.560> clean<00:02:03.799> up<00:02:03.830> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
then because we had to clean up the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.649 
then because we had to clean up the
exhaust<00:02:04.400> we<00:02:04.790> had<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.090> add<00:02:05.240> some

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
exhaust we had to add some

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.840 
exhaust we had to add some
after-treatment<00:02:06.290> technology<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.369> that's

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
after-treatment technology and that's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.789 
after-treatment technology and that's
very<00:02:08.119> special<00:02:08.420> some<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.959> those<00:02:09.080> technologies

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
very special some of those technologies

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.320 
very special some of those technologies
are<00:02:09.830> introduced<00:02:10.429> for<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.670> first<00:02:10.910> time<00:02:11.150> in

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
are introduced for the first time in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.940 
are introduced for the first time in
history<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.320> really<00:02:12.590> ought<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.799> learn

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
history and you really ought to learn

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.530 
history and you really ought to learn
about<00:02:13.640> those<00:02:13.880> as<00:02:14.120> well

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
about those as well

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.270 
about those as well
oh<00:02:14.570> absolutely<00:02:14.810> well<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.830> phrases<00:02:16.250> we

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
oh absolutely well one of the phrases we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.130 
oh absolutely well one of the phrases we
have<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> Cummins<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.269> innovation<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.989> can

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
have it Cummins is innovation you can

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.780 
have it Cummins is innovation you can
depend<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.549> not<00:02:19.760> just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
depend on we know that it's not just

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.789 
depend on we know that it's not just
about<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.600> technology<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:21.590> about

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
about the technology but it's about

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.100 
about the technology but it's about
delivering<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.239> it's<00:02:23.360> reliable<00:02:23.720> when

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
delivering it so that it's reliable when

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.890 
delivering it so that it's reliable when
our<00:02:24.200> customers<00:02:24.830> receive<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.820> we've<00:02:26.330> got<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.570> lot

I would love to do that terrific talking
to<00:02:53.570> John<00:02:53.810> Wall<00:02:54.050> was<00:02:54.230> great<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.220> figured

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
to John Wall was great but we figured

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.550 
to John Wall was great but we figured
there<00:02:55.700> was<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.820> lot<00:02:56.030> more<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.330> see<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.690> fact<00:02:57.350> he

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
there was a lot more to see in fact he

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.170 
there was a lot more to see in fact he
mentioned<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:58.010> testing<00:02:58.400> Cummins<00:02:58.760> does<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
mentioned the testing Cummins does and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.350 
mentioned the testing Cummins does and
how<00:02:59.240> they<00:02:59.360> have<00:02:59.510> their<00:02:59.630> own<00:02:59.720> test<00:03:00.020> track

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
how they have their own test track

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.540 
how they have their own test track
