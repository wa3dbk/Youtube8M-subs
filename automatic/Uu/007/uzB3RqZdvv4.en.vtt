00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi beautiful this video will be about 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 wash we love the police product by 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 a strange coincidence 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.990
 again it's the turn of the line 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.330
 eyebrow liner 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 and eyeliner and with you I still 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.029
 I will reveal both a very handy trick that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.199
 lets make stunning colors 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.519
 natural so beige-pink or 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.960
 the pale pink shade of kayala which 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.150
 hold inheritance visa 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 and also at the end of the video for those who are very 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 asked he goes to instagram tv 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 I'll show you my cute kitty code 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.850
 product months this time I mean 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.989
 gel eyeliner and okay either 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
 cream eyeliner 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.520
 products have a number of drawbacks of course 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 around many other liner he 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.660
 also dries out minus the brand 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.489
 it is all the same until no news available 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.120
 on the rather accessible it is not the most 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.000
 affordable 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 Well, the weather is not very plastic quite 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 quick grab sometimes I would like 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 a little bit more time to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.629
 to shade 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.300
 but then I consider these possible disadvantages 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.430
 the layering compensates us with its brightness 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 unfortunately there is no resistance 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.110
 beige shade but its basically possible 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.070
 look and yourself very very 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.940
 pigmented 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.370
 Klimov and pleasant 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.560
 work but this is not the most important thing 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.260
 the main thing is that in my opinion this eyeliner 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.300
 still the most resistant way to fail 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.010
 century 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.220
 I practice my practice in school 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.220
 makeup just recognizing the views of the model 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.150
 students it turned out that this eyeliner one 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.550
 of the most 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.020
 if not the most resistant on the market 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 which can only be 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 moreover it is on the mucous on vape 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.410
 really the most resistant so far i 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.660
 found compares even the most persistent 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.760
 my love with smaller pencils urban 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.520
 decay pranksters forced to admit that 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.160
 average most people have these eyeliners 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.590
 holding on longer just done already 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.750
 that they grabbed now even a napkin for 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.070
 withdrawals to be I can not literally wash off 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 only oily different means 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.510
 good or washed off stylishly and efficiently 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.090
 legs in general i know about stationary and 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.520
 color hayala in different pencils and other 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.960
 keep gel layers pretty good 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.030
 in touch skii almost ax 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.800
 but with the light and the problem of gold that 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.170
 beige unfortunately pencil a 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.569
 you carped all day until these 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.670
 baby blades 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 very side and still fighting therefore 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.209
 I offer you the following if you want 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.389
 get beige peach pencil 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.430
 type orange eyeliner white together 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:27.489
 if you want to get a light pink 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.560
 then I have a pink and white tarantula 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.329
 but I will mix yellow pink want 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.370
 hold orange song 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.909
 so I used to be his mother a little bit 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.030
 adding cute 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.180
 I sit and light in beige pepper 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.290
 eyeliner 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.719
 distribute ciliary evil 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.419
 if you wear faces it is a little imitate 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.139
 finger a century to immediately pour is not yet 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.569
 imprinted 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.370
 this very effect is more open 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.709
 there was damp smelling in class action 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.709
 let's make a pink combination 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.939
 I think that the difference is visible but not obvious 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.459
 peach looks more beige 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.890
 and pink looks whiter or even 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.900
 somehow white lilac respectively 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.329
 peach course would be even stronger 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.340
 highlight blue eyes green eyes here 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.900
 even brighter on the background of pink with red 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.069
 pigment 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.650
 I hope that you were interested in these 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.629
 I wanted on the corps here at the request 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.629
 workers here such a call fox 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.820
 will cause a maximum 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.820
 bye Bye
