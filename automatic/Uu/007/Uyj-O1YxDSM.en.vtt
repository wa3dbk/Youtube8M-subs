00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629

as well as well as that way you can go

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540 
as well as well as that way you can go
in<00:01:47.690> multiple<00:01:48.080> directions<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.190> gets<00:01:49.490> a

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
in multiple directions it just gets a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.650 
in multiple directions it just gets a
little<00:01:49.580> bit<00:01:49.850> annoying<00:01:50.120> because<00:01:50.360> there's<00:01:50.600> a
