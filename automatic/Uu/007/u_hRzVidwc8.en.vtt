00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello, guys, I'm going to go there today. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.980
 own helmet 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.160
 I wanted to show the process to you. 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:16.279
 that I will use with the lateral support 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 currently on goal for and fixer 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:33.120
 Using hinged along the base pin 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:38.879
 side of helmet helmet is an escort 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 is an ex u 1,000 helmet has a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.550
 inconvenience 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.550
 I really would like to put the camera 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 on here 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.489
 so a curved arm is the position that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.170
 I liked it the most 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.170
 until today but unfortunately no longer allows 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 so for now I'm saving the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.640
 on the top I do not think it gets much 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 probably far from the mind will put 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 But today I want to put it here. 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.369
 beginning of the story and I'll show you 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.229
 process for you a second 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.820
 convenience is that air intake 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.720
 leaving a relief that does not allow 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 that Brazil be set apart from the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.009
 from that point and it is precisely where 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.009
 we are going to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:50.240
 so we have to take out the plastic 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.969
 3m insulation protector 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.630
 it is not a task an 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:07.549
 easy but with persistence we 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:09.920
 we can is important that the area of 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.200
 helmet to be trained 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.810
 welcome write on fabric for 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.319
 clean lenses and remove grease or 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.440
 any dirt and have here so that the 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.540
 fixation is the best possible 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.569
 I'll put him a little inclined 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.829
 to follow the design of the helmet in the well 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.829
 on the edge of your small bass 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:03:01.200
 Well, here it is, but we 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:03.180
 we need to make interesting pressure there 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.709
 pressure to be applied in all 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.709
 adhesive ends 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.290
 if you put a sticker on it, sorry 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.730
 the hope 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:27.950
 yet not for you to recover sticker 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:33.150
 only to remove and discard people 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:39.299
 taking the hair dryer out of shape 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:44.040
 that the heat it adelahes having the glue and 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:48.049
 it breaks its structure a bit and gives 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.609
 to withdraw but can not reuse 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.609
 so it got more or less 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:07.199
 she already foresees a little of the use of the helmet 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:11.910
 which should follow the lines put the 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:15.229
 long arm to make the camera easier 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.769
 of the helmet 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:23.370
 this distance she does not hit anyone who stays 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.430
 aligned arm and shorter arm will serve 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.479
 base, thus preventing any 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.479
 tremor occurs 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:48.610
 inverted cicchitto the short screw has 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:56.010
 Come here and I'll put another short 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:05:04.680
 here and now on camera 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:04.680
 I vow in the long run to fit her 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.820
 The way it is here, I can not 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.820
 put the long screw notes 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:26.070
 It hits here, in that case I have to 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:28.240
 untie here and reverse the inversion 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.260
 screw back 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:41.220
 for me to the right and then put the 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:45.600
 but long screw reinserting 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.600
 put the short in the final again 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:04.780
 any adjustment therefrom is 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:15.410
 done the following way she accepts now 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:19.009
 the lateral adjustments also vertical 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.820
 then the regulation will be complete 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:27.789
 I'll call her wifi here to show 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:31.090
 the image that is already obtainable here 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.090
 played pro 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.600
 Turn on the camera 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:48.990
 this image the camera is taking 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.990
 she is taking this region of the helmet 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:07:03.690
 the rest is the vision then reminding her 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:07.510
 can adjust up vertically 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:12.280
 giving a little more angle on the street 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:16.680
 the impact of the bike and can still close the 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.680
 angle laterally or open 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.530
 Similarly 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.530
 that's it 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:40.920
 this is the final aspect but it can also 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:43.820
 here ok 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.820
 to the next
