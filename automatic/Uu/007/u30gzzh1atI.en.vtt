00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
gonna go so I'm gonna do basically a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520 
gonna go so I'm gonna do basically a
full<00:02:05.520> run<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.299> again<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.350> in

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
full run is I know it's again that's in

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.880 
full run is I know it's again that's in
like<00:02:07.680> some<00:02:07.890> sort<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.220> slow-motion<00:02:08.700> mode<00:02:09.119> uh

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
like some sort of slow-motion mode uh

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.170 
like some sort of slow-motion mode uh
you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.190> game<00:02:11.340> doesn't<00:02:11.610> work<00:02:11.730> too<00:02:12.150> well

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you know this game doesn't work too well

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.940 
you know this game doesn't work too well
with<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> capture<00:02:13.110> at<00:02:13.170> least<00:02:13.230> am<00:02:13.560> I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
with the capture at least am I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.479 
with the capture at least am I
anyways<00:02:14.400> higher<00:02:15.209> mo<00:02:16.140> max<00:02:16.500> slower<00:02:16.920> any<00:02:17.069> bullets

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
anyways higher mo max slower any bullets

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.170 
anyways higher mo max slower any bullets
melee<00:02:18.300> range<00:02:18.599> or<00:02:18.840> better<00:02:19.050> accuracy<00:02:19.940> that's<00:02:20.940> to

melee range or better accuracy that's to
higher<00:02:21.480> mo<00:02:22.170> max<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.400> generate<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
higher mo max that's gonna generate the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.680 
higher mo max that's gonna generate the
new<00:02:23.970> level<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.569> we'll<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.769> that

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
new level and we'll go on and see that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.000 
new level and we'll go on and see that
interesting<00:02:27.690> thing<00:02:27.900> about<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.950> know

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
interesting thing about it is you know

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.229 
interesting thing about it is you know
it's<00:02:29.190> similar<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.450> old<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:31.290> doom<00:02:31.650> or

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
it's similar to the old like doom or

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's similar to the old like doom or
Wolfenstein<00:02:33.239> games<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.709> everything<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.190> just

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
Wolfenstein games so everything is just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.190 
Wolfenstein games so everything is just
kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.640> straight<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.569> there

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
kind of like straight up and down there

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.809 
kind of like straight up and down there
you<00:02:37.230> can't<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.800> look<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.459> can't<00:02:38.670> look

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
you can't like look up you can't look

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.000 
you can't like look up you can't look
down<00:02:39.170> good<00:02:40.170> thing<00:02:40.349> about<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.709> like<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
down good thing about it like the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.780 
down good thing about it like the
maggots<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.610> are<00:02:41.760> normally<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.650> like

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
maggots that are normally you know like

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.520 
maggots that are normally you know like
flush<00:02:44.790> against<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.450> ground<00:02:45.660> they're<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.290> too

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
flush against the ground they're not too

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.729 
flush against the ground they're not too
difficult<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:47.040> utter<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:49.110> everything<00:02:49.530> it's

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
difficult to utter and everything it's

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.650 
difficult to utter and everything it's
if<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.130> could<00:02:50.280> shoot<00:02:50.459> something<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.360> shoot

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
if you could shoot something you shoot

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.140 
if you could shoot something you shoot
everything<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:53.099> nothing's<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> be<00:02:53.790> you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
everything so nothing's going to be you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.610 
everything so nothing's going to be you
know<00:02:54.239> too<00:02:54.299> high<00:02:54.660> or<00:02:54.900> too<00:02:55.079> low<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.470> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
know too high or too low that you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.920 
know too high or too low that you
wouldn't<00:02:55.829> be<00:02:55.920> able<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> normally<00:02:56.579> hit<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> uh<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
wouldn't be able to normally hit it uh I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.130 
wouldn't be able to normally hit it uh I
ran<00:02:58.709> out<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.920> bullets<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.299> I'm<00:03:00.599> using<00:03:00.840> this

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
ran out of bullets so I'm using this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.960 
ran out of bullets so I'm using this
sledgehammer<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.340> though<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.579> doesn't<00:03:02.790> have

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
sledgehammer and though it doesn't have

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.289 
sledgehammer and though it doesn't have
the<00:03:03.299> greatest<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.930> all<00:03:04.110> effects<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.880> still

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
the greatest of all effects I can still

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.850 
the greatest of all effects I can still
hit<00:03:06.780> some<00:03:07.110> things<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.560> suppose

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
hit some things I suppose

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.110 
hit some things I suppose
so<00:03:08.459> let's<00:03:08.670> actually<00:03:09.000> use<00:03:09.239> my<00:03:09.480> seed<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.200> um

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
so let's actually use my seed here um

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.550 
so let's actually use my seed here um
that's<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.299> normally<00:03:12.720> how<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.870> use<00:03:13.049> my<00:03:13.260> seed

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
that's that's normally how I use my seed

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.500 
that's that's normally how I use my seed
in<00:03:13.590> everyday<00:03:14.099> life<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.519> just<00:03:14.730> throw<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.209> bugs

probably<00:03:46.620> at<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.769> end<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.040> level<00:03:47.340> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
probably at the end of this level I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.039 
probably at the end of this level I
suppose<00:03:48.260> I'm<00:03:49.260> still<00:03:49.560> empty<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.100> ammo

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.110 
suppose I'm still empty on ammo
unfortunately<00:03:52.280> we'll<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:53.549> what<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.940> do

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
unfortunately we'll see what I can do

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.699 
unfortunately we'll see what I can do
with<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.420> though<00:03:54.799> it's<00:03:55.799> hard<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.280> judge

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
with that though it's hard to judge

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.640 
with that though it's hard to judge
melee<00:03:58.709> range<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.579> for<00:03:59.880> sure<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:01.560> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
melee range with this for sure but it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.610 
melee range with this for sure but it
seems<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.730> can<00:04:02.849> be<00:04:02.970> pretty<00:04:03.510> far<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.170> still<00:04:04.380> be

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
don't know if this makes nuclear throat

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.379 
don't know if this makes nuclear throat
a<00:04:12.720> little<00:04:12.870> bit<00:04:13.109> easier<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.620> manage<00:04:14.389> actually

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
a little bit easier to manage actually

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.620 
a little bit easier to manage actually
um<00:04:16.260> they<00:04:16.680> all<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.310> shots<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.000> are<00:04:18.120> being

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
um they all the shots that are being

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.560 
um they all the shots that are being
fired<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.109> may<00:04:19.229> seem<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.680> be<00:04:20.299> avoided<00:04:21.299> rather

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
fired that may seem to be avoided rather

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.450 
fired that may seem to be avoided rather
simply<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.140> am<00:04:22.560> out<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> bullets<00:04:23.159> and<00:04:23.220> I've<00:04:23.340> got

alright<00:04:26.330> well<00:04:26.480> let's<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:26.870> do<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.290> it's

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
alright well let's just do that it's

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.260 
alright well let's just do that it's
freezing<00:04:27.920> in<00:04:28.010> place<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.580> maybe<00:04:28.790> I'll<00:04:29.030> be<00:04:29.180> able

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
freezing in place and maybe I'll be able

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.270 
freezing in place and maybe I'll be able
to<00:04:29.450> bounce<00:04:30.050> some<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.380> these<00:04:30.440> shots<00:04:30.710> back<00:04:30.980> and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
to bounce some of these shots back and

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.780 
to bounce some of these shots back and
again<00:04:31.820> this<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.540> like<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.950> slower<00:04:33.950> motion

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
again this is in like a slower motion

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.310 
again this is in like a slower motion
game<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.850> don't<00:04:37.850> believe<00:04:38.060> everything<00:04:39.050> that

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
game so don't believe everything that

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.040 
game so don't believe everything that
you<00:04:39.380> see<00:04:39.560> let's<00:04:40.090> try<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.180> smash<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.690> guy<00:04:41.870> back

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
there and let's actually go see if I

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.380
