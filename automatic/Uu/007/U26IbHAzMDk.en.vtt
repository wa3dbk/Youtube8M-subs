 the testimony of the victims 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 but it is made from the

 testimony of the victimizers themselves 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.220

 after your fingerprints or 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.640
 descriptive features of the body and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.870
 Later they are thrown into the sea or 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 one of the other final destinations 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.159
 and then it came out 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.159
 the hotel and no no 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.310
 he's a guy who has a way of living 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.530

 for what he lived or maybe for some 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.180
 which he probably did by much 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.730
 what the human being saw is not done 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.170
 to torture neither to eliminate from 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.500
 this way not all of that has a 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.500
 cost
