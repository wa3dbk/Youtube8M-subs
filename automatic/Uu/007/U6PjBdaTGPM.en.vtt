00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 greetings and hammering for everyone here 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 so hammer and I bring you a mod that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.690
 They had asked for a long time 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 of ex is chest of experience and for the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 that does not know him , adds us to the world of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.320
 minecraft the chests in which 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.900
 save our levels so that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 when we die do not lose them as you see 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 add these two tables that are very 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.140
 similar to enchantment weighs with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.560
 a gold chest and is with a chest of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.750
 enders let's see how it pulls in 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.860
 the case of the first one is done with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.809
 obsidian gold ingots and a chest 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.719
 we would get this and in the case of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.230
 second with two cut diamonds 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.550
 obsidian and a wooden chest above 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.640
 you know the chest where it is made with 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 obsidian and the eye of ender and if not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.530
 you know the eye to sell is made with a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 pearl of ender and the flame dust that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.360
 is obtained from the flaming bars of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.390
 the flames in sneijder 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.970
 and we would get this from here when I 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 we click right we have two buttons 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.160
 here to withdraw the experience or to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.260
 save it we also have here a bar 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.050
 to select the percentage that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.440
 we want to withdraw or save I'm going to get 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.630
 the survival mode as you see I have 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.870
 here 33 levels this will give you something more than 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870
 experience 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.370
 35 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.950
 and when I give a right click if I 'm going to 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.680
 keep me keep and absolutely 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.590
 all 35 levels as you can see 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 save a lot if I give to withdraw 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.800
 with one hundred percent 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.380
 obviously I would remove all the 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.659
 experience 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.860
 if you choose a percentage for example a 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.039
 10% will save me 10% of the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.689
 total experience of these 35 levels and 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.460
 that is obviously taken into account by the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.649
 percentage that tells us are not of the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.050
 levels but of the total experience that 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.210
 we have 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.910
 we can go back to change again 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.550
 example 75 percent and we give it to 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.640
 and now would save 31 levels which 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.660
 I would have saved this works 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 Independent 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.660
 If we have here another table I 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.120
 for example here I'm going to give him to save 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.819
 20% 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.850
 and I have 14 levels here if I gave it to 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.800
 this as you see has nothing 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.170
 in the case of those who offer from 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.540
 experience will work exactly 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.450
 same as the originals for example 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.230
 I keep the 35 levels here 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.320
 if I open another chest here if I click 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.740
 right is the experience here 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.350
 shared 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.440
 and I can withdraw it if I withdraw one 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.250
 He removed it from everyone as you see the chests 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.660
 of experience selling share the same 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.180
 than the ones offered in there while 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.430
 these are independent I also os 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.270
 I would recommend that you combine eyes with 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.620
 another mode of which I already did a review and 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.240
 in fact I'm going to put the link in the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.940
 description and also here in the video 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.040
 that was the em chantin plus with the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.140
 chantin plus 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.049
 we can make the advanced table 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.329
 enchantment with which you can 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.540
 put enchantments without them 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.280
 randomize eliminate randomness and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.000
 makes the enchantment the one that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.510
 we want the table is done 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.720
 with four 2-2 gold ingots and bullseye 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.989
 the table of enchantment a book and 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.870
 feather the gray feather as you know is like 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.060
 a book a pen and a sack of ink and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.280
 an eye of ender perhaps he taught it before 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.099
 with a pearl of ender and the powder of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.349
 flames you get from those of the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.600
 laws of the rods I called before the 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.330
 calls 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.230
 then you can also manufacture this one 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.170
 tablet tablet a great with four 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.350
 gold ingots two obsidian the book and 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.430
 pen and the young man of the as you see is equal 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:08.200
 that this without the enchantment table 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.480
 this is because if we take 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.260
 or grade and we give you right click on 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.569
 a table 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.840
 As you can see it opens but if we press the 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.570
 shift as you know to apply it on 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.030
 she would change to a table 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.550
 advanced enchantment the table 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.000
 Advanced enchantment I already showed it to you 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.150
 in the previous review 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.740
 you can choose well some of the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.680
 pieces that you have equipped with armor 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.639
 and select the levels that you want from 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.639
 the piece any 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.580
 and also with the swords stops by 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.860
 sharpness example 3 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.620
 and here you would be happy with what 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.900
 which would eliminate randomness and or 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.629
 I recommend it, I tell you 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.409
 that in the other review is explained 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:03.469
 much more conscientiously but the truth is 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:06.590
 that it would be convenient to combine the ex chest with 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:09.110
 with the chantin plus we are here in my 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.599
 channel as always I recommend the 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.659
 Optimal comfort tutorials with mods 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.979
 both premium and non-premium you know 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.530
 that there are also the folders 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.139
 installation in the description are the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.909
 links for the download you put it in the 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.159
 corresponding route and you will not have 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.500
 no problem anyway I'm going to 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.540
 teach the installation from scratch 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.340
 like I have the test here 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.440
 the download links will advance in the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.900
 description and in the case of in sant 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.450
 they will even be in the review that 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.150
 I already did previously the first thing would be 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.600
 go here to percentage dating 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.700
 percentage 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.190
 and changing the name is the folder for 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.500
 do not lose it and to do the installation 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.350
 right from the start 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.130
 the first thing would be to run the launcher e 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.130
 install minecraft 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.659
 Once installed, we run it 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.780
 and then we close it 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.200
 now we decompress the force 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.130
 we give you right click to open with java 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.050
 platform we select the route you already know 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.150
 I have this if you have the users 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.980
 the user names minecraft 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.190
 would change in this button we give to 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.670
 accept and we install it we go back another 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.360
 run the launcher 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.530
 we run minecraft again 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.530
 we select the profile de force 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.350
 and we open minecraft again 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.560
 to then close it 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.620
 now we copy this 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.790
 and we put here percentage here dating 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.470
 percentage 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.580
 or the route that you have 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.190
 corresponding and here we have copied 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.750
 you exist 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.750
 we run once more 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.460
 we give the button play 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.150
 and as you see here in mode would be the former 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.150
 chest 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.270
 As I said, I recommend you in 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.270
 chantin plus 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.900
 they have the links here in the description 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.670
 and others and nothing has been all this if 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.390
 has liked to give the x subscribe and 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.390
 share it
