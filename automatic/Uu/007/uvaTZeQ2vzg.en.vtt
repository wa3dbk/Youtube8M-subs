Harvard<00:00:14.549> professor<00:00:15.210> Henry<00:00:15.240> Louis<00:00:16.049> Gates<00:00:16.199> was

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the president right to comment on the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.750 
the president right to comment on the
incident<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.260> don't<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.550> wasn't

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
incident I don't think so there wasn't

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.700 
incident I don't think so there wasn't
enough<00:00:21.240> information<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.320> president<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
enough information for the president to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.349 
enough information for the president to
really<00:00:23.039> know<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.460> did<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:23.939> take<00:00:24.330> place

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
really know what did actually take place

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.210 
really know what did actually take place
so<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> think<00:00:25.019> he<00:00:25.289> should<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.619> deferred<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so I think he should have deferred and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.740 
so I think he should have deferred and
waited<00:00:26.519> until<00:00:26.580> more<00:00:26.910> information<00:00:27.420> came<00:00:27.539> out

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
waited until more information came out

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.929 
waited until more information came out
about<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.170> event<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.609> cracked

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
about the event I think it was cracked

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
about the event I think it was cracked
for<00:00:30.150> him<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> comment<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> been<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
for him to comment on it if it's been a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.889 
for him to comment on it if it's been a
hot<00:00:31.830> topic<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.399> news<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.540> think<00:00:33.780> people

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
hot topic in the news and I think people

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
hot topic in the news and I think people
are<00:00:34.140> kind<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> making<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.980> bigger<00:00:35.160> deal<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
are kind of making a bigger deal out of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.799 
are kind of making a bigger deal out of
it<00:00:35.700> because<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.329> african-american

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it because it was an african-american

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.860 
it because it was an african-american
professor<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.920> mean<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.760> feel<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.690> police

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
professor I mean I feel if the police

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.030 
professor I mean I feel if the police
would<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.140> arrested<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.530> white<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.829> he

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
would have arrested a white one he

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
would have arrested a white one he
probably<00:00:41.280> would<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.640> said<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> same<00:00:42.000> thing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
probably would have said the same thing

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
probably would have said the same thing
too<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> would<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.290> happened<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.920> think

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
too if that would have happened I think

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
too if that would have happened I think
that<00:00:44.550> any<00:00:44.670> citizen<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> right<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> comment

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that any citizen has a right to comment

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
that any citizen has a right to comment
on<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> news<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.940> clear<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
on the news it's not clear to me the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
on the news it's not clear to me the
President<00:00:48.960> Obama<00:00:49.200> had<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.829> information

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
President Obama had any information

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
President Obama had any information
other<00:00:50.910> than<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.620> president

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
other than what we have and as president

other than what we have and as president
united<00:00:53.250> states<00:00:53.640> i<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:54.000> he<00:00:54.090> should<00:00:54.239> have

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
united states i think he should have

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
united states i think he should have
been<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.690> prudent<00:00:55.230> before<00:00:56.129> going

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
been a little more prudent before going

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
been a little more prudent before going
on<00:00:56.579> national<00:00:57.120> television<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.840> accusing<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
on national television and accusing the
police<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> doing<00:00:58.949> something<00:00:59.160> wrong<00:00:59.460> do<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
police of doing something wrong do you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760 
police of doing something wrong do you
think<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> Cambridge<00:01:00.899> police<00:01:01.230> acted

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
think the Cambridge police acted

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
think the Cambridge police acted
honestly<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.670> case<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> abided<00:01:03.629> by<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
honestly in this case and abided by the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.940 
honestly in this case and abided by the
law<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.640> didn't<00:01:05.640> quite<00:01:05.820> catch<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.420> case

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
law I didn't quite catch the case

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.120 
law I didn't quite catch the case
totally<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> exactly<00:01:08.790> how<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.260> went<00:01:10.260> bad<00:01:10.439> but

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
totally of exactly how they went bad but

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
totally of exactly how they went bad but
from<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.340> i<00:01:11.400> heard<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:12.270> didn't<00:01:12.689> sound<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
from what i heard they didn't sound it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
from what i heard they didn't sound it
was<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.260> professional<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.100> i<00:01:14.460> think

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
was too professional about it i think

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
was too professional about it i think
that<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.479> did<00:01:15.689> abide<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> law<00:01:16.500> because

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that they did abide by the law because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
that they did abide by the law because
the<00:01:16.920> man<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.970> looked<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> breaking

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the man was it looked like a breaking

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
the man was it looked like a breaking
breaking<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.820> face<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> doesn't

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
breaking in on the face of it it doesn't

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
breaking in on the face of it it doesn't
look<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.229> situation<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.220> think

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
look like a good situation and i think

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
look like a good situation and i think
it<00:01:23.520> needs<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.880> further<00:01:24.030> investigated<00:01:24.439> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it needs to be further investigated you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
it needs to be further investigated you
know<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> tell<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> tend<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> believe

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
know I got to tell you I tend to believe

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.219 
know I got to tell you I tend to believe
the<00:01:27.210> police<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.840> they<00:01:27.930> would<00:01:28.110> have

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the police I think they would have

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
the police I think they would have
apologized<00:01:28.829> quickly<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.360> they

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
apologized quickly if they if they

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.789 
apologized quickly if they if they
really<00:01:30.900> felt<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.470> was<00:01:31.500> something

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really felt that there was something

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.550 
really felt that there was something
wrong<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> police

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
wrong there I don't think the police

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
wrong there I don't think the police
union<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.040> supporting<00:01:35.700> their<00:01:36.060> officer

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
union would be supporting their officer

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.230 
union would be supporting their officer
if<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> wasn't<00:01:37.560> true<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> believe

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
if it if it wasn't true do you believe

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
if it if it wasn't true do you believe
police<00:01:39.780> treat<00:01:40.140> minorities<00:01:40.890> such<00:01:41.340> as

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
police treat minorities such as

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.609

african-americans and Hispanics with
