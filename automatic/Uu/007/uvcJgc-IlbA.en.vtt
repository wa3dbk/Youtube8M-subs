00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello friends, how are you 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 this between professionals and dedicated 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 those working with joinery with 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
 the installation of a bank equal to this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.859
 we will show that it is possible to apply 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 different tools to facilitate 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.220
 your day to day 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.820
 in the first place we will use the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.130
 measuring and marking equipment for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.779
 prepare the wood after we leave 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.790
 for cutting using different 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 saws and drills error 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 in this case we can use the saw 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.020
 circle the glass saw to the tico-tico 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.879
 the saw and also the drill three points 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 first we will use the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.590
 train professional irving of five 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.719
 meters and a graceful carpenter's pencil 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.360
 quality material used 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 this tape which has clear measures 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.460
 and offers maximum accuracy 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.039
 you can find the points you want 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.080
 quickly the tape hook allows you to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 use own wood as support 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.150
 synonymous with service agility 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.070
 now let's fix the wood to the workbench 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 with the help of sister's quick clip 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.720
 for the next step I will apply a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.810
 metal cup saw equipped with 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.450
 easy and secure locking that facilitates 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 your mounting bracket ideal for 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.320
 different sports materials such as 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 woods and metals 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.200
 this saw has depth of cut of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.380
 38mm long durability and high 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.210
 resistance 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 with the help of that good rule to check 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.729
 your holes are the way I 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 would 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 in addition to once again use the pencil 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.590
 carpenter to make the markings for 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.590
 the next step 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.230
 still with the hose attached applies to the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.210
 tico-tico whose geometry of the 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.830
 teeth is designed to ensure a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.650
 excellent performance 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.890
 the spinning of the tico-tico irb saw is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.950
 high quality which provides cuts 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.670
 quick and great finishing even in 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.670
 delicate pieces 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.420
 Good now that we have all the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.520
 ready parts 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.680
 it's time to make the fittings that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.990
 precedes the fixation of the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.880
 For this I will distribute the pieces on 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.920
 the bench and with the help of a template 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.850
 I'll check for the alignment. 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.850
 required 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.060
 now everything is in place once more 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.430
 I'll use the clamp that will serve as 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.340
 support to maintain the French structure 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.010
 while applying the exchange for irb wood 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.560
 in this case the mouse clip dispenses the use 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.720
 and allows the drill bit to make its 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.720
 work quickly and practically 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.860
 after all the holes made is arrived 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.960
 the time to use the tips for 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.390
 screwdrivers to give a loss 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.680
 which is then complemented by the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.020
 screwdriver 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.780
 these two tools work well 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.130
 together only a short time ago 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.980
 to make a durable and well-finished piece 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.950
 As you may have noticed we use 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.080
 a number of tools for this search 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.170
 always leave them organized with the help 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.530
 of a suitcase like espa a mala tom tom center 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.530
 comes and goes 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.500
