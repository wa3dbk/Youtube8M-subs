indeed<00:04:48.439> I<00:04:48.740> think<00:04:49.569> maybe<00:04:50.569> I'm<00:04:51.169> not<00:04:51.649> sure<00:04:51.979> but<00:04:52.729> I

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
indeed I think maybe I'm not sure but I

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.299 
indeed I think maybe I'm not sure but I
look<00:04:53.210> down<00:04:53.449> at<00:04:53.719> the<00:04:53.839> speedo<00:04:54.379> when<00:04:54.949> i'm<00:04:55.099> racing

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:55.309 
look down at the speedo when i'm racing

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.779 
look down at the speedo when i'm racing
him<00:04:55.819> and<00:04:56.149> it<00:04:57.020> went<00:04:57.289> past<00:04:57.529> what<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.069> speedo<00:04:58.369> can

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
him and it went past what the speedo can

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.499 
him and it went past what the speedo can
do<00:04:58.999> and<00:04:59.360> he'd<00:04:59.809> gone<00:04:59.990> around<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.469> second<00:05:00.979> time

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
do and he'd gone around the second time

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.600 
do and he'd gone around the second time
then<00:05:02.509> I<00:05:02.779> don't<00:05:03.229> know<00:05:03.409> maybe<00:05:03.740> I'm<00:05:04.279> imagining

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
then I don't know maybe I'm imagining

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.899 
then I don't know maybe I'm imagining
but<00:05:05.270> I'm<00:05:05.479> greedy<00:05:06.110> shoulder<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.399> was<00:05:07.669> maybe

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
but I'm greedy shoulder it was maybe

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.359 
but I'm greedy shoulder it was maybe
going<00:05:08.330> 300<00:05:09.639> maybe<00:05:11.649> his<00:05:12.649> hearings<00:05:13.009> been<00:05:13.159> going
