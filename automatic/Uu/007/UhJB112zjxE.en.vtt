00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.580
 my world my new one today 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 I'm going to minecraft now 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:19.609
 have lots of players from microsoft in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.010
 I will also video next 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.130
 my house upstairs downstairs 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.829
 that would not necessarily pull now 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 because it is not the main point here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.940
 I have it in the last video 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 I promised you this 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 Experience and animal coloring can show 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.690
 we made it ok we fly for it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 now because that's too long for me now 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.109
 Take the train with the train 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.539
 It takes another ten years to say it 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.629
 fly nice find she has on the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.629
 It is nicely built 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:17.549
 I soon got her I got it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.670
 especially when wheat have to say 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 get rid of them 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.360
 Okay, I'll show you how 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.670
 You trick the zoo on this 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.460
 one manages to also carry this creates 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.549
 and this and this still 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.799
 I had to beat something 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.189
 Actually that is in the now out 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.810
 come 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.229
 actually that would have to be so 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.790
 so now here eg here is that some 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.790
 Visible others have all the time 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.829
 Hello 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 the sheep is not me 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.350
 must once briefly taken quite difficult 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.350
 sad story of the sword and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.920
 I really thought that as 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.899
 girl 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.319
 Deep down this is not wanting the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.030
 I just do not look any further 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.970

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.489
 heike are not good tips i am one 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.500
 Girls have batteries so very great 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:33.610
 yes I just shooting times from 1 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.610
 which I now record here 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.019
 but I'm really sorry what happened 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.900
 So, as I said, please do not 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.250
 Just follow all the tips I give 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.940
 they could never do that either 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.760
 fold 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.530
 ok you have seen now you can yes 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.430
 not only do we manage that somehow 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.519
 illogical 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.370
 I write below in the link which animals 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.160
 to pass with us and which to dye 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.530
 So I can assure you that 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.670
 the only tip you please follow 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.390
 you should not be able to duck any cows 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.530
 or whatever its when, who or what 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.180
 always and do not stain 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.739

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.720
