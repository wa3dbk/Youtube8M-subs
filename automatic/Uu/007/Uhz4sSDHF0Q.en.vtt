00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
but 18 paintings I've been working about

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.310 
but 18 paintings I've been working about
five<00:00:48.579> months<00:00:48.760> on<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:49.780> they're<00:00:49.899> all<00:00:49.989> acrylic

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
five months on and they're all acrylic

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.579 
five months on and they're all acrylic
on<00:00:50.620> panel<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:51.699> one<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:52.030> called<00:00:52.149> dog<00:00:52.420> park<00:00:52.780> and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
on panel this one is called dog park and

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.470 
on panel this one is called dog park and
I<00:00:53.739> was<00:00:53.859> kind<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.100> inspired<00:00:54.460> by<00:00:54.609> this<00:00:54.670> some<00:00:55.359> of

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
I was kind of inspired by this some of

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.790 
I was kind of inspired by this some of
my<00:00:55.600> subject<00:00:56.199> matter<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.530> deals<00:00:56.710> with

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
my subject matter it deals with

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.430 
my subject matter it deals with
dystopian<00:00:57.399> themes<00:00:57.730> or<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.870> one<00:01:02.050> actually<00:01:02.230> is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
dystopian themes or this one actually is

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.860 
dystopian themes or this one actually is
when<00:01:02.769> I<00:01:03.190> was<00:01:03.850> thinking<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.269> something<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:04.780> the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
when I was thinking of something in the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.980 
when I was thinking of something in the
future<00:01:05.050> basically<00:01:06.040> it's<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.630> memorial

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
future basically it's it's a memorial

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.180 
future basically it's it's a memorial
for<00:01:08.620> war<00:01:09.040> dogs<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.180> war<00:01:10.330> dogs<00:01:10.540> were<00:01:10.750> used

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
for war dogs and the war dogs were used

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.580 
for war dogs and the war dogs were used
they<00:01:12.190> were<00:01:12.280> trained<00:01:12.520> actually<00:01:12.909> for<00:01:13.810> one<00:01:14.050> and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
they were trained actually for one and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.190 
they were trained actually for one and
they<00:01:15.250> would<00:01:15.370> strap<00:01:15.720> explosives<00:01:16.720> on<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> dog's

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
they would strap explosives on the dog's

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.899 
they would strap explosives on the dog's
back<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:18.130> then<00:01:18.250> there<00:01:18.370> between<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.729> hide

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
back and then there between the hide

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.550 
back and then there between the hide
actually<00:01:19.270> under<00:01:19.479> tanks<00:01:19.719> and<00:01:20.259> there<00:01:20.380> would<00:01:20.530> be

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
actually under tanks and there would be

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.560 
actually under tanks and there would be
detonated<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.610> was<00:01:21.729> just<00:01:21.909> so<00:01:22.060> shocked<00:01:22.360> by

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
detonated and I was just so shocked by

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.130 
detonated and I was just so shocked by
this<00:01:23.040> thing<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.219> poor<00:01:24.430> dogs

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this thing of the poor dogs

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.179 
this thing of the poor dogs
and<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.450> thought<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.689> dog<00:01:28.869> looks<00:01:29.079> so<00:01:29.229> alert<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
and I thought the dog looks so alert and

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.440 
and I thought the dog looks so alert and
so<00:01:30.430> almost<00:01:31.299> an<00:01:31.539> attack<00:01:31.840> some<00:01:32.799> extent<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.579> was

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
so almost an attack some extent I was

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.959 
so almost an attack some extent I was
thinking<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.020> possibly<00:01:35.439> 50<00:01:35.890> 75<00:01:36.369> or<00:01:36.850> 100

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
thinking you know possibly 50 75 or 100

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.539 
thinking you know possibly 50 75 or 100
years<00:01:37.299> from<00:01:37.509> now<00:01:38.159> maybe<00:01:39.159> what<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
years from now maybe what the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.219 
years from now maybe what the
environment<00:01:40.000> might<00:01:40.299> look<00:01:40.479> like<00:01:40.750> without

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
environment might look like without

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.020 
environment might look like without
humans<00:01:41.740> anymore<00:01:41.979> exposing<00:01:42.850> something

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
humans anymore exposing something

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.730 
humans anymore exposing something
happened<00:01:43.509> some<00:01:43.719> ecological<00:01:44.530> my

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
happened some ecological my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.800 
happened some ecological my
golde<00:01:46.070> something<00:01:46.640> happens<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.390> we're<00:01:47.689> no

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
golde something happens and we're no

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.480 
golde something happens and we're no
longer<00:01:47.960> there<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:48.979> only<00:01:49.130> record

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
longer there and so the only record

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.569 
longer there and so the only record
that's<00:01:49.670> left<00:01:49.939> are<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.960> monuments<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:52.310> trash

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
that's left are the monuments the trash

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.810 
that's left are the monuments the trash
the<00:01:52.909> debris<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:54.380> all<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.070> basically<00:01:55.280> just

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
the debris and all and basically just

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.210 
the debris and all and basically just
nature<00:01:56.180> sort<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.570> reclaiming<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
nature sort of reclaiming the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.620 
nature sort of reclaiming the
environment<00:01:58.700> again<00:02:01.180> this<00:02:02.180> body<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.509> work

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
environment again this body of work

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.740 
environment again this body of work
started<00:02:03.140> out<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.500> was<00:02:03.830> thinking<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.750> actually

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
started out I was thinking of actually

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.440 
started out I was thinking of actually
from<00:02:06.080> an<00:02:06.170> article<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.530> read<00:02:06.939> about<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.239> polar

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
from an article I read about the polar

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.440 
from an article I read about the polar
ice<00:02:08.660> receding<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:10.399> melting<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.090> it's

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
ice receding and melting and that it's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.020 
ice receding and melting and that it's
threatening<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.950> habitat<00:02:13.400> hunting<00:02:13.610> ground

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
threatening the habitat hunting ground

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.300 
threatening the habitat hunting ground
of<00:02:14.180> polar<00:02:14.420> bears<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.739> many<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.160> polar

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
of polar bears and many of the polar

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.670 
of polar bears and many of the polar
bears<00:02:16.580> they<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.630> swim<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.230> forage<00:02:18.530> for

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
bears they have to swim and forage for

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.220 
bears they have to swim and forage for
food<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.760> because<00:02:19.970> there's<00:02:20.120> no<00:02:20.269> ice<00:02:20.450> they're

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
food and because there's no ice they're

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
food and because there's no ice they're
swimming<00:02:21.440> such<00:02:21.860> long<00:02:22.069> distances<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:22.790> often

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
swimming such long distances they often

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.130 
swimming such long distances they often
drowned<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.610> idea<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:27.080> just

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
drowned and the idea of that it just

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.080 
drowned and the idea of that it just
really<00:02:27.470> hit<00:02:27.650> me<00:02:27.769> hard<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.220> instantly<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.940> had<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
really hit me hard and instantly I had a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.580 
really hit me hard and instantly I had a
visual<00:02:29.420> image<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.799> ground<00:02:31.100> polar<00:02:31.370> bears

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
visual image of these ground polar bears

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.420 
visual image of these ground polar bears
playing<00:02:33.590> with<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> little<00:02:34.280> bit<00:02:34.370> of

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
playing with a little bit of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.920 
playing with a little bit of
storytelling<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.700> decided<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.360> have

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
storytelling and and decided to have

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.530 
storytelling and and decided to have
them<00:02:39.140> sleeping<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.760> they're<00:02:41.060> not<00:02:41.209> exactly

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
them sleeping so they're not exactly

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.089 
them sleeping so they're not exactly
dead<00:02:42.459> they're<00:02:43.459> sort<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.700> suspended<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.799> sort

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
dead they're sort of suspended and sort

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.930 
dead they're sort of suspended and sort
of<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.250> hibernation<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:48.319> these<00:02:49.010> also<00:02:49.250> started

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
of in hibernation and these also started

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.030 
of in hibernation and these also started
for<00:02:50.150> me<00:02:50.410> they're<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> bit<00:02:51.650> card<00:02:51.890> for<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
for me they're a bit card for the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.860 
for me they're a bit card for the
cathartic<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.609> make<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.030> had<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.359> friend<00:02:53.630> who

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
cathartic to make I had a friend who

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.190 
cathartic to make I had a friend who
passed<00:02:54.049> away<00:02:54.440> about<00:02:54.590> three<00:02:54.739> months<00:02:55.190> ago<00:02:56.200> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
passed away about three months ago and
