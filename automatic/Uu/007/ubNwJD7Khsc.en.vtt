now I don't need that so this is what I
got<00:02:32.630> I'm<00:02:33.080> going<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.380> end<00:02:33.500> up<00:02:33.650> thread<00:02:34.070> my<00:02:34.280> own

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
got I'm going to end up thread my own

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.140 
got I'm going to end up thread my own
anyway<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.880> have<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> stock<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.050> dice<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:37.340> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
anyway I have a stock and dice but it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.820 
anyway I have a stock and dice but it
costs<00:02:38.600> me<00:02:38.720> nope<00:02:38.900> no<00:02:39.140> charge<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
costs me nope no charge for the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.220 
costs me nope no charge for the
threading<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:42.140> therefore<00:02:43.150> if<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.390> divide<00:02:44.780> 4

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
threading so therefore if I divide 4

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.620 
threading so therefore if I divide 4
into<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.940> 13<00:02:47.390> bucks<00:02:47.710> for<00:02:48.710> 4<00:02:48.950> 3<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.370> 12<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
into the 13 bucks for 4 3 is 12 so and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.910 
into the 13 bucks for 4 3 is 12 so and
then<00:02:50.840> 1/4<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.400> know<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:53.330> talking<00:02:53.900> like<00:02:54.260> $3
