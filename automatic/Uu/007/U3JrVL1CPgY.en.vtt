 including the best wells 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.670
 must be eliminated according to 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.449
 existing accounting methods

 this pipe 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.190
 about 100,000 meters spill over a year 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.710
 cubic water 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.900

 perennial artesian water handle 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.450

 experts have already concluded to eliminate 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.549

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.250
 local authorities insist until the end of the year 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.810
