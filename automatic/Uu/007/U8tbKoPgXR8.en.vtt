impacts is going to become harder
together<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.829> EA<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.280> rise

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

that<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.910> knock<00:00:57.090> their<00:00:57.270> price<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.320> so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that will knock their price up just so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
that will knock their price up just so
more<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.739> less<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> market<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.719> more<00:01:00.719> self

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
more or less on the market and more self

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
more or less on the market and more self
