and you had to do that then say we've

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
and you had to do that then say we've
got<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> room<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> 12<00:00:46.649> people<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> room<00:00:47.309> as

got a room of 12 people in the room as

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
got a room of 12 people in the room as
an<00:00:48.090> administrator<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.840> trust<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.530> 12

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
an administrator would you trust all 12

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.529 
an administrator would you trust all 12
of<00:00:49.950> those<00:00:50.070> people<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> go<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> update<00:00:51.300> site

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
of those people to go to the update site

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.410 
of those people to go to the update site
and<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.440> every<00:00:52.800> day<00:00:52.850> no<00:00:53.850> that'd<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.300> very

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and do that every day no that'd be very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
and do that every day no that'd be very
inefficient<00:00:55.410> totally<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.100> inefficient<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
inefficient totally very inefficient and

downloading all these information and to
be<00:01:11.700> honest<00:01:12.000> even<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.689> i<00:01:12.810> did<00:01:12.869> trust<00:01:13.470> them<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:14.130> i

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
be honest even if i did trust them do i

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
be honest even if i did trust them do i
really<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.619> would<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> be

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
really want them to do it would it be

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
really want them to do it would it be
better<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.220> were<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.520> control<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.210> i

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
better if i were in control of it and i

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.719 
better if i were in control of it and i
could<00:01:19.229> force<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> updates

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
could force them to have the updates

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.480 
could force them to have the updates
that<00:01:20.970> i<00:01:21.119> wanted<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.340> after<00:01:23.340> i've

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that i wanted them to have after i've

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.800 
that i wanted them to have after i've
tested<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.509> sure<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:24.780> don't

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
tested them to make sure they don't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
tested them to make sure they don't
cause<00:01:25.140> any<00:01:25.290> adverse<00:01:25.470> effects<00:01:26.030> make<00:01:27.030> sense

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
cause any adverse effects make sense

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
cause any adverse effects make sense

special type of component that microsoft

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.940 
special type of component that microsoft
supply<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.320> called<00:02:04.439> software

update<00:02:05.310> services<00:02:05.820> obviously<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
update services obviously that's the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.050 
update services obviously that's the
topic<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:06.990> particular<00:02:07.259> section<00:02:08.160> the

topic of this particular section the
ways<00:02:09.209> software<00:02:09.690> update<00:02:09.989> services<00:02:10.470> works<00:02:10.739> its

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
ways software update services works its

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.880 
ways software update services works its
effectively<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.510> provides<00:02:12.989> an<00:02:13.379> altar

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
effectively it provides an altar

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.640 
effectively it provides an altar

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
updates from if you imagine you've got

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.510 
updates from if you imagine you've got
your<00:02:18.600> client<00:02:18.959> machine<00:02:19.260> down<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:22.370> where<00:02:23.370> does

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
your client machine down here where does

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.400 
your client machine down here where does
the<00:02:23.610> client<00:02:23.790> machine<00:02:24.180> go<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:25.110> example

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the client machine go to in your example

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.190 
the client machine go to in your example
Chris<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:26.490> would<00:02:26.610> go<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.240> proxy<00:02:27.630> server<00:02:27.660> or

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
Chris it would go to the proxy server or

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.380 
Chris it would go to the proxy server or
some<00:02:28.440> Isis<00:02:28.770> service<00:02:29.130> actually<00:02:29.490> connecting<00:02:29.850> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
some Isis service actually connecting to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.790 
some Isis service actually connecting to
the<00:02:30.510> internet<00:02:30.540> ok<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.320> through<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the internet ok so go through to the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.260 
the internet ok so go through to the
internet<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.459> accesses<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.880> microsoft

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
internet and it accesses a microsoft

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.600 
internet and it accesses a microsoft
website<00:02:33.420> yes<00:02:33.959> cool<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.190> imagine<00:02:35.250> here

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
website yes cool so if you imagine here

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.510 
website yes cool so if you imagine here
you've<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> internet<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:41.040> there<00:02:41.340> is

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
you've got the internet and on there is

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.220 
you've got the internet and on there is
the<00:02:41.610> Microsoft<00:02:41.970> website<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.660> obviously<00:02:43.050> what

do<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.329> think<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> software<00:03:18.870> update

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
do you think the software update

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.800 
do you think the software update
services<00:03:19.560> server<00:03:19.769> get<00:03:20.040> its<00:03:20.340> updates<00:03:20.850> then<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
services server get its updates then it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.410 
services server get its updates then it
goes<00:03:22.049> some<00:03:22.230> matters<00:03:22.410> precisely<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.790> goes<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
goes some matters precisely it goes to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.520 
goes some matters precisely it goes to
the<00:03:24.480> internet<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.799> gets<00:03:26.040> them<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:28.350> as<00:03:28.500> a

have to do you have to do
two<00:04:27.750> things<00:04:28.020> first<00:04:28.140> off<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.650> have<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.830> set<00:04:29.100> up

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
two things first off you have to set up

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.340 
two things first off you have to set up
the<00:04:29.310> server<00:04:29.550> component<00:04:30.200> secondly<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.320> have

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
the server component secondly you have

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.900 
the server component secondly you have
to<00:04:31.620> set<00:04:31.800> up<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:31.980> client<00:04:32.370> component<00:04:32.640> to

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
to set up the client component to

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.520 
to set up the client component to
instead<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.210> point<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.930> internet<00:04:34.320> it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
instead of point to the internet it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.800 
instead of point to the internet it
points<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.920> your<00:04:35.040> son<00:04:35.220> server<00:04:35.490> he<00:04:36.270> says<00:04:36.630> to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
points to your son server he says to

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.030 
points to your son server he says to
actions<00:04:37.170> you've<00:04:37.260> actually<00:04:37.410> got<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.710> perform

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
actions you've actually got to perform

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.160 
actions you've actually got to perform
now<00:04:38.670> what<00:04:38.940> will<00:04:39.090> happen<00:04:39.480> is<00:04:39.600> though<00:04:39.780> windows

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170
