00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.680
 grams of powdered sugar and a teaspoon 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.199

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.410
 today such a blue bluish color 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.360
 and for starters in the water bath I will put 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.420
 melt the chewing marshmallow to it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.039
 I'll add 10 grams of butter 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.719
 lemon juice here marshmallow me 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.730
 melted did not become creamy 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.930
 Now here I will add a little 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 sugar 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.239
 and mix everything thoroughly until she 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.130
 stop sticking to your hands 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.549
 continue to knead hands here mastic 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.110
 thickened now I shifted to 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.970
 plate below my powdered sugar 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 so that mastic does not stick to the plate 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710
 I will sprinkle you on top and already 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.869
 knead with hands until it stops 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.770
 completely sticks and will become so already 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.720
 it seems that you can roll it 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.549
 Here mastic has become such a consistency 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
 I need and she already does not stick at all 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.259
 to my hands and now i have to add 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.600

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.320
 looking for a dye will add like this 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.320
 a toothpick that is more or less evenly 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 to distribute 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.750
 Well, the mastic is completely ready. 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.119

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.800
