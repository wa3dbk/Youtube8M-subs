maybe<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.680> talk<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.160> bit<00:00:41.309> about<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
maybe to to talk a little bit about the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.090 
maybe to to talk a little bit about the
reasonings<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:43.739> different

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
reasonings for these different

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
reasonings for these different
variations<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.540> think<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.050> lot<00:00:46.199> of<00:00:46.230> times<00:00:46.440> it's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
variations I think a lot of times it's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
variations I think a lot of times it's
going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> depend<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.570> guy's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
going to depend on this this guy's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.810 
going to depend on this this guy's
reaction<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> fight<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.460> trying<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
reaction in a fight it you're trying to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
reaction in a fight it you're trying to
develop<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.360> ability<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:52.020> seamlessly<00:00:52.410> flow

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
develop the ability to seamlessly flow

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.549 
develop the ability to seamlessly flow
into<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.790> right<00:00:53.940> tool<00:00:54.230> sometimes<00:00:55.230> he's<00:00:55.379> going

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
into the right tool sometimes he's going

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
into the right tool sometimes he's going
to<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> little<00:00:55.950> bit<00:00:56.100> closer<00:00:56.280> that's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to be a little bit closer that's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.190 
to be a little bit closer that's
probably<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.510> what<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> going

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
theory on the mp3 rounds you can use any

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.510 
theory on the mp3 rounds you can use any
of<00:02:49.660> those<00:02:50.040> combinations<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.160> you'd<00:02:51.370> like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
of those combinations that you'd like

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.650 
of those combinations that you'd like
you<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.910> can<00:02:52.060> cycle<00:02:52.270> through<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
you but you can cycle through the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.009 
you but you can cycle through the
various<00:02:52.900> ones<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.880> me<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.209> stick<00:02:55.510> with<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> basic

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
various ones for me I stick with a basic

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.270 
various ones for me I stick with a basic
one<00:02:56.170> left<00:02:56.410> kick<00:02:56.620> right<00:02:56.650> cross<00:02:57.010> left<00:02:57.040> hook

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
one left kick right cross left hook

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.490 
one left kick right cross left hook
right<00:02:57.400> okay<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.340> they<00:03:00.489> don't<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:02.459> yes<00:03:04.500> so

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
right okay so they don't have yes so

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.990 
right okay so they don't have yes so
when<00:03:05.860> they're<00:03:05.980> shadowboxing<00:03:06.820> these

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
when they're shadowboxing these

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.449 
when they're shadowboxing these
techniques<00:03:07.480> there<00:03:08.440> are<00:03:08.560> two<00:03:08.800> ways<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.130> can

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
techniques there are two ways you can

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.630 
techniques there are two ways you can
throw<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> Thai<00:03:10.120> kick<00:03:11.100> when<00:03:12.100> you're<00:03:12.250> going<00:03:12.550> to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
throw the Thai kick when you're going to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.310 
throw the Thai kick when you're going to
when<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.880> finish<00:03:13.300> your<00:03:13.420> phrase<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.019> want<00:03:14.170> to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
when you finish your phrase you want to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.509 
when you finish your phrase you want to
commit<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.709> kick<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.070> go<00:03:15.220> all<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.489> way

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
commit to that kick and go all the way

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.240 
commit to that kick and go all the way
around<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.110> if<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.560> might<00:03:17.739> hear<00:03:17.950> him<00:03:18.040> say<00:03:18.220> a

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
around so if you might hear him say a

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.400 
around so if you might hear him say a
right<00:03:18.459> kick<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:19.180> by<00:03:19.360> itself<00:03:19.690> then<00:03:20.260> that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
right kick just by itself then that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.199 
right kick just by itself then that
might<00:03:20.830> look<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.400> stepped<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.760> my<00:03:21.850> 45

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
might look like this I stepped on my 45

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.229 
might look like this I stepped on my 45
degree<00:03:22.540> angle<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:24.160> throw<00:03:24.370> my<00:03:24.519> kid<00:03:24.730> come<00:03:25.060> back

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
degree angle and throw my kid come back

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.140 
degree angle and throw my kid come back
down<00:03:25.480> get<00:03:26.170> back<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.500> my<00:03:26.680> stance<00:03:26.950> whole<00:03:27.700> idea<00:03:28.090> of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
down get back to my stance whole idea of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.229 
down get back to my stance whole idea of
going<00:03:28.329> all<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.600> way<00:03:28.630> around<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:29.220> committing

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
going all the way around is committing

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.900 
going all the way around is committing
100%<00:03:31.239> toward<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:32.070> delivering<00:03:33.070> your<00:03:33.190> power<00:03:33.400> to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
100% toward the delivering your power to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.160 
100% toward the delivering your power to
the<00:03:34.030> target<00:03:35.549> just<00:03:36.549> like<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.390> they<00:03:38.110> are

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
the target just like that here they are

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.870 
the target just like that here they are
working<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.890> little<00:03:39.010> bit<00:03:39.220> higher<00:03:41.280> Shh<00:03:43.709> okay<00:03:44.880> but

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
working a little bit higher Shh okay but

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.520 
working a little bit higher Shh okay but
when<00:03:46.209> you're<00:03:46.360> putting<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:47.019> kicks<00:03:47.350> in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
when you're putting the kicks in

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.009 
when you're putting the kicks in
combination<00:03:48.370> it's<00:03:49.209> hard<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.600> go<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.959> way

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
combination it's hard to go all the way

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.590 
combination it's hard to go all the way
around<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:50.680> reset<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.700> follow<00:03:52.239> up<00:03:52.450> so

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
around and then reset and follow up so

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.539 
around and then reset and follow up so
say<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.230> tie<00:03:53.410> four<00:03:53.680> count<00:03:53.920> basic<00:03:54.220> type<00:03:54.370> four

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
say the tie four count basic type four

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.090 
say the tie four count basic type four
count<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.720> shadowboxing<00:03:56.110> mode<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.980> other

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
count and shadowboxing mode the other

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.130 
count and shadowboxing mode the other
way<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.310> throw<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.610> kick<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.269> what<00:03:58.900> we<00:03:58.989> do

quick<00:04:36.830> another<00:04:37.310> thing<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.640> sometimes<00:04:37.820> you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
quick another thing is sometimes you

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.210 
quick another thing is sometimes you
might<00:04:38.180> kick<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.480> can<00:04:38.660> here<00:04:38.900> that's<00:04:39.830> that's

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
might kick the can here that's that's

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.800 
might kick the can here that's that's
good<00:04:40.430> too<00:04:40.580> sometimes<00:04:41.030> versus<00:04:41.360> going<00:04:41.570> all<00:04:41.720> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
good too sometimes versus going all the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.230 
good too sometimes versus going all the
way<00:04:41.840> around<00:04:42.020> you're<00:04:42.650> trying<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.070> develop<00:04:43.340> the

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
way around you're trying to develop the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.810 
way around you're trying to develop the
ability<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.980> might<00:04:46.160> think<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.460> guy's<00:04:46.670> in

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
ability to you might think this guy's in

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.120 
ability to you might think this guy's in
range<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.330> throw<00:04:47.630> your<00:04:47.780> kick<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.170> you<00:04:48.740> notice

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
range you throw your kick and you notice

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.650 
range you throw your kick and you notice
he<00:04:49.550> moves<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:49.940> range<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.360> your<00:04:50.480> kicks

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
he moves that range for your kicks

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.120 
he moves that range for your kicks
already<00:04:50.900> on<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.080> way<00:04:51.170> so<00:04:51.740> you're<00:04:51.860> gonna<00:04:51.950> move

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
already on the way so you're gonna move

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.220 
already on the way so you're gonna move
up<00:04:52.250> right<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.210> if<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.420> see<00:04:53.600> that<00:04:53.630> then<00:04:54.200> you

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
up right so if you see that then you

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.260 
up right so if you see that then you
don't<00:04:54.440> want<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.830> go<00:04:54.980> all<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.220> way<00:04:55.280> around<00:04:55.610> and

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
don't want to go all the way around and

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.350 
don't want to go all the way around and
you<00:04:56.750> pull<00:04:57.260> your<00:04:57.410> kid<00:04:57.760> but<00:04:58.760> sometimes<00:04:59.180> you

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
you pull your kid but sometimes you

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.640 
you pull your kid but sometimes you
don't<00:04:59.450> realize<00:04:59.690> he's<00:05:00.140> out<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.290> range<00:05:00.470> I've

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
don't realize he's out of range I've

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.620 
don't realize he's out of range I've
done<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:01.100> couple<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.520> times<00:05:01.790> in<00:05:01.970> different

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
done this a couple of times in different

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.780 
done this a couple of times in different
fights<00:05:03.020> right<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.620> was<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.160> certain<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.670> was

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
fights right I was so certain I was

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.280 
fights right I was so certain I was
gonna<00:05:04.940> kick<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.330> leg<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.930> was<00:05:06.140> just

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
gonna kick that leg that I was just

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.040 
gonna kick that leg that I was just
fighting<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.790> then<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.270> was<00:05:08.360> committed<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
fighting and then I was committed to it

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.230 
fighting and then I was committed to it
and<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.950> just<00:05:10.040> end<00:05:10.310> up<00:05:10.370> going<00:05:10.610> around<00:05:10.700> which

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
and you just end up going around which

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.730 
and you just end up going around which
you<00:05:11.690> don't<00:05:11.840> ever<00:05:12.020> want<00:05:12.200> to<00:05:12.230> turn<00:05:12.350> your<00:05:12.500> back

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
you don't ever want to turn your back

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.500 
you don't ever want to turn your back
but<00:05:13.010> usually<00:05:13.490> if<00:05:13.580> he<00:05:13.760> gets<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.360> way

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
but usually if he gets out of the way

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.830 
but usually if he gets out of the way
that<00:05:15.080> far<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.710> you're<00:05:16.130> going<00:05:16.340> at<00:05:16.430> full<00:05:16.610> speed

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
that far and you're going at full speed

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.140 
that far and you're going at full speed
usually<00:05:17.840> you're<00:05:18.530> gonna<00:05:18.650> be<00:05:18.830> facing<00:05:19.610> him<00:05:19.940> again

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
usually you're gonna be facing him again

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.540 
usually you're gonna be facing him again
before<00:05:20.270> he<00:05:20.450> has<00:05:20.630> time<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:21.230> to<00:05:21.770> counter<00:05:22.130> but

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
before he has time to to counter but

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.160 
before he has time to to counter but
then<00:05:23.120> you<00:05:23.210> have<00:05:23.360> other<00:05:23.510> guys<00:05:23.720> that<00:05:23.870> are<00:05:23.930> just

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
then you have other guys that are just

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.900 
then you have other guys that are just
really<00:05:24.590> really<00:05:24.740> good<00:05:25.070> with<00:05:25.190> her<00:05:25.310> distancing

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
really really good with her distancing

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.610 
really really good with her distancing
their<00:05:26.090> timing<00:05:26.480> and<00:05:26.630> they're<00:05:27.050> gonna<00:05:27.200> catch<00:05:27.440> it

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
their timing and they're gonna catch it

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.870 
their timing and they're gonna catch it
but<00:05:28.750> that's<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:30.110> as<00:05:30.260> far<00:05:30.470> as<00:05:30.880> shadowboxing
