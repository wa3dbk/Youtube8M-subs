00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
so on the Left Behind that concrete wall

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
so on the Left Behind that concrete wall
our<00:00:13.200> main<00:00:13.349> lecture<00:00:13.530> theatres<00:00:14.000> which<00:00:15.000> are<00:00:15.800> one

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
our main lecture theatres which are one

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.260 
our main lecture theatres which are one
big<00:00:17.430> space<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:18.170> 450<00:00:19.170> it'll<00:00:19.890> take<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.279> then<00:00:20.789> can

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
big space of 450 it'll take and then can

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
big space of 450 it'll take and then can
be<00:00:21.330> split<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.869> two<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> right<00:00:23.070> this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
be split into two so on the right this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.650 
be split into two so on the right this
one<00:00:23.609> leads<00:00:23.789> through<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.359> one<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.480> these

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
one leads through to the one of these

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.269 
one leads through to the one of these
