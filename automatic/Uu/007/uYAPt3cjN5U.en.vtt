that's<00:05:52.560> what<00:05:52.680> it<00:05:52.770> was<00:05:52.860> designed<00:05:52.949> for<00:05:53.430> so<00:05:53.909> you

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
that's what it was designed for so you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.339 
that's what it was designed for so you
check<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.180> video<00:05:54.419> and<00:05:54.629> see<00:05:54.750> what<00:05:54.960> it<00:05:55.050> sounds

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
check that video and see what it sounds

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.659 
check that video and see what it sounds
like<00:05:55.379> I<00:05:55.560> recommend<00:05:55.949> it<00:05:56.039> as<00:05:56.250> strictly<00:05:56.460> a

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
like I recommend it as strictly a

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.610 
like I recommend it as strictly a
shotgun<00:05:57.150> mic<00:05:57.330> it's<00:05:57.479> made<00:05:57.750> for<00:05:57.960> booming<00:05:58.349> but

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
shotgun mic it's made for booming but

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.019 
shotgun mic it's made for booming but
ultimately<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:59.069> would<00:05:59.159> say<00:05:59.339> just<00:05:59.370> use<00:05:59.729> exactly

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
ultimately I would say just use exactly

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.219 
ultimately I would say just use exactly
what<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.330> have<00:06:00.539> if<00:06:00.719> you<00:06:00.779> have<00:06:00.900> a<00:06:00.930> microphone

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
what you have if you have a microphone

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.749 
what you have if you have a microphone
if<00:06:01.409> you<00:06:01.500> have<00:06:01.589> a<00:06:01.620> camera<00:06:01.860> start<00:06:02.250> making<00:06:02.520> movies

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
if you have a camera start making movies

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.070 
if you have a camera start making movies
with<00:06:02.909> that<00:06:03.060> stuff<00:06:03.330> see<00:06:03.569> how<00:06:03.689> well<00:06:03.839> it<00:06:03.870> works

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
with that stuff see how well it works

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.390 
with that stuff see how well it works
for<00:06:04.259> you<00:06:04.409> and<00:06:04.589> if<00:06:04.650> it<00:06:04.740> doesn't<00:06:04.979> work<00:06:05.009> for<00:06:05.279> you

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
for you and if it doesn't work for you

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.790 
for you and if it doesn't work for you
maybe<00:06:05.789> upgrade<00:06:06.029> to<00:06:06.270> something<00:06:06.419> or<00:06:06.810> maybe<00:06:07.560> put

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
maybe upgrade to something or maybe put

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.990 
maybe upgrade to something or maybe put
it<00:06:07.889> in<00:06:07.979> a<00:06:08.039> different<00:06:08.219> scenario<00:06:08.580> use<00:06:08.969> a

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
it in a different scenario use a

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.420 
it in a different scenario use a
differently<00:06:09.449> experiment<00:06:10.139> practice<00:06:10.650> all<00:06:11.159> that

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
differently experiment practice all that

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.649 
differently experiment practice all that
kind<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.669> stuff<00:06:11.729> and<00:06:12.029> I<00:06:12.089> think<00:06:12.270> you'll<00:06:12.360> be<00:06:12.419> fine

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
kind of stuff and I think you'll be fine

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.119 
kind of stuff and I think you'll be fine
that's<00:06:12.960> how<00:06:13.080> you<00:06:13.139> learn<00:06:13.289> you<00:06:13.529> should<00:06:13.680> use<00:06:13.949> what

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
that's how you learn you should use what

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.649 
that's how you learn you should use what
you<00:06:14.219> have<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.610> then<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:14.849> kind<00:06:15.089> of<00:06:15.150> build<00:06:15.330> upon

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
you have and then you kind of build upon

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:16.879 
you have and then you kind of build upon
that<00:06:15.689> knowledge<00:06:16.139> that<00:06:16.289> you<00:06:16.379> learn<00:06:16.529> from<00:06:16.680> just

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
that knowledge that you learn from just

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.649 
that knowledge that you learn from just
the<00:06:16.979> real<00:06:17.129> basic<00:06:17.580> stuff<00:06:17.849> and<00:06:18.029> move<00:06:18.300> on<00:06:18.449> to<00:06:18.539> more

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
the real basic stuff and move on to more

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.110 
the real basic stuff and move on to more
