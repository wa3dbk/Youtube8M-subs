00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.820
 I find it interesting he goes himself I think it's good that he's looking at us as 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.459
 Parents have their children 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:09.970
 So I'm fit again 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.599
 that will be the Tablet PC that actually says it all works 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.949
 the eldersrat legally no longer work properly I think we are good 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.999
 very quickly a disaster 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.789
 So maybe it's the poem the Beats makes the fundraiser of that 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.640
 when we finally come new after the heavy storms quite simple 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.699
 not fit 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.449
 and I see that differently 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.670
 that is not self-evident can not change 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.820
 slightly relaxed in the hand 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.410
 to learn from employees that is an implementation that made 90 Rome 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.300
 such topics as PCs for schools in the room cares 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.910
 myself as well as fun to see percent like those around students and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.290
 Percent empty but also just here with just tackled so that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.360
 Icing is the fact that percent among all these PCs somewhere 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 hides the thousandth 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.750
 Percent of that has been donated to school and so that really fits 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.160
 and it was a win-win situation you can say so nicely neo-German and me 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.570
 Honestly, the percent still many other companies honestly hope for this example 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.000
 Follow and often become wise schools 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 r allowed into the funds 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.480
 So rather the kids do not criticize the internet they donated them 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.150
 on 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 the land has to go and can be tapped to the one 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.790
 DÃ¼ren 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 the debt then on the power school completely seen what deals 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.610
 are available and can then decide what they need of it 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.050
 could and therefore the power school completely contact 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.549
 This creates a kind 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.159
 Sal Marketplace with supply and demand only that this costs nothing and also the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.910
 Companies do not have to pay 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.850
 there are already some companies with 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.940
 but also many more schools 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.290
 and the trick here is that all communication via the smartphone 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.840
 runs to Zeus a little hedgehog professional and for everyone 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.589
 easiest 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.379
 that makes school for the schools 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.719
 where they off something 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.189
 the guides Frankfurt that makes school 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.019
 who comes and when they come 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.209
 as simple as that 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.209
 yes that makes school is an intelligent platform 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.110
 used the CS of companies 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 collects the offer binds school provides 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.840
 for easy communication as well as worried and that is a great incentive 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.609
 there 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.409
 for us the commitment from the schools of the teachers and the students the 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.439
 Huge over the 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 PCs and the possibilities gained with it 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.909
 help them do the school 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.870
 and thus to the pupils and teachers all over Germany their poetry books
