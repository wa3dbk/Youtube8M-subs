00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.649 

alright<00:00:01.770> guess<00:00:01.979> so<00:00:02.970> we<00:00:03.060> got<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> few<00:00:03.419> cases

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
alright guess so we got a few cases

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.010 
alright guess so we got a few cases
after<00:00:04.170> yesterday's<00:00:04.859> unboxing<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:06.120> think<00:00:06.870> it

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
after yesterday's unboxing I think it

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.040 
after yesterday's unboxing I think it
would<00:00:07.170> be<00:00:07.550> not<00:00:08.550> such<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.910> terrible<00:00:09.059> idea<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
would be not such a terrible idea to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.780 
would be not such a terrible idea to
open<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:11.490> few<00:00:11.790> more<00:00:12.000> cases<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:13.139> if<00:00:13.790> we

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
open a few more cases and see if we

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.870 
open a few more cases and see if we
possibly<00:00:15.389> maybe<00:00:16.279> still<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> magic

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
possibly maybe still have the magic

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.929 
possibly maybe still have the magic
