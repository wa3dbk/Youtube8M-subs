we<00:00:11.170> welcome<00:00:11.470> you<00:00:11.800> everybody<00:00:12.220> to<00:00:12.519> the<00:00:12.640> DARPA

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
we welcome you everybody to the DARPA

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.019 
we welcome you everybody to the DARPA
Robotics<00:00:13.180> Challenge<00:00:13.630> the<00:00:14.170> trials<00:00:14.710> of<00:00:14.890> 2013<00:00:15.820> on

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
Robotics Challenge the trials of 2013 on

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.210 
Robotics Challenge the trials of 2013 on
another<00:00:16.299> the<00:00:16.630> DRC<00:00:17.079> trials<00:00:17.409> were<00:00:17.560> incredibly

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
another the DRC trials were incredibly

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.739 
another the DRC trials were incredibly
important<00:00:18.699> because<00:00:18.849> they<00:00:19.210> helped<00:00:19.509> us<00:00:19.599> to

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:19.749 
important because they helped us to

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.079 
important because they helped us to
establish<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.259> baseline<00:00:20.710> for<00:00:21.220> how<00:00:21.400> good<00:00:21.669> robots

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.089 
establish a baseline for how good robots

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.870 
establish a baseline for how good robots
could<00:00:22.390> be<00:00:22.630> at<00:00:23.259> the<00:00:23.439> time<00:00:23.679> and<00:00:24.009> so<00:00:24.489> they<00:00:24.640> helped

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
could be at the time and so they helped

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.249 
could be at the time and so they helped
us<00:00:24.939> establish<00:00:25.150> here's<00:00:25.749> where<00:00:25.869> we're<00:00:26.019> starting

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
us establish here's where we're starting

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.499 
us establish here's where we're starting
from<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:27.130> now<00:00:27.339> the<00:00:27.399> question<00:00:27.669> is<00:00:27.880> how<00:00:28.060> far<00:00:28.329> can

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
from and now the question is how far can

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.229 
from and now the question is how far can
we<00:00:28.659> go<00:00:28.689> in<00:00:29.169> 18<00:00:29.560> months<00:00:29.710> so<00:00:30.609> what<00:00:30.759> we<00:00:30.880> learn<00:00:31.060> in

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
we go in 18 months so what we learn in

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.389 
we go in 18 months so what we learn in
Miami<00:00:31.659> is<00:00:32.200> things<00:00:32.559> that<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.890> just<00:00:32.920> never

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
Miami is things that you just never

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.610 
Miami is things that you just never
really<00:00:33.699> seen<00:00:34.000> in<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.180> lab<00:00:34.390> like<00:00:34.719> wind<00:00:35.079> gusts

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
really seen in the lab like wind gusts

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.380 
really seen in the lab like wind gusts
suddenly<00:00:36.219> you<00:00:36.399> knows<00:00:36.550> 10<00:00:36.820> miles<00:00:37.030> per<00:00:37.149> hour

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
suddenly you knows 10 miles per hour

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.020 
suddenly you knows 10 miles per hour
winds<00:00:37.780> we've<00:00:38.170> accounted<00:00:38.500> for<00:00:38.980> that<00:00:39.190> what<00:00:40.000> we

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
winds we've accounted for that what we

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.459 
winds we've accounted for that what we
learned<00:00:40.329> in<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.600> DARPA<00:00:41.019> Robotics<00:00:41.140> Challenge

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
learned in the DARPA Robotics Challenge

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.619 
learned in the DARPA Robotics Challenge
trials<00:00:42.219> was<00:00:42.609> that<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.000> hardware<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
trials was that the hardware that the

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.209 
trials was that the hardware that the
teams<00:00:43.840> were<00:00:44.019> bringing<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.469> the<00:00:44.590> challenge<00:00:45.039> was

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
teams were bringing to the challenge was

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.910 
teams were bringing to the challenge was
in<00:00:45.399> fact<00:00:45.579> quite<00:00:45.850> good<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.350> we've<00:00:47.530> learned<00:00:47.739> now

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
in fact quite good but we've learned now

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.740 
in fact quite good but we've learned now
to<00:00:47.980> do<00:00:48.399> for<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:48.820> finals<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
to do for the finals because the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.689 
to do for the finals because the
hardware<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:50.289> taken<00:00:50.589> care<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.859> is<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.370> push<00:00:51.550> the

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
hardware is taken care of is to push the

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.459 
hardware is taken care of is to push the
teams<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.120> develop<00:00:52.269> more<00:00:52.629> autonomy<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.350> their

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
teams to develop more autonomy in their

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.099 
teams to develop more autonomy in their
software<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.160> so<00:00:55.030> we've<00:00:55.329> cut<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.660> cord<00:00:55.899> we've

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
software and so we've cut the cord we've

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.450 
software and so we've cut the cord we've
cut<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.410> power<00:00:56.589> cord<00:00:56.980> we've<00:00:57.190> cut<00:00:57.429> the

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
cut the power cord we've cut the

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.399 
cut the power cord we've cut the
communications<00:00:58.359> cord<00:00:58.659> and<00:00:58.960> we've<00:00:59.140> cut<00:00:59.379> the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
communications cord and we've cut the

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.919 
communications cord and we've cut the
safety<00:01:00.129> cord<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:00.879> now<00:01:01.239> what<00:01:01.359> we<00:01:01.510> need<00:01:01.539> to<00:01:01.690> do

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
safety cord and now what we need to do

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.800 
safety cord and now what we need to do
is<00:01:02.289> to<00:01:02.620> say<00:01:03.159> okay<00:01:03.609> with<00:01:03.940> all<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.210> those<00:01:04.420> cords

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 
is to say okay with all of those cords

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.350 
is to say okay with all of those cords
cut<00:01:05.050> how<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:05.980> make<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.280> robot<00:01:06.640> work<00:01:06.880> semi

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
cut how can you make the robot work semi

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.720 
cut how can you make the robot work semi
independently<00:01:08.110> from<00:01:08.260> human<00:01:08.590> beings<00:01:08.920> despite

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
independently from human beings despite

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.250 
independently from human beings despite
the<00:01:09.880> fact<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.150> communications<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.930> not<00:01:11.080> so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
the fact that communications is not so

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.920 
the fact that communications is not so
good<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.620> between<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.010> two<00:01:12.390> since<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.480> trials

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
good in between the two since the trials

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.570 
good in between the two since the trials
we've<00:01:14.140> been<00:01:14.260> focusing<00:01:14.710> heavily<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.160> making

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
we've been focusing heavily on making

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.150 
we've been focusing heavily on making
our<00:01:15.700> system<00:01:16.030> more<00:01:16.300> robust<00:01:16.890> better<00:01:17.890> at

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
our system more robust better at

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.000 
our system more robust better at
localizing<00:01:18.940> where<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.270> robot<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:20.010> improving

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
localizing where the robot is improving

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.220 
localizing where the robot is improving
the<00:01:21.160> ability<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.820> robot<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.510> finally

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
the ability for the robot to finally

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.260 
the ability for the robot to finally
position<00:01:23.740> its<00:01:23.980> ends<00:01:24.700> where<00:01:24.850> they<00:01:24.940> need<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.150> go

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
position its ends where they need to go

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.770 
position its ends where they need to go
to<00:01:25.480> manipulate<00:01:26.200> objects<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:27.690> think<00:01:28.690> we've

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
to manipulate objects I think we've

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.030 
to manipulate objects I think we've
learned<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.110> couple<00:01:29.230> things<00:01:29.410> this<00:01:29.800> week

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
learned a couple things this week

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.400 
learned a couple things this week
watching<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.850> team's<00:01:31.060> practice<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:32.170> first

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
watching the team's practice the first

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.710 
watching the team's practice the first
is<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.980> not<00:01:33.640> very<00:01:33.670> many<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.240> teams<00:01:34.480> have

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
is that not very many of the teams have

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.900 
is that not very many of the teams have
practiced<00:01:35.170> falling<00:01:35.590> down<00:01:35.800> yet<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.430> fact<00:01:36.730> we

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
practiced falling down yet in fact we

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.760 
practiced falling down yet in fact we
only<00:01:37.150> saw<00:01:37.390> one<00:01:37.420> robot<00:01:37.960> fall<00:01:38.200> down<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.620> whole

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
only saw one robot fall down the whole

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.340 
only saw one robot fall down the whole
time<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.790> was<00:01:39.910> by<00:01:40.060> accident<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.050> I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
time and that was by accident and so I

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.780 
time and that was by accident and so I
think<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.650> teams<00:01:41.860> have<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.070> lot<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.310> work<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.640> do

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
think the teams have a lot of work to do

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.940 
think the teams have a lot of work to do
doing<00:01:43.630> real<00:01:43.810> testing<00:01:44.260> having<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.620> robots

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
doing real testing having the robots

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.100 
doing real testing having the robots
fall<00:01:45.160> down<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.580> get<00:01:45.880> back<00:01:46.090> up<00:01:46.300> now<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:46.840> more

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
fall down and get back up now it's more

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.230 
fall down and get back up now it's more
stable<00:01:47.350> we're<00:01:47.800> reliable<00:01:48.400> now<00:01:48.670> can<00:01:48.880> fall

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
stable we're reliable now can fall

safely stand up on its own and we did a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.090 
safely stand up on its own and we did a
lot<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.060> rapid<00:01:52.470> prototyping<00:01:53.470> for<00:01:53.710> testing

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
lot of rapid prototyping for testing

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.040 
lot of rapid prototyping for testing
different<00:01:54.250> things<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:55.360> particular<00:01:55.840> we<00:01:55.930> have

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
different things in particular we have

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.630 
different things in particular we have
different<00:01:56.470> type<00:01:56.620> of<00:01:56.650> hand<00:01:57.010> we're<00:01:57.220> testing<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
different type of hand we're testing the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.030 
different type of hand we're testing the
hook<00:01:58.120> set<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.960> vectors<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.680> see<00:01:59.860> which

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
hook set and the vectors to see which

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.160 
hook set and the vectors to see which
one<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.340> more<00:02:00.550> effective<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.570> structure<00:02:02.050> is

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
one is more effective the structure is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.260 
one is more effective the structure is
much<00:02:02.410> more<00:02:02.620> stable<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.400> knee<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.940> must

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
much more stable the knee is must

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.330 
much more stable the knee is must
strengthen<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.870> I<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.110> walk<00:02:05.380> up<00:02:05.410> steps<00:02:06.010> and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
strengthen so I can walk up steps and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.630 
strengthen so I can walk up steps and
handle<00:02:07.150> rough<00:02:07.300> terrain<00:02:07.570> much<00:02:07.720> more<00:02:07.900> effective

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
handle rough terrain much more effective

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.250 
handle rough terrain much more effective
the<00:02:09.640> other<00:02:09.759> thing<00:02:09.970> we<00:02:10.119> saw<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.020> teams

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the other thing we saw is that the teams

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.900 
the other thing we saw is that the teams
aren't<00:02:11.500> going<00:02:11.800> quite<00:02:12.040> as<00:02:12.070> fast<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:12.670> we<00:02:12.820> had

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
aren't going quite as fast as we had

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.680 
aren't going quite as fast as we had
hoped<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.420> so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
hoped and so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.110 
hoped and so
I<00:02:13.720> want<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.740> change<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.370> challenge<00:02:15.850> just<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
I want to change the challenge just a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.460 
I want to change the challenge just a
little<00:02:16.360> bit<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.690> make<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.200> they're

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
little bit to make it so that they're

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.830 
little bit to make it so that they're
incentivized<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:18.190> go<00:02:18.370> faster<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.660> right

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
incentivized to go faster and so right

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.320 
incentivized to go faster and so right
now<00:02:19.900> we're<00:02:20.290> anticipating<00:02:21.120> coalescing<00:02:22.120> some

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
now we're anticipating coalescing some

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.210 
now we're anticipating coalescing some
of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> tasks<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.380> together<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.190> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
of the tasks to be together so that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.980 
of the tasks to be together so that
there's<00:02:24.550> not<00:02:24.640> quite<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.180> many<00:02:25.360> task<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.840> get

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
there's not quite so many task to get

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.420 
there's not quite so many task to get
through<00:02:26.200> even<00:02:26.470> though<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.860> variety<00:02:27.250> will

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
through even though the variety will

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.250 
through even though the variety will
still<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> same<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:28.840> think<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.080> will

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
still be the same and we think that will

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.620 
still be the same and we think that will
give<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.590> team's<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.340> incentive<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> go<00:02:31.600> a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
give the team's the incentive to go a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
give the team's the incentive to go a
little<00:02:31.810> bit<00:02:32.020> faster<00:02:32.170> through<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.800> them

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
little bit faster through all of them

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.160 
little bit faster through all of them
we've<00:02:34.240> seen<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> number<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.930> teams

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
we've seen a number of teams

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.140 
we've seen a number of teams
particularly<00:02:35.860> from<00:02:36.070> Korea<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.610> from<00:02:36.790> Japan

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
particularly from Korea and from Japan

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.060 
particularly from Korea and from Japan
really<00:02:37.930> step<00:02:38.140> up<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.440> plate<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.740> work

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
really step up to the plate and work

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.190 
really step up to the plate and work
very<00:02:39.400> hard<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.940> make<00:02:40.090> their<00:02:40.390> systems<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.960> lot

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
very hard to make their systems a lot

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.620 
very hard to make their systems a lot
better<00:02:41.410> than<00:02:41.560> they<00:02:41.650> were<00:02:41.710> before<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:43.120> changed

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
better than they were before we changed

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.860 
better than they were before we changed
everything<00:02:44.200> since<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.370> trial<00:02:45.820> do<00:02:46.360> everything

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
everything since a trial do everything

everything since a trial do everything
possible<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:49.210> trials<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.620> met<00:02:51.340> very

possible to in trials that we met very

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.070 
possible to in trials that we met very

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
many problems on the our robot so first

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.520 
many problems on the our robot so first

we've<00:03:13.990> mostly<00:03:14.560> worked<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.280> improvements<00:03:16.000> to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
we've mostly worked on improvements to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.320 
we've mostly worked on improvements to
the<00:03:16.300> software<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:18.100> been<00:03:18.370> working<00:03:19.000> on

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
the software we have been working on

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.020 
the software we have been working on
adding<00:03:19.600> more<00:03:19.959> autonomy<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.980> system<00:03:21.370> so

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
adding more autonomy to the system so

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
adding more autonomy to the system so
that<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.660> robot<00:03:23.050> will<00:03:23.200> be<00:03:23.320> faster<00:03:23.830> by<00:03:24.100> doing

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
that the robot will be faster by doing

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.270 
that the robot will be faster by doing
more<00:03:24.459> things<00:03:24.640> itself<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.100> will

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
more things itself and so that it will

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.490 
more things itself and so that it will
be<00:03:27.310> more<00:03:27.850> robust<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.690> restrictions<00:03:29.170> on

of beefed up the visual system so almost

of beefed up the visual system so almost

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.100 
know that some of the teams will have
harder<00:03:44.920> luck<00:03:45.130> or<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.640> whatever<00:03:45.790> reason<00:03:46.300> won't

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
harder luck or for whatever reason won't

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.020 
harder luck or for whatever reason won't

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
think we have some very very strong

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.470 
think we have some very very strong
teams

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480
