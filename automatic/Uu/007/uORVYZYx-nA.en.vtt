up to the back of my deltoids so on each

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
up to the back of my deltoids so on each
of<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.640> 10<00:01:41.990> reps<00:01:45.079> so

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

between your
thumbs<00:02:12.870> evenly<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> weights<00:02:14.190> distributed

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
thumbs evenly so the weights distributed

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.340 
thumbs evenly so the weights distributed
for<00:02:16.110> both<00:02:16.430> arms<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:18.660> should<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.080> feel

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
for both arms you should really feel

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.740 
for both arms you should really feel
this<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.390> inside<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.870> your<00:02:22.080> tricep

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
this on the or the inside of your tricep

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.170 
this on the or the inside of your tricep
if<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.990> makes<00:02:25.170> any<00:02:25.320> sense<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.830> does<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> me<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
if that makes any sense it does to me so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.160

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
head like you're drawing an imaginary

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.259 
head like you're drawing an imaginary
line<00:04:07.040> ten<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.190> those<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:11.070> I<00:04:11.160> did<00:04:11.400> my<00:04:11.790> right<00:04:12.030> arm

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
up and then down like I said remember

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.330 
up and then down like I said remember
not<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.910> let<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> dumbbell<00:04:27.840> with<00:04:28.020> God<00:04:28.260> fall<00:04:28.650> so

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
not to let the dumbbell with God fall so

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.629 
not to let the dumbbell with God fall so
it's<00:04:29.460> not<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:30.229> it's<00:04:31.229> not<00:04:31.470> letting<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:32.040> go<00:04:32.610> and

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
it's not this it's not letting it go and

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.350 
it's not this it's not letting it go and
then<00:04:33.080> your<00:04:34.080> hand<00:04:34.350> fall<00:04:34.830> down<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.760> side<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.240> it

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
then your hand fall down the side of it

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.550 
then your hand fall down the side of it
that's<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.660> little<00:04:36.870> cheat<00:04:37.229> it's<00:04:38.130> straight<00:04:39.000> up

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.450 
that's a little cheat it's straight up
holding<00:04:40.560> tight<00:04:41.120> down<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.949> then<00:04:44.130> back<00:04:44.310> up<00:04:46.460> so

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
holding tight down and then back up so

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.000 
holding tight down and then back up so
then<00:04:47.610> you'll<00:04:47.760> do<00:04:47.880> ten<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.120> those<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.830> can

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
then you'll do ten of those and you can

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.770 
then you'll do ten of those and you can
definitely<00:04:50.190> feel<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.760> burn<00:04:50.970> in<00:04:51.210> your<00:04:51.240> tricep

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
and by the end of its the second rep you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.279 
and by the end of its the second rep you
should<00:04:54.330> definitely<00:04:54.630> feel<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.900> in<00:04:54.990> your<00:04:55.110> biceps

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289

as<00:04:55.710> well<00:04:55.889> like<00:04:56.789> I<00:04:56.940> said<00:04:57.210> it's<00:04:58.199> up<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.620> this

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
as well like I said it's up to you this

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.740 
as well like I said it's up to you this
is<00:04:59.250> what<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.639> tricep<00:05:00.030> kickback<00:05:00.360> looks<00:05:00.570> like

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
is what the tricep kickback looks like

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.900 
is what the tricep kickback looks like
with<00:05:00.900> both<00:05:01.080> ways<00:05:01.289> I'll<00:05:01.530> do<00:05:01.680> it<00:05:01.800> from<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.130> front

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
with both ways I'll do it from the front

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.129 
with both ways I'll do it from the front
so<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.449> see<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:05.340> just<00:05:06.139> pointing

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
so that you can see it's just pointing

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.640 
so that you can see it's just pointing
your<00:05:07.260> elbows<00:05:07.650> straight<00:05:08.070> back<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:09.650> following

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
your elbows straight back and following

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.760 
your elbows straight back and following
through<00:05:10.889> with<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.190> weights<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:13.620> looks

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
through with the weights so it looks

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.060 
through with the weights so it looks
like<00:05:13.830> this<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:17.100> then<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.800> following<00:05:19.800> through

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
like this and then the following through

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.629 
like this and then the following through
exercises<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:22.050> only<00:05:22.200> eat<00:05:22.410> one<00:05:22.620> weight<00:05:22.800> so

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
exercises you only eat one weight so

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.770 
exercises you only eat one weight so

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
it's just straight up with the other

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.210 
it's just straight up with the other
