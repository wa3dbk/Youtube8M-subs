00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello to all and we all 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
 found today with fishing the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 potato and banana for a gameplay 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.980
 express project since it's going to be a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.189
 gameplay on modern warfare 2 it'll be 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.060
 a nuclear among other bone passes 12 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.560
 since 90% of alarm kills are going to be 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.150
 realized in the past twelve it's going to 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.420
 unfold in domination on the map this goal 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.489
 and it's a nuclear in 83 seconds 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.860
 so much to say a nuclear express 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.960
 it's a gameplay made by one of the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.120
 subscribers with the new series 1 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 the gold subscriber so today we will get 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 find with mathis hd so you have 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.630
 as usual his chain in the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.920
 description if I go a little bit more 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.170
 faster than the normal for the comment 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 Harry know this is normal because the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.490
 gameplay is fast enough 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.409
 all in all it's nuclear less 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.390
 of two minutes so you really have to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.409
 introduce the player and so on it's 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.820
 still the goal 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.590
 by the way I would like to thank you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 since apparently one of the last 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.939
 subscribers having proposed a 26 gameplay and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.579
 which I retained it was the moa b 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.570
 in search and destruction 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.640
 some of you have come back and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.329
 congratulated me then there I was on the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.999
 ass I got gg messages hypno thanks 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.859
 to you and the team reds he doubled his 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.569
 subscribers then I was seeing it was at 4 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.700
 cents at that moment so I assumed 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.810
 that he was 200 before so basically 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 it was in a party one because 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 it was really the video that was 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.200
 four hours they were published 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.880
 perhaps 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.340
 if I calculate well she would have won 200 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.079
 subscribers eh well listen that makes me super 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.909
 pleasure like I always say it makes me 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.259
 even more fun when I win 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.670
 subscribers to people that when I 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.950
 win me even so I do not know I have to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.780
 to be sado maso or what I do not know 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.320
 but in any case it makes me super 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.119
 pleasure 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.500
 I had already said on my channel with 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.929
 the famous favorite deep nos who is 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.130
 pretty much the same concept but that's it 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.750
 in any case, know that for 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.219
 to apply the subscriber in gold is simple 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.319
 it's massacres on old 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.060
 roommates but big massacre 1 lo 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.549
 on old roommates and send you 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 a little message with nautical 84 @ 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.110
 gmail dot com is just you 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.519
 say here I think I realized a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.650
 good gameplay you are describing your 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.690
 gameplay etc and you give me the link 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.890
 have listed some of this one have some 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.430
 commented since it's me who 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.620
 comments 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.140
 so here it is a gameplay that has 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.610
 a little bit on the subscriber's channel 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.810
 since he already had claude and 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.430
 comment but he still had two 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.410
 sides send it to me listed 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.660
 have commented I found this 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.700
 performance good enough for you 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.400
 propose it and then it changes since we 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 we have very few mw2 besides I 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.549
 I'll try to fix it to you 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.560
 a little bit more to be w2 so voila 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.480
 it was like you finally saw it 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 did a little fail it was a nuclear 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.200
 and not nm so you have had 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.639
 nuclear on moder finally from in 83 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.139
 seconds I put a little timecode of a 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.720
 year a little time to show his and 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.690
 in passing exclude them from the game so 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.549
 here is a nice little gameplay of mantis 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.870
 hd you have the link of his chain in 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.459
 the description I tell you all and 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.049
 all wear well it's techno to the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.049
