00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.250 
floating
and<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.920> believe<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.790> gravel<00:02:14.360> pathways<00:02:14.960> if

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.620 
and I believe the gravel pathways if
it's<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:15.680> water<00:02:15.980> they<00:02:16.700> will<00:02:16.940> replace<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.480> with

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
it's on water they will replace it with

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.680 
it's on water they will replace it with
wooden<00:02:18.080> planks<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:19.370> pretty<00:02:19.550> cool<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.600> the
