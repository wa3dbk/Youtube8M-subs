00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.389
 good morning and welcome pilots here and 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.309
 scandals and I'm sorry that during the 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.230
 last weeks I failed to 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.269
 but I had to record new videos 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.910
 technical problems that forced me 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.550
 to a forced break but here I am here today 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.470
 for you today I want to address a 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.630
 topic that concerns both the mode 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.630
 arcade that the drivers who compete 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.820
 in the historical battle and not the last 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.800
 white flies that face food 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.500
 rearmed this today we will talk about 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.750
 ballistics ballistics and that science 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.610
 who studies the motion of projectiles 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.830
 he has been studying it since ancient times 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.750
 even at the time of the catapults of the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.420
 scorpions of the bartenders until they arrive 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.790
 today the most modern weapons 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.310
 ballistics is divided into three big ones below 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.320
 branches or internal ballistic that is 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.020
 that science that studies motion 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.960
 inside the barrel of the weapon la 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.939
 external ballistics that studies the motion of the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.250
 bullets in outer space ed 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.810
 finally the terminal ballistics that he studies 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.300
 the effect of the bullet 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 when he meets his target because 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.810
 I want to talk about ballistics because 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.090
 we often meet again 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.950
 during our battles to have to do 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 the accounts with refined formulas 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 physical that ghegin has integrated into 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 work curtains and its dynamics in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.900
 way too fussy 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.390
 let's start with rudimentary principles 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.180
 or because a bullet proceeds 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.520
 straight and to which perhaps this bullet 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.950
 is subjected and how we identify the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.460
 speed at which this bullet was 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.710
 shot 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.840
 then meanwhile we must define that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.180
 in the barrel of our machine gun and o 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.010
 cannon there is a tour line to this 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.260
 rifling allows the projectile to 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.140
 come out with a spin on your own 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.250
 axis that allows a stabilization 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.260
 fruit the same principle as 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.570
 the gyroscope of the top in fact the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.270
 the rifling of the cane does nothing else 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.549
 that let the bullet spin on his 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.920
 same axis and as with the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.960
 spinning top keeps it straight towards 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.539
 your target the speed of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.729
 bullet instead is proportional to the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.159
 barrel length 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.110
 a cannon that generally has a barrel 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.330
 longer than a machine gun than yours 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.340
 once a barrel longer than a gun 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.470
 certainly has more range than 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.190
 the latter to which forces subjected a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.810
 bullet 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 well actually the bullet is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.890
 mainly subjected only to strength 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.260
 of gravity that tends to attract him to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.810
 soil and is certainly also subject to 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.209
 trite but on the friction we fall into 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.519
 specifications a little too complex for 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.709
 that friction is then influenced by the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.810
 air temperature and humidity e 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.640
 from many other specifications but not 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.690
 I'll be listed in this video 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.640
 award thunder 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.690
 you have certainly noticed that in the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.599
 arcade mode 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.849
 there is really very little to change 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.829
 in fact the same convergence of weapons 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.079
 is set at 800 meters and is not 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.390
 absolutely modifiable though if already 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.519
 look at the historical battle mode 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.799
 we manage to have different range in 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.200
 based on the convergence we give to 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.109
 our own machine guns now I open one 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.540
 parentheses we for convergence we mean 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.959
 the focal point in which our gods 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.639
 interrogators hit a point 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.799
 infinitesimally small or where the 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.489
 fire is concentrated in its maximum 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.370
 power 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.049
 if you try like in the video to set 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.049
 the convergence of machine guns 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.090
 on the wing at 50 meters you will have an effect of 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.069
 this type, however, consider this 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.169
 type of reduced convergence will have 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.000
 definitely a drastic effect on 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.459
 developments of your battle because 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.069
 focus all the fire at 50 meters e 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.900
 will disperse over 50 meters yours 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.840
 bullets with an extremely hole 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.760
 wide from 75 to 100 meters up and vi 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.799
 will make all attempts of 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.139
 hit medium and long targets 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.540
 ray in this part instead or set 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.819
 the bullets at 300 meters and as you see i 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.370
 bullets have reduced dispersion 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.799
 which still makes you guilty though 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.959
 not actually one hundred percent 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.859
 the targets if we hear about them instead 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.810
 800 meters 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.150
 we note that we have a convergence 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.949
 extremely distant than in anyway 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.590
 most cases the pilots do not 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.300
 will use because it is supposed to be 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.700
 have my own 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.650
 almost a kilometer away what 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.330
 which in most cases is a lot 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.160
 rare to recall the concept of 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.140
 spinning top and to explain what they are 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.570
 dynamics that you must always keep in 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.890
 consideration when you shoot them I can 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.420
 explain another effect 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.040
 when the spin of the top 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.960
 begins to decline 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.570
 you will notice that this is the basis 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.550
 will enlarge the cone and try almost to 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.860
 flaunt in a very obvious way 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.070
 this also happens to the bullets therefore 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.930
 after 750 meters the bullet if it will not have 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.790
 plus a rotation on its own axis e 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.980
 will tend to be no longer effective 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.160
 turning over almost even a 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.690
 however, the bullet has other dynamics 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.850
 arising from their rotation that 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.670
 are those related to the step as a step 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.100
 of a bullet, however, we mean how many 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.020
 turn this same bullet on itself 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.610
 himself performs in a second 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.430
 this determines another phenomenon 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.220
 which is the drift that is subject to 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.890
 there is the spiral and or rifling of the barrel 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.580
 in fact a reed that goes into 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.440
 clockwise 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.710
 your bullet will have a drift 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.050
 to the right or right or vice versa if the 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.840
 anti-clockwise reed barrel 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.470
 your bullet discharges towards 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.419
 left 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.700
 but I never have this effect 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.710
 not even found in the full rial 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.680
 battle so I would say that how dynamic it is 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.390
 another ballistic effect is excluded 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.050
 is that of the recoil you will have 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:40.110
 definitely noticed by the 20 mm guns 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.810
 to rise in fact the recoil is based on the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.990
 action principle reaction all the more so 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.660
 bullet and light compared to the mass 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.070
 of the projector even less the effect of 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.820
 recoil is obvious 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.580
 clearly there is a disappear from a 202 mc 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.950
 50 caliber bullet probably 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.260
 also for its recoil size 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.530
 would be extremely obvious 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.230
 we conclude by saying something almost obvious 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.560
 which refers to the trajectory of 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.560
 it aims for target trajectories 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.980
 we mean 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.960
 the point where we are aiming 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.750
 substantially this point coincides 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 with the projection line only ed 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.060
 exclusively shake minimum own 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.730
 because the force of does not intervene 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.340
 gravity or rather intervenes 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.889
 only minimally or long ranges 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.780
 instead the target trajectory is not 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.180
 will never coincide with the line of 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.280
 projection from here derives from it 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.310
 the ace of the cannon or machine gun 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.450
 which causes the effect to be anticipated 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.479
 of gravity 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.760
 I conclude by saying that I hope this 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.370
 tutorial may have been helpful 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.280
