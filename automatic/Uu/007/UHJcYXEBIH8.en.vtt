what can you tell us about neighbors
saying<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> Molotov<00:02:10.630> cocktail<00:02:10.660> was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
saying that a Molotov cocktail was

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.900 
saying that a Molotov cocktail was
thrown<00:02:11.620> into<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.920> house<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.520> know<00:02:12.640> that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
thrown into the house and you know that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610 
thrown into the house and you know that
there<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.599> initial<00:02:13.900> live<00:02:14.110> report<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
there was initial live report of that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.309 
there was initial live report of that
but<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.819> been<00:02:16.030> unfounded<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.630> far<00:02:16.870> we

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
but that it's been unfounded so far we

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.510 
but that it's been unfounded so far we
haven't<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.650> been<00:02:17.800> able<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.130> confirm<00:02:18.340> that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
haven't have been able to confirm that

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.059 
haven't have been able to confirm that
so<00:02:19.270> at<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.510> point<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:20.590> unfounded

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
so at this point it's unfounded

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.530 
so at this point it's unfounded
