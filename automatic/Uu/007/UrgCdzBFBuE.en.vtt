if you can skim the high grass I've hit
that<00:00:13.620> little<00:00:13.950> tree<00:00:14.250> before<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.700> keep

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
that little tree before I keep

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.910 
that little tree before I keep
forgetting<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.690> there<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.590> my<00:00:22.710> last

forgetting it's there so in my last
flight<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.460> thought<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> broke<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.269> motor<00:00:24.480> mount

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
flight I thought I broke the motor mount
but<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> actually<00:00:25.320> broke<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> motor<00:00:28.760> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
but I actually broke the motor and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:01:04.380 
but I actually broke the motor and
here's<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> did<00:00:30.900> it

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.940 

barbie<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.420> partially<00:01:06.350> out<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.830> it's

barbie is partially out and it's
throwing<00:01:07.490> off<00:01:07.700> my<00:01:07.729> balance<00:01:08.300> when<00:01:08.960> i<00:01:09.020> can't<00:01:18.640> see

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
throwing off my balance when i can't see

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.930

my<00:01:19.790> landing<00:01:20.240> gear<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.660> little<00:01:20.990> bent<00:01:21.700> i'm<00:01:22.700> not

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
my landing gear is a little bent i'm not

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.600 
my landing gear is a little bent i'm not
sure<00:01:23.180> what<00:01:23.390> angle<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:23.990> should<00:01:24.170> be<00:01:24.610> that's

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
sure what angle it should be that's

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.249 
sure what angle it should be that's
better

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
better

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:43.660 
better
see<00:01:27.259> if<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.470> was<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> issue<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:43.310> what<00:01:43.520> i'm

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
see if that was the issue so what i'm

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.840 
see if that was the issue so what i'm
going<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:43.850> do<00:01:43.940> is<00:01:44.149> just<00:01:44.720> throw<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.789> since<00:01:46.789> i

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
going to do is just throw it since i

00:01:46.850 --> 00:02:01.359 
going to do is just throw it since i
can't<00:01:47.060> seem<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.270> do<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.509> take-off<00:01:48.440> here

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.190 

the<00:02:01.759> problem<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.210> probably<00:02:02.420> not<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.810> vertical

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the problem is probably not the vertical

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200 
the problem is probably not the vertical

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
you saw how it suddenly turned one

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.130 
you saw how it suddenly turned one
direction<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.519> no<00:02:38.700> idea<00:02:42.620> whoa

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.750 

Richard<00:02:48.010> an<00:02:48.100> anti<00:02:48.310> grass<00:02:48.580> safe<00:02:49.300> thing<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.570> do

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
Richard an anti grass safe thing to do

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.340 
Richard an anti grass safe thing to do
that<00:02:51.760> high<00:02:51.910> grass<00:02:52.150> has<00:02:52.360> saved<00:02:52.600> my<00:02:52.810> plane<00:02:53.080> so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
that high grass has saved my plane so

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.960 
that high grass has saved my plane so
many<00:02:53.560> times<00:02:53.830> I've<00:02:54.340> crashed<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.790> high

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
many times I've crashed in the high

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
many times I've crashed in the high
grass<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.420> I've<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.660> gotten<00:02:55.930> any<00:02:56.170> damage<00:02:56.790> so

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
grass and I've not gotten any damage so

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.940 
grass and I've not gotten any damage so
let's<00:02:58.990> go<00:02:59.230> check<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.530> out

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
let's go check it out

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.850 
let's go check it out
so<00:03:00.910> yeah<00:03:01.150> it's<00:03:01.330> completely<00:03:01.660> unharmed<00:03:01.990> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
so yeah it's completely unharmed the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.510 
so yeah it's completely unharmed the
grass<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.610> high<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:06.370> no

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
grass is like this high so I have no

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.000 
grass is like this high so I have no
idea<00:03:06.790> why<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.060> was<00:03:07.270> going<00:03:07.480> out<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.720> control

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
idea why it was going out of control

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.340 
idea why it was going out of control
it's<00:03:09.010> probably<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:09.460> smart<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.210> keep<00:03:11.080> flying

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
it's probably not smart to keep flying

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.520 
it's probably not smart to keep flying
but<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:12.220> think<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:12.940> will<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.360> mean<00:03:13.990> one<00:03:14.140> theory<00:03:14.470> is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
but I think I will I mean one theory is

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.280 
but I think I will I mean one theory is
there's<00:03:15.340> other<00:03:15.700> radio<00:03:16.150> signals<00:03:16.600> affecting<00:03:17.110> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
there's other radio signals affecting it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:33.360 
there's other radio signals affecting it
it's<00:03:18.070> possibility<00:03:28.230> batteries<00:03:29.230> are<00:03:29.410> gone<00:03:32.370> not

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
it's possibility batteries are gone not

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.070 
it's possibility batteries are gone not
too<00:03:33.520> bad<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.760> yeah<00:03:37.209> when<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.450> batteries<00:03:37.900> go

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
too bad so yeah when the batteries go

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.470 
too bad so yeah when the batteries go
sometimes<00:03:38.560> it's<00:03:39.370> without<00:03:39.580> warning<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.360> you

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
sometimes it's without warning and you

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.760 
sometimes it's without warning and you
know<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.840> you're<00:03:40.990> trying<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.380> something

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
know and you're trying to do something

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.630 
know and you're trying to do something
and<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.070> got<00:03:42.220> no<00:03:42.370> power<00:03:42.550> so<00:03:44.010> but<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.370> don't

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
and you got no power so but I don't

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.010 
and you got no power so but I don't
think<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.790> got<00:03:45.940> any<00:03:46.060> damage<00:03:46.270> let's<00:03:46.570> go<00:03:46.690> check<00:03:46.870> it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
think I got any damage let's go check it

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.020 
think I got any damage let's go check it
out

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.630 

all<00:03:54.030> right<00:03:54.150> no<00:03:54.330> damage<00:03:54.980> kinda<00:03:55.980> hard<00:03:56.159> to<00:03:56.189> steer
