00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:13.172
After ten years without qualifying for a major football 
 championship, Ireland made it to the EuroCup

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:15.026
But the happiness didn’t last long…

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:19.446
The boys in green, as they are known here, have already returned home

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.822
with nine goals conceded, only one goal scored and no points

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:30.097
That’s why E-Dublin and ECM College decided to 
 organize the ECM FIFA EuroCup 2012. 

00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.738
A EuroCup played in the video-game. 

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:35.325
We’ll see now how this is going to work

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:39.746
32 participants signed up on the E-Dublin website. 

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:43.380
The matches were played in pairs at the headquarters of ECM College

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.851
A raffle defined the teams that would be 
 represented by each of the 16 pairs

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:53.101
Just like the real EuroCup in the first 
 phase, each team will play three games

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.101
...and the top eight will qualify for the quarterfinals

00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:58.439
Very well E-Dublin friends

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:03.447
the game is ready to start and Mattheus and Rafael will be representing Ireland!

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:05.060
What are your expectations?

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.200
The expectation is for Ireland to succeed this time, right?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.721
We didn’t do it in the real one but 
 we will make it happen here at ECM...

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:14.378
[Prizes: 1st place - Free Business Certificate]

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.442
Each team has its qualities

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:41.140
like… some teams that are worse than others ...

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.970
For example, Denmark and also Ireland… unfortunately

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.460
I'm an average player, I got a good team,

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:48.140
I'm doing well because of it.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010
We came to enjoy this time with the guys...

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:59.420
get to know the staff and if we win 
 the prize will it be very welcome!

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:01.660
I'm here for four months and ...

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:12.700
I have few more to go but, if I get the 
 prize, I intend to renew my visa for another year

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:19.270
I love living here ... I love the land, people, and 
 places ... so I intend to renew my visa. 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.180
And I've been playing FIFA for a long time. 
 I love playing, I'm a gamer myself ...

00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:35.490
This is the type of event that you can 
 enjoy with everyone... friends, college staff ... 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.810
And although this is only a video game we 
 still end up taking it too seriously, lol

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.760
It is important to see opposing teams as they play ...

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:45.230
Wait for the results from other teams…

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.900
also to check who are you going to play with, who is out…

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:50.690
We're depending on a specific game now

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:52.900
cheering against a team there to see if we can get 
 to the next phase, but it’s going to be difficult

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:54.840
It was really hard!

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:57.860
The first round matches were highly contested

00:02:57.858 --> 00:03:03.490
After a few hours, and 24 balanced matches, there were eight qualified teams

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:18.450
Worse comes to worse it will be qualified but not in first place…

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.270
but maybe a semi-final... let’s do it! 

00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:22.670
The semi-finals have started

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:26.960
and our boys in green, as we would say, are managing to save Ireland

00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.780
We have Ireland, Germany, Czech Republic and Sweden for the semi-finals

00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.680
and you will see the result very soon here on E-Dublin

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:35.690
Keep an eye out!
