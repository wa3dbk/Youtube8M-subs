00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.990
 good afternoon youtube people who must 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.630
 teach them how to clean their packages 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.880
 Like you can see in them the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.870
 second blues are the mercurial light 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.490
 Victor and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.200
 the truth everything is called vÃ­ctor and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.850
 specialty power this the truth is not 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.070
 I'm very sure of what they call themselves 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 that what was invented something not leave 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.050
 for a tone of music so that like 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.590
 more fun the video will not only be 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.000
 talking 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.650
 although it comes up low because then he hears them 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.200
 well the voice is what we are going to play for 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.030
 this to clear them obviously without 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.490
 laces 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.490
 and water 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.820
 soap in this case we are bar for 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.870
 wash hands I do not want a ham not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 to wash clothes that's very good should not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.200
 be off of the whole percent hordijk 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.330
 or it can be any normal cup and a 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.030
 rag that is no longer necessary a rag 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.380
 microfiber and all that what what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.380
 let's do is get wet 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.030
 pure water we went through the package 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.369
 tactical portuguese 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 necessarily up the tongue if it's 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.720
 possible so nothing else a pass we're not going 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.690
 to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 carve not to get rid of it because 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:34.200
 It is the jaguar since it is well pasaditos 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:38.579
 oh clear you have to wash the cloth both 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:45.470
 through we face the soap very well 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.470
 too weird link with a lot of thread 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.470
 with a little wind 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.160
 I do not know what you're not going to leave it that good 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.860
 start equal to the other is this the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.020
 process is not very difficult with 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.149
 be very clean 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.700
 oh clear when they finish put the 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.610
 cards is look at how the bases 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.400
 shoelaces do not simply put them in water 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.720
 and soap 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.629
 I'm also like drying them because I do not 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.799
 only from there I hang them and also 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.019
 what is in line already occupies it and therefore no 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.890
 be and your taquetes please once 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.790
 have the laces 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.810
 has a box in which I'm also going to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.530
 talk but it has a role when the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.110
 Kite 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.730
 complete your packages with a base 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.550
 power if you put the other base Murcia and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.590
 the guards when you 're not going to need what 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.620
 you got in which all good 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.870
 you come back the perfect dirty 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.680
 go back to the same procedure and about 100 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 years to deny what you can 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.740
 Of course 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.640
 had with the package 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.850
 someday how to clean this part of 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.770
 down is different clarified this the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.370
 colors of the matter are not removed 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.620
 they take off that is permanent I 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.140
 I recommend that they submerged use to 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.820
 pastures not for land when the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.830
 sorry ok 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.990
 well this was all I hope you have 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.670
 liked located is my other video how 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.310
 clean the fast ones is almost the same 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.310
 procedure but where fast good 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.310
