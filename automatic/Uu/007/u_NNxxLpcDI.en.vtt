00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.719 
bit more of a steampunk feel than the
actual<00:02:01.109> theory<00:02:02.109> 11<00:02:02.560> steampunks<00:02:03.159> as<00:02:03.340> we<00:02:03.549> take<00:02:03.700> a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
actual theory 11 steampunks as we take a

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.969 
actual theory 11 steampunks as we take a
look<00:02:03.939> at<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.450> look<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.049> theory<00:02:05.619> 11

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
look at the look of the theory 11

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.190 
look at the look of the theory 11
steampunks<00:02:06.579> there<00:02:07.060> 11<00:02:07.450> can<00:02:07.600> make<00:02:07.749> one<00:02:07.959> heck<00:02:08.170> of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
steampunks there 11 can make one heck of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900 
steampunks there 11 can make one heck of
a<00:02:08.350> deck<00:02:08.560> box<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.100> no<00:02:09.220> one<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.580> deny<00:02:09.759> that

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
a deck box and no one can deny that

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.820 
a deck box and no one can deny that
however<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.440> overall<00:02:12.069> look<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:14.140> deck<00:02:14.530> it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
however the overall look of this deck it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.940 
however the overall look of this deck it
just<00:02:15.459> does<00:02:15.850> not<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:17.020> steampunk<00:02:17.620> feel

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
just does not have the steampunk feel

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.980 
just does not have the steampunk feel
that<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.790> actuators<00:02:19.510> comes<00:02:19.780> across

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
that the actuators comes across

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.510 
that the actuators comes across
basically<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.470> looks<00:02:21.710> more<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> machine

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
basically this looks more like a machine

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.660 
basically this looks more like a machine
the<00:02:23.420> back<00:02:23.870> design<00:02:24.200> here<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> generator<00:02:25.070> but

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
the back design here is a generator but

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.670 
the back design here is a generator but
it<00:02:25.790> looks<00:02:25.970> more<00:02:26.240> like<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> machine<00:02:26.780> rather<00:02:27.380> than

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it looks more like a machine rather than

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.950 
it looks more like a machine rather than
these<00:02:28.070> steampunk<00:02:28.640> elements<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.810> is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
these steampunk elements and that is

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.320 
these steampunk elements and that is
through<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.590> back<00:02:30.770> design<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.490> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
through out the back design and the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.580 
through out the back design and the
standard<00:02:32.870> nests<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.140> everything<00:02:33.470> because

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
standard nests of everything because

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.380 
standard nests of everything because
everything's<00:02:34.040> standard<00:02:34.400> except<00:02:34.670> for<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.060> ace

everything's standard except for the ace

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.990 
everything's standard except for the ace

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
of spades and that also doesn't help

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660 
of spades and that also doesn't help
bring<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.690> steampunk<00:02:39.320> feel<00:02:39.590> cross<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.460> just

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
bring that steampunk feel cross it just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.550 
bring that steampunk feel cross it just
overall<00:02:41.030> doesn't<00:02:41.390> mesh<00:02:41.660> together<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.350> theme

actuators<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:49.130> better<00:02:49.520> in<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.970> category<00:02:50.330> now

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
actuators is better in that category now

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.690 
actuators is better in that category now
let's<00:02:51.320> move<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.980> stock<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.460> decks

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
let's move on to the stock of the decks

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.460 
let's move on to the stock of the decks
we'll<00:02:53.510> start<00:02:53.720> off<00:02:53.870> with<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:55.120> actuators<00:02:56.120> as

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
we'll start off with the actuators as

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.840 
we'll start off with the actuators as
you<00:02:57.470> guys<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.800> see<00:02:57.860> there's<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.220> lot<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.400> ink<00:02:58.700> on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
you guys can see there's a lot of ink on

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.700 
you guys can see there's a lot of ink on
these<00:02:58.970> cards<00:02:59.240> so<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.810> stock<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.470> going<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
these cards so the stock is going to

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.650 
these cards so the stock is going to
have<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.830> thinner<00:03:01.130> feel<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.330> on<00:03:02.540> the

account<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.050> there<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.650> more<00:03:04.280> ink<00:03:04.520> on<00:03:04.760> these

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
account that there is more ink on these

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.270 
account that there is more ink on these
cards<00:03:05.810> than<00:03:06.050> normal<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> bicycle

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
cards than normal it's on a bicycle

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520 
cards than normal it's on a bicycle
stock<00:03:07.850> that's<00:03:08.390> able<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.900> handle<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.320> much

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
stock that's able to handle this much

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.530 
stock that's able to handle this much
ink<00:03:09.830> however<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:10.670> still<00:03:10.790> gonna<00:03:11.090> come<00:03:11.420> across

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
ink however it's still gonna come across

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.860 
ink however it's still gonna come across
as<00:03:11.960> a<00:03:12.380> thinner<00:03:12.980> feeling<00:03:13.850> dick<00:03:14.060> moving<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.660> to

the theory 11 steampunk it does have a

the theory 11 steampunk it does have a
thin<00:03:18.050> feel<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:19.520> it<00:03:19.640> has<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.790> slightly

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
thin feel to it but it has a slightly

better<00:03:20.390> quality<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.290> compared<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.190> the

better quality to it compared to the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.180 
better quality to it compared to the
actuators<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.690> because<00:03:24.080> there's<00:03:24.560> less<00:03:24.830> ink

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
actuators just because there's less ink

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.400 
actuators just because there's less ink
and<00:03:25.460> that<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.270> really<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.630> deciding<00:03:27.050> factor

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
and that is really the deciding factor

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.230 
and that is really the deciding factor
in<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.560> stock<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.610> actuators<00:03:29.060> have

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
in the stock is that the actuators have

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.630 
in the stock is that the actuators have
more<00:03:29.510> ink<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.840> them<00:03:29.990> than<00:03:30.320> these<00:03:30.680> theory<00:03:31.310> 11

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640

theory 11 steampunks is best in that
category<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.390> fact<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.810> there's

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
category just on the fact that there's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.230 
category just on the fact that there's
not<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:39.770> much<00:03:39.890> ink<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.400> cards<00:03:40.700> which<00:03:40.880> makes

not as much ink on the cards which makes

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.930 
not as much ink on the cards which makes
the<00:03:41.540> stock<00:03:41.870> just<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.530> tad<00:03:42.800> bit<00:03:43.130> better<00:03:43.370> as<00:03:43.610> we

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the stock just a tad bit better as we

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.690 
the stock just a tad bit better as we
move<00:03:44.150> forward<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:45.140> handling<00:03:45.950> we'll<00:03:46.400> start<00:03:46.610> off

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
move forward to handling we'll start off

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.220 
move forward to handling we'll start off
with<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:46.970> actuators<00:03:47.690> like<00:03:47.840> we've<00:03:47.990> done<00:03:48.110> in

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
with the actuators like we've done in

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.080 
with the actuators like we've done in
every<00:03:48.470> category<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.250> actuators<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.910> good

the theory 11 steampunks takes that

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
doesn't have as much ink so it doesn't

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
the steampunk theme a lot better it

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.620 
the steampunk theme a lot better it
meshes<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.620> together<00:05:15.920> really<00:05:16.280> well<00:05:16.400> with<00:05:17.210> the

meshes it together really well with the

not stand earnest of everything the font
the<00:05:20.600> way<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.870> pips<00:05:21.170> are<00:05:21.350> placed<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.860> even<00:05:22.100> the

the way the pips are placed and even the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.970 
the way the pips are placed and even the
court<00:05:22.400> cards<00:05:22.580> have<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.260> steampunk<00:05:24.260> feel<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.950> it

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
court cards have a steampunk feel to it

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.250 
court cards have a steampunk feel to it
and<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.700> definitely<00:05:25.880> just<00:05:26.090> meshes<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.050> theme

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
and it definitely just meshes the theme

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.590 
and it definitely just meshes the theme
together<00:05:27.440> better<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.430> overall<00:05:28.610> deck<00:05:29.300> as<00:05:29.540> a

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
together better so the overall deck as a

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.310 
together better so the overall deck as a
theme<00:05:30.320> conveyor<00:05:30.830> would<00:05:31.460> be<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:32.450> actuators

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
theme conveyor would be the actuators

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.400 
theme conveyor would be the actuators
has<00:05:33.740> is<00:05:33.980> better<00:05:34.280> in<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.880> category<00:05:35.510> so<00:05:36.050> thank
