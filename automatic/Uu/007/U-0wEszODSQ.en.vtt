00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.810
 No 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.970
 four months have been since the first idea 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.220
 past 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.770
 It is time for a decision 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.450
 to grasp the management and the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.160
 department heads will be the driver 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.160
 concept once again presented 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 Such a machine looks like 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.820
 our own investigations 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.379
 We assume, however, first of all 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.900
 West Germany consider that we are the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.489
 potential of around 500,000 hectares 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.659
 if we assume that ten 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.299
 percent of the space above salaries 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.670
 Participants are processed by the x 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.350
 markets of Western Europe and also with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.909
 professional operated in the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.060
 eastern part of europe think so 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.799
 justifies that is the basis for it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.049
 that there is a serial production 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.580
 could we have herforst the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.770
 spatial possibilities for the construction 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.500
 such a prototype and also later 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.790
 the following quantities because even the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.960
 be much bigger than what we do 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.149
 have built so far 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.969
 I assume that we are an area 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.710
 of about 20 x 20 m 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.780
 I would try it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.689
 there shifts the emporia free 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.390
 and the serial parts then issue more beautiful 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.299
 material and then down there then 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.939
 Do it yourself 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.630
 To what extent is the project already? 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.429
 budgeted for the year 2003 we have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.840
 this prototype construction show with 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.310
 We have considered the technology 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.170
 the budget will be addressed 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 addressed the customers 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.740
 I think that's the requirement around 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.880
 now make the decision that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.690
 we build these products 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.690
 let's start 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 yes, since we all are for the project 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.180
 have decided and we agree so nicely 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.180
 i would say hello
