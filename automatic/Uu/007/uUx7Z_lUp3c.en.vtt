00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.209
 the school is a place where the students 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.500
 they spend a lot of their time 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.219
 that precautions must be taken 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.599
 to avoid accidents in it the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.790
 Boys and girls being on the stage 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.189
 of the novel recreation but one 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.079
 mischief a destiny like shoves 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.720
 has a staircase windows or doors 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.230
 very closed were unleashing in a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230
 accident 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 with Jorge first squad officer 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 of the school morelos or better than 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.980
 we could expect a little about the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 work they do here in the center 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 Morelos school about the prevention of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.430
 accidents good in terms of prevention 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 I believe that what is done 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 Primarily it is like signs of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.769
 emergency exits the route the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.329
 case in the case of drills and 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.250
 conditions let's go into the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.979
 description we have to be all the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 marked lines we have our circle 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:06.840
 of security and good the book the school 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.060

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.549
 group information 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.680
 but merely that is what the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.450
 prevention what is your main job 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.799
 here at the school good 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.469
 Unfortunately my work 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.909
 prevention 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.880
 when it happens some 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.939
 some mishap some student of the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.939
 institution 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.340
 a decision 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.290
 the mishap in a merida trauma a 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.670
 fracture we are going to act in such a way 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.100
 way of what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.350
 recover or individual case save your 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.659
 life and even of those who prepare us 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.840
 prepare to face these 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.840
 problems 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.729
 the alumni who passed through 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.729
 do not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.190
 but also the part of the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.190
 physiotherapists 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.300
 why 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.980
 and finally of any suggestion that you 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.200
 you can give us what to do in case of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.569
 the school 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.760
 for example 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.420
 again it is sometimes easier to handle 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 the orders 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:35.540
 us how to call the person more 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:43.340
 trained then in this case 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:45.230
 we train the same does not have the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780
 morelos school center we can see that 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.820
 there are people who are trained and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.220
 which are the same students that we 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.770
 support to prevent the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.510
 accidents and if not already arise 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.160
 accidents know what to do in case of 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.160
 this one thank you very much 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.980
 i 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.819
 in the middle of the school day 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.830
 explanations that can turn you 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.290
 delicate that springs to me that should 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.209
 analyze yourself from rim convention we talk about 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.549
 the school acquirers the two 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.140
 first to which no student doubts 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.330
 behaviors on the part of 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.790
 students and a complete prevention 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.980
 by the 18 teachers for 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.750
 rent and student school not 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.200
 have a problem during the year 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.200
 dresses 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.410
 the schoolchildren of civil protection 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.310
 circular 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.560
 and others in relation to the focus is 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.959
 conventional is entity we have a 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.219
 prefect of discipline that normally 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.219
 he is sitting in the entrance 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.489
 and we have a record book in the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.220
 which all the people who enter 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.150
 the institution with the reason why 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.150
 they come after 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.659
 the duration that remains in it 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.469
 then we have some areas in the 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.469
 which you 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Y 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.620
 with the purpose of 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.220
 prevent bullying 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.969
 that teachers have their topics 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.069
 adequately 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.729
 and we also have in the courtyards to see 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.729
 the young woman is 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.480
 because it serves not possible 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.280
 some people outside 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.280
 come in and you want to take some 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.349
 you have to be careful with the mess to 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.999
 the entrance and exit of the school since 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.610
 accidents can occur that 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:06.610
 generate asphyxia fainting among others 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.320
 It is important to indicate that the 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.139
 students 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:49.030
 the return journey may cause 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.030
 muscle injuries 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.480
 It is important that in each classroom 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.610
 classes have a first-aid kit on hand 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.300
 the basic food to provide the 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.300
 first files 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.419
 remember and respect the rules of 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.759
 behavior of your school if you respect 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.220
 to your colleagues and avoid aggressions 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.259
 physical and if it prevents situations that 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.810
 can affect others have a 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.680
 quiet school season with friends and 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.680
