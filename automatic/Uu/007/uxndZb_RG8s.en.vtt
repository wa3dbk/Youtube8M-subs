00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:16.280
 now let's take a look at the number 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.280
 350 wind is an example 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 around 350 kilometers per hour 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.579
 You walk a football field for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.710
 second, I imagine there is a beam 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.070
 until the other you go through that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.129
 travel in less than one second 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.079
 impressive in this issue is that it is a 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.329
 challenge the daring of machines and pilots 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.519
 together they carry our 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.079
 imagination to the magical world and even 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.820
 possible within a reality offer 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.670
 the feeling is that it seems that the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.149
 car arriving at the bend the car arrives 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.710
 faster than the sound the feeling of 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.719
 speed is much higher you come from 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.850
 out there you think and I can 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.119
 technology developed to achieve the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 the 350 mark for the time being depends a 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:15.640
 motor power and there are another 350 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.399
 350 to dump the horsepower 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.369
 engine needs to have a fairly 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.830
 sturdy famous v8 here for 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.619
 mansell american house falls very well 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.619
 here you see a luxury sv like this 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.939
 350 horses a car of 2.3 tons and 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:41.979
 can make in 7.4 seconds zero to one hundred 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.840
 the constant motion proposal begins 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.789
 by design than 7 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.310
 the continuous surfaces give a visual 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.950
 take to a vehicle so long 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.469
 it also has room for seven people and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.750
 a representative of the most important 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.990
 luxurious and modern utilities 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.459
 and when the number came here 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.729
 in the name of the car 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:11.470
 in the case of mercedes it is 350 the number is 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.750
 connected to the 3.5 v6 engine layout is a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.599
 the machines that make the entire line joe 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.670
 is one of the great successes of the company will 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.440
 from 0 to 100 per hour in less than eight 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.440
 seconds in absolute silence 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.250
 the sales director in brazil explains 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.650
 that the company's tradition flexes 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.599
 the higher the number the power of the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.640
 engine which means having a vehicle 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.079
 faster but more enjoyable to drive 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.079
 something serious work 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.630
 for those who want faster answers and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.170
 a bit more of the engine sound 350g still 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.170
 it is a reference 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.849
 the 350z has long been one of the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.959
 most coveted models for those who like 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.360
 sports 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:06.060
 but as everything evolves he now responds 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:10.560
 by another name 370z to celebrate the 40 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.590
 years of the z- line 370 people who the 350 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.170
 had good aerodynamic design with 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.760
 charm of the lanterns game 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.549
 the body has gained lighter materials 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.549
 and the wheelbase decreased 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.970
 we have a lot more than 350 reasons 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.549
 to tell other stories 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.549
 but this is for the next programs 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.200
 Good Sunday, bye.
