that's<00:00:29.859> another<00:00:30.189> question

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
that's another question

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.330 
that's another question
when<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.760> sell

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340

when they sell
there<00:00:34.730> may<00:00:34.820> not<00:00:34.880> be<00:00:35.000> anything<00:00:35.240> class

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
there may not be anything class

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.540 
there may not be anything class
and<00:00:37.080> increasingly<00:00:37.380> that's<00:00:37.920> what's<00:00:38.130> happening

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and increasingly that's what's happening

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.480 
and increasingly that's what's happening
in<00:00:38.670> California<00:00:39.210> people<00:00:39.390> are

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 
in California people are

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.810 
in California people are
there's<00:00:42.090> no<00:00:42.210> equity<00:00:42.600> left<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.930> their<00:00:43.050> homes

three<00:00:50.690> years<00:00:50.900> ago<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:51.320> 450<00:00:51.950> are<00:00:52.040> now<00:00:52.190> going

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
three years ago for 450 are now going

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.560 
three years ago for 450 are now going
for<00:00:52.670> 150

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
for 150

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.910 
for 150
so<00:00:53.840> they've<00:00:53.960> dropped<00:00:54.170> two<00:00:54.410> thirds<00:00:54.650> of<00:00:54.770> their

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
so they've dropped two thirds of their

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160 
so they've dropped two thirds of their
value<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:56.300> problem<00:00:56.630> in<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.750> place<00:00:56.930> like<00:00:57.050> that

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
value the problem in a place like that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.470 
value the problem in a place like that
is<00:00:57.620> most<00:00:58.400> of<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.579> people<00:00:58.850> make<00:00:58.970> ten<00:00:59.180> or<00:00:59.270> twelve

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
is most of the people make ten or twelve

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.120 
is most of the people make ten or twelve
dollars<00:00:59.750> an<00:00:59.870> hour<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:00.260> can<00:01:00.410> or<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:01.100> can't

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
dollars an hour you can or you can't

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.790 
dollars an hour you can or you can't
even<00:01:01.580> qualify<00:01:01.970> for<00:01:02.210> 150

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.710 

maybe<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.730> couple<00:01:06.970> could<00:01:07.300> I<00:01:07.330> don't<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.690> don't

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
maybe a couple could I don't I don't

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.050 
maybe a couple could I don't I don't
know<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.050> might<00:01:08.080> be<00:01:08.230> love

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.969 

that's<00:01:13.479> your<00:01:14.079> payment<00:01:14.439> on<00:01:14.530> that's<00:01:14.740> going<00:01:14.860> to

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
that's your payment on that's going to

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.020 
that's your payment on that's going to
be<00:01:15.100> fairly<00:01:15.460> less<00:01:16.180> than<00:01:16.329> that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.969 

but<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.869> other<00:01:20.020> clincher<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.590> how<00:01:20.710> much<00:01:20.860> the

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
but the other clincher is how much the

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.680 
but the other clincher is how much the
down<00:01:21.159> payment<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.760> can<00:01:21.909> spend<00:01:22.119> making<00:01:22.240> $12

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
down payment so you can spend making $12

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.440 
down payment so you can spend making $12
now<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:22.900> probably<00:01:23.170> can't<00:01:23.470> make<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:24.330> twenty<00:01:25.330> or

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
now I probably can't make it twenty or

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.300 
now I probably can't make it twenty or
twenty-five<00:01:25.720> thousand<00:01:26.260> dollar<00:01:26.440> down<00:01:26.860> payment

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
twenty-five thousand dollar down payment

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.200 
twenty-five thousand dollar down payment
that's<00:01:27.520> pretty<00:01:27.909> unlikely

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.340 

rare<00:01:34.750> for<00:01:35.140> people

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
rare for people

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
rare for people
tell<00:01:37.100> their<00:01:37.340> full

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
you're if you're all sutton staring in

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.160 
you're if you're all sutton staring in
the<00:01:46.320> face<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.270> house<00:01:48.479> may<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.990> go

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the face that that your house may not go

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.529 
the face that that your house may not go
up<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:49.469> where<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.240> 2007<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.390> another

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
up to where it was in 2007 for another

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.000 
up to where it was in 2007 for another
15<00:01:52.049> years

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.950 

that<00:01:55.700> causes<00:01:56.150> people<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.480> really<00:01:56.780> rethink

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that causes people to really rethink

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.750 
that causes people to really rethink
what<00:01:57.350> they're<00:01:57.500> doing

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
what they're doing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:07.969 
what they're doing
no<00:01:59.330> what<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.570> mean<00:01:59.840> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.520 

at<00:02:08.979> night

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.670 

you<00:02:11.800> know<00:02:11.860> that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.580 

that's<00:02:16.280> why

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.710 

but<00:02:20.129> his<00:02:20.280> best<00:02:20.489> yet

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
but his best yet

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.460 
but his best yet
his<00:02:22.290> problem<00:02:22.800> yeah<00:02:24.050> well<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.230> was<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
his problem yeah well that was the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.900 
his problem yeah well that was the
rationale<00:02:25.890> behind<00:02:27.590> any<00:02:28.590> border<00:02:28.950> 400,000<00:02:29.760> less

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
rationale behind any border 400,000 less

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.600 
rationale behind any border 400,000 less
than

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:42.220 

but<00:02:33.240> his<00:02:33.660> mistake<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.260> he<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.130> too<00:02:35.310> old

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.790 

you<00:02:42.709> see<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:44.200> nasty<00:02:45.200> nasty

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
you see that's a that's a nasty nasty
