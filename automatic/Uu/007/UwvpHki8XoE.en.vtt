00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 mugs can be different 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.410
 Here is this foam and which are sold 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.800
 correct model not only culture 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.800
 suede 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.520
 the circle weighs 38 facets from the sky easily drags 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:35.300
 zhivetski wind blown up 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:38.190
 goes the upper layers and is supervised fishing line 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:44.150
 here had to cut. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.150
 it was a not nick cool like that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:59.300
 further went streaming only circle 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:03.559
 square coil bolt for weighting and 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 love spell important big clearly visible 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:13.110
 Unfortunately, this flag does not give 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.470
 turn the bait jerk that is, you need 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.470
 traction 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.500
 so that the fishing line did not cut the foam 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.380
 here I filled it with glue and dp.ru is good 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.170
 working 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:37.979
 Well, the dark color did not go well further 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:44.219
 wooden circles and she carries a circle 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 we weigh seventy one gram of it 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:55.619
 cups weight 157 grams per hand are used to 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.090
 In order to pass through it the fishing line and 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.329
 bite night 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:06.010
 the fishing line turns over 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:10.240
 as usual there is no antenna on this cup 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.480
 and therefore if up to a bush the descent is small 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.490
 then can shed so the fishing line pulls in 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.760
 side of the circle spins 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:26.530
 fishing line emits and does not roll over on 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.930
 a trace of the moment did the antenna out 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.330
 the fishing line is reeled on 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 through the gutters is still missing 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.950
 white side groove 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.900
 the same circle but a little less 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:50.320
 diameter like this we have here 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:53.740
 Now we weigh it 215 grams so already 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.220
 slightly smaller in diameter and slightly smaller 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.220
 below 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.940
 working for a little worse is the best of 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.940
 the fact that having to date 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.519
 shine passes through the groove 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.519
 U-turn 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.519
 all is ready 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.440
 on the whip turn the fishing line 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:44.840
 everything is reset fine such a circle 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:49.950
 held a sprout example for 120 grams 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:56.220
 There are no empty coups 200 grams 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:00.379
 easy to turn over and pike somewhere 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.379
 kilogram liberty doctors too 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.739
 fixed with a rubber band
