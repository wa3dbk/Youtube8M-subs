00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
of the cloth and cut so that it's just a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.229 
of the cloth and cut so that it's just a
touch<00:00:56.190> bigger<00:00:57.020> than<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.199> actual<00:00:58.850> base<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
touch bigger than your actual base and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.979 
touch bigger than your actual base and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
strips and I'm going to guess that you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.840 
strips and I'm going to guess that you
need<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.119> 20<00:01:06.720> strips<00:01:07.110> per<00:01:08.010> vase<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.640> I'm

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
need about 20 strips per vase and I'm

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
need about 20 strips per vase and I'm
just<00:01:09.060> cutting<00:01:09.240> these<00:01:09.770> O'Riley<00:01:10.770> half<00:01:10.979> inch<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
just cutting these O'Riley half inch to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.929 
just cutting these O'Riley half inch to
a<00:01:12.060> quarter<00:01:12.540> inch<00:01:12.869> wide<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:14.460> doesn't<00:01:14.790> matter

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
a quarter inch wide it doesn't matter

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570 
a quarter inch wide it doesn't matter
the<00:01:15.150> more<00:01:15.299> variety<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.170> interesting<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the more variety the more interesting it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.100 
the more variety the more interesting it
will<00:01:17.790> look<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> put<00:01:18.630> them<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.840> together

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.899 

now<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> use<00:01:22.409> plaster<00:01:23.220> cloth<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.759> you're

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
now to use plaster cloth all you're

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
now to use plaster cloth all you're
going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.659> dip<00:01:25.320> each<00:01:25.740> strip<00:01:26.780> into<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
going to do is dip each strip into a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
going to do is dip each strip into a
little<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> water<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> almost

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
little bit of water and this is almost

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
little bit of water and this is almost
like<00:01:31.229> paper<00:01:31.710> mache<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.000> lay

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
like paper mache and then you just lay

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.030 
like paper mache and then you just lay
them<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.470> side<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:35.130> your<00:01:35.670> glass<00:01:35.939> space

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
them down the side of your glass space

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
them down the side of your glass space
like<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.570> keep<00:01:39.750> putting

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
like so and you can just keep putting

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
like so and you can just keep putting
them<00:01:41.060> next<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:43.110> each<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:44.220> just

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
them next to each other and you're just

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.069 
them next to each other and you're just
going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> smooth<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
going to smooth them out as you go and

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
going to smooth them out as you go and
then<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> corners<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
then for the corners you kind of want to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.590 
then for the corners you kind of want to
choose<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.170> piece<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.220> cloth<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.420> little

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
choose a piece of cloth that's a little

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.389 
choose a piece of cloth that's a little
bit<00:01:54.780> wider<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.040> here

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
bit wider like this one I have here

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.249 
bit wider like this one I have here
because<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> lay<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> right<00:01:58.049> over

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
because you can just lay it right over

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.440 
because you can just lay it right over
the<00:01:58.350> corner<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> squish

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the corner and then just kind of squish

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.319 
the corner and then just kind of squish
it<00:02:00.479> around<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.079> sides<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.210> then

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
it around the sides like that and then

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
it around the sides like that and then
what<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.049> keep<00:02:04.380> going

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
what you would do is just keep going

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.109 
what you would do is just keep going
around<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.610> entire<00:02:06.360> vase<00:02:07.229> form<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.119> then

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
around the entire vase form and then

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
around the entire vase form and then
you'll<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.599> something<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.319> this

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
you'll have something like this

I've been using it to mix I'm just gonna

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.900 
I've been using it to mix I'm just gonna
grab<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.160> new<00:04:35.430> sponge<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:37.310> pick<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.460> some<00:04:38.700> paint

and now I can start adding some texture
to<00:04:41.720> my<00:04:42.720> tree<00:04:42.990> trunk<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:45.090> doesn't<00:04:45.480> take

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
to my tree trunk and it doesn't take

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.590 
to my tree trunk and it doesn't take
much<00:04:45.690> paint<00:04:46.260> on<00:04:46.410> your<00:04:47.280> sponge<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.940> create<00:04:48.330> all

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
entirely coated now we're going to put a

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.350 
entirely coated now we're going to put a
nice<00:05:15.360> glaze<00:05:15.900> over<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:17.400> whole<00:05:17.730> thing<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.180> make

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
it really shiny and even though this

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.680 
it really shiny and even though this
glue<00:05:20.970> looks<00:05:21.330> blue<00:05:22.250> when<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.490> paint<00:05:23.820> or<00:05:24.390> when

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
glue looks blue when you paint or when

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.750 
glue looks blue when you paint or when
you<00:05:24.780> when<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.200> see<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.530> when<00:05:25.950> you<00:05:26.070> paint<00:05:26.400> it<00:05:26.580> it

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you when you see it when you paint it it

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.210 
you when you see it when you paint it it
actually<00:05:27.000> looks<00:05:27.480> clear<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.770> make<00:05:29.040> your

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
actually looks clear so to make your

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.320 
actually looks clear so to make your
vase<00:05:29.430> shiny<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:30.600> can<00:05:30.810> just<00:05:30.990> add<00:05:31.200> a<00:05:31.230> layer<00:05:31.530> of

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
vase shiny you can just add a layer of

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.130 
vase shiny you can just add a layer of
this<00:05:33.330> glue<00:05:34.230> and<00:05:35.150> then<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.420> almost<00:05:36.780> makes<00:05:37.020> it

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
this glue and then that almost makes it

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.420 
this glue and then that almost makes it
look<00:05:37.320> like<00:05:37.530> glass<00:05:37.830> and<00:05:40.310> that<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:44.160> how<00:05:44.340> you

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
look like glass and that it's how you

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.750 
look like glass and that it's how you
make<00:05:44.760> a<00:05:45.030> tree<00:05:46.020> trunk<00:05:46.260> vase<00:05:46.560> now<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:47.340> fill<00:05:47.580> your

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
make a tree trunk vase now to fill your

make a tree trunk vase now to fill your
vase<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.000> just<00:05:48.420> go<00:05:48.600> out<00:05:48.810> into<00:05:49.050> your<00:05:49.140> backyard

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
and it's probably a good idea to ask

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.290 
and it's probably a good idea to ask
permission<00:05:52.620> before<00:05:52.920> you<00:05:53.400> start<00:05:53.670> cutting<00:05:53.910> on
