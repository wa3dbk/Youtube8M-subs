trainer switch but anyway just get over

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
trainer switch but anyway just get over
to<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> set<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:10.460> left<00:01:17.659> okay<00:01:18.659> I'm

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to where you set up your I left okay I'm

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.250 
to where you set up your I left okay I'm
going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> radio<00:01:24.080> throttle<00:01:25.080> curbs

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.670 

heck<00:01:31.260> I<00:01:34.580> guess<00:01:35.580> that's<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.680> I'm

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
heck I guess that's what I'm

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.870 
heck I guess that's what I'm
understanding<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.550> know<00:01:38.700> they're

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
understanding is I don't know they're

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.000 
understanding is I don't know they're
like<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.830> then<00:01:42.410> because<00:01:43.410> I'm<00:01:43.530> running

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
like that and then because I'm running

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.710 
like that and then because I'm running
governor<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.760> here<00:01:44.940> so<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.240> why<00:01:45.360> my<00:01:45.510> pitch

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
governor on here so that's why my pitch

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.040 
governor on here so that's why my pitch
curve<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.320> night<00:01:52.760> okay<00:01:53.760> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.480> normal

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.700 

I<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:41.110> tell<00:02:41.350> by<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.590> buddy<00:02:42.250> troubles<00:02:43.470> fa<00:02:44.470> gee

I can tell by my buddy troubles fa gee

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.410 
I can tell by my buddy troubles fa gee
it<00:02:44.920> looks<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.520> gonna<00:02:45.700> have<00:02:45.790> some<00:02:46.180> fun

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
it looks like I'm gonna have some fun

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.900 
it looks like I'm gonna have some fun
when<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.750> when<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.470> switch<00:02:48.040> over<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.430> radio

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
when I when I switch over to that radio

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.750 
when I when I switch over to that radio
I<00:02:48.940> have<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.270> learn<00:02:49.450> all<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.720> new<00:02:49.960> programming

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
I have to learn all the new programming

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.100 
I have to learn all the new programming
but<00:02:51.760> since<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.240> know<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:52.630> one<00:02:52.780> pretty<00:02:52.990> well

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
but since I know this one pretty well

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.990 
but since I know this one pretty well
hopefully<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.860> won't<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.160> done<00:02:54.400> hard<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:54.970> I

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
hopefully it won't be done hard but I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.660 
hopefully it won't be done hard but I
doubt<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:57.390> okay<00:02:59.400> now<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:00.790> your<00:03:05.670> normal

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
doubt it okay now this is your normal

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.310 
doubt it okay now this is your normal
mold<00:03:07.060> pitch<00:03:07.420> curve<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:10.810> turn<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.260> knob

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
mold pitch curve then you turn this knob

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.860 
mold pitch curve then you turn this knob
to<00:03:12.160> either<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:12.880> set<00:03:13.270> your<00:03:13.450> idle<00:03:13.690> one

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
to either one you set your idle one

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
to either one you set your idle one
pitch<00:03:14.140> curves<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.800> then<00:03:27.100> here<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.950> then<00:03:34.890> you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
pitch curves and then here and then you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.550 
pitch curves and then here and then you
go<00:03:36.070> up<00:03:36.100> there<00:03:36.520> turn<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.180> knob<00:03:37.420> go<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.550> idle<00:03:39.550> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
go up there turn this knob go to idle to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.720 
go up there turn this knob go to idle to
set<00:03:41.560> your<00:03:41.709> I'll<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.160> pitch<00:03:42.370> curves<00:03:44.190> by<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.250> one

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
set your I'll to pitch curves by the one

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.430 
set your I'll to pitch curves by the one
and<00:03:45.760> idle<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.360> pitch<00:03:46.600> curbs<00:03:46.989> are<00:03:47.140> both<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
and idle to pitch curbs are both the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.740 
and idle to pitch curbs are both the
same<00:03:47.709> only<00:03:48.640> thing<00:03:49.090> my<00:03:50.970> normal<00:03:51.970> curves<00:03:52.450> are

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
same only thing my normal curves are

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.259 
same only thing my normal curves are
different<00:03:53.430> but<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.459> got<00:03:54.670> different<00:03:54.880> head

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
different but I got different head

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.390 
different but I got different head
speeds<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.140> different<00:03:56.410> dual<00:03:56.800> rates<00:03:57.070> on

different<00:03:57.790> idle<00:03:58.120> up<00:03:58.239> settings<00:03:58.800> now<00:03:59.800> this<00:04:00.130> one

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
different idle up settings now this one

curbs you only have throttle hold pitch

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.510 
curbs you only have throttle hold pitch
curbs<00:04:25.120> so<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.169> go<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:26.770> there<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:26.979> in<00:04:27.250> your

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
curbs so you go in there and in your

pitch<00:04:27.760> curves<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.540> go<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.100> H<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:31.479> way

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.719 
pitch curves and you go to H that way
you<00:04:31.720> can<00:04:31.960> set<00:04:32.200> up<00:04:32.350> pitch<00:04:32.740> curves<00:04:33.130> where<00:04:33.580> your

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
you can set up pitch curves where your

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.860 
you can set up pitch curves where your
throttle<00:04:34.210> hold

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.610 

one<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:41.050> them<00:04:41.260> picked<00:04:41.560> me<00:04:41.740> -<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:46.630> should<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:46.960> 50

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
one of them picked me - it should be 50

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.230 
one of them picked me - it should be 50
huh

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.409 

okay<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.910> then<00:04:58.550> go<00:04:59.550> back<00:04:59.819> up<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:02.000> either<00:05:03.000> one

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
okay and then go back up to either one

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.460 
okay and then go back up to either one

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.740 

don't<00:06:13.830> use<00:06:14.039> my<00:06:14.280> pitch<00:06:15.060> curve<00:06:15.389> that<00:06:15.659> our

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
don't use my pitch curve that our

don't use my pitch curve that our

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.689 
problem with my linkage is I have to
store<00:06:17.819> it<00:06:17.849> out<00:06:20.509> okay<00:06:21.620> but<00:06:22.620> anyway<00:06:22.979> you'll<00:06:23.370> use

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
store it out okay but anyway you'll use

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:30.230 
store it out okay but anyway you'll use
linear<00:06:24.150> from<00:06:24.539> 0<00:06:25.460> to<00:06:26.599> 100<00:06:27.599> 0<00:06:27.840> 25<00:06:28.349> 50<00:06:29.280> 75<00:06:29.310> and<00:06:29.909> 100
