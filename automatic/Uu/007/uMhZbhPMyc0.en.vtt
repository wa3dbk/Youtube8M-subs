00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.019
 to build a building labeled as low energy building 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.849
 that is, who consume on average 50 kilowatt hours per square meter per 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.309
 promoters now incorporate new standards into their programs 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.520
 real estate 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.220
 that's why some people had already started this process with the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.040
 certification habitat and environment it is now reinforced with the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.350
 bbc label 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 for example a building bbc consumes three times less energy 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.790
 than new construction and six times less than a building 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.160
 in the 70s 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.100
 from the design of a housing bbc everything is optimized to perform 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.360
 real savings of energy I propose you to discover now 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.950
 some examples 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.520
 to reach the average of 50 kilowatt hours per square meter and per 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.290
 year 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.739
 everything counts 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.739
 building side insulation is one of the keys of the bbc label 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.910
 however it is also important to choose bronzes equipments and 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.910
 to adopt green gestures to reduce its energy bill 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.480
 take the case of a detached house 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.890
 its orientation makes it possible to make the most of solar gains 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.680
 inner and outer insulation is optimized to limit wastage 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.420
 energy 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140
 in the case of our house the walls are going out to favor the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.480
 thermal inertia 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.940
 side balconies or windows shutters drop down and more generally all 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 the openings 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.430
 the insulation is reinforced to reduce thermal losses in winter and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 bring a better comfort in summer 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.149
 inside a new generation boiler was installed as well 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.380
 a thrifty balloon and a water recuperator 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.460
 for lighting the installation of presence detectors associated with 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.870
 low energy bulbs also save money 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.800
 as you can see that we know housing bbc and demand 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.850
 the intervention of many trades 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.600
 excellent coordination to achieve this average of 50 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.229
 kilowatt hours per square meter per year 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.429
 this energy standard will be mandatory from 2013 but 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.329
 some promoters are now committed to this approach 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.709
 eco-citizen then inquire before buying especially as these 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.709
 tax incentives for new real estate bbc 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.239
 offers many benefits now 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.560
 benefits that you discover in the video and savings of a 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.949
 housing bbc
