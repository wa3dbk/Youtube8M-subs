Walmart targets and support here and
there<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.079> believe<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> support

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
like four times and the reason for that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940 
like four times and the reason for that
is<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.239> one<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.750> too<00:00:43.260> expensive<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
is because one it's too expensive and I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.560 
is because one it's too expensive and I
really<00:00:44.250> don't<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> spend<00:00:45.030> my<00:00:45.210> money<00:00:45.329> on
