00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
 very good kids today I do the fifa of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.660
 that I bring you a new video in this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.090
 case I bring you a new suit since 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.849
 the 232 that have been very successful 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 a lot of support and in this case I bring you a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.349
 fret that is very simple to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.170
 people with few coins we 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.290
 to aim for gold quality and maximum price 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.530
 300 bidding and it's very simple let's go 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 bidding for all players 550 in 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 baskets for players who have stockings 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.769
 higher for example as handanovic 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.409
 as you have seen we are looking for 600 we are going to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.140
 pay 550 and 600 for example by sneijder 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:56.479
 we bid 600 that has half rise already 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.860
 I joined the defense because we look for 550 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.839
 1550 and we're also going to do that 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.839
 only with the unique gold players 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.160
 what are we going to achieve with this good 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.050
 let's take these players for a 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.640
 price still lower than the one 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.370
 we get when we discard it the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.050
 failure of the people who put it like this 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.650
 that we're going to keep pushing for this and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.230
 for 550 for example 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.170
 this center that is from the tip has 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.990
 very little rhythm 550 nkoulou central web 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.460
 that has 1080 we bid 600 change 550 and 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.630
 Well, let's continue with this 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.490
 process 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.150
 some of us will take them because we do not know 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.159
 They will advance in the bidding but we know 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.740
 in that procedure with 2 550 also 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.890
 and nothing then let's continue like this all the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.679
 Wait a little while until we get some 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.829
 how many players by 550 or by 600 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.350
 Coins may be that at the beginning 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.079
 of the territory we leave but finally 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.409
 you will take some to the best of 10 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.319
 players you have 5 but other times 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.080
 of 18 depends on what it takes now 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.269
 maximum that I have put that the bundes with 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.459
 five stars of watermarks is 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.129
 pretty good has one is pretty 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.829
 acceptable and good there you see that we're going 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.430
 to take to wakaso 250 howard mann overcomes 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.650
 The push 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.569
 we eliminate it from the market objective 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.400
 gervinho equal 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.599
 you see us also that we have called 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.569
 we have taken a muse that is a 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.180
 been tremendous with 93 the pace that I think 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.969
 who is 93 and a very good player and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.110
 let's get a game that player 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:46.600
 that we have taken for 550 coins 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.720
 and there you see, since we 've taken everything 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.250
 will start with discard or put in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.660
 sale the transferable players for 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.240
 take out the profit boetti with a player 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.790
 it does not have to be but being of 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.400
 country of extreme left in the league 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.560
 Dutch, I do not think it's worth much 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.170
 anyway if you want to get a 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.050
 you put the biggest party for 650 like me 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.320
 I will be here 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.260
 and once you put it for 650 and 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.860
 always remember to put initial project 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.860
 50 less of him 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.510
 from purchase already because if they are going to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.879
 push and they will take it cheaper 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.819
 in place a good central we are going to put 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.579
 for a higher price and let's take out 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.260
 an even greater prophet put concentrate 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.690
 with 80 rhythm 81 defense 77 of physique 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.480
 very good nkoulou try it what 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.540
 proved incredibly well let's put by 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.160
 900 an hour we always continue with 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.140
 campbell that a md that does not 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.780
 we are not going to take much away so 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.160
 I discard it directly faster than 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.170
 guzmÃ¡n that is an event that either 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.300
 it's really worth it so what 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.370
 we also discard 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.920
 and well, we are going to go by removing 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.260
 to the players that we have achieved by 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.540
 about 100 discarding it by putting it to 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.670
 sell if we can get more out of it 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.640
 and you see the players that they in this 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.370
 case I have put to sell we have 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.560
 sold to willem by 1200 now volts 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.560
 for 900 and nkoulou for 1100 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.039
 music and muse we have sold it too 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.460
 per thousand so nothing kids this has 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:31.960
 been the third trade or channel that is 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.729
 for people who have less coins or 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.740
 they also get a smaller profit than the one 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:42.190
 get out with the other two traders but 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.289
 this will always be 100% safe and 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.240
 super reliable you are not going to lose coins 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.680
 never because bidding for 150 and 600 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.449
 always although the discards that is by 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.520
 the least I'm going to get out I'm going to take you out 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.639
 of 600 up so they're never going to 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.759
 lose coins with this trade or 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.710
 and remember always remember to stop a 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.800
 laical video subscribe to the channel to 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.629
 more videos leave a lot of support for this 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.939
 video like the other two deals I've 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.639
 uploaded and that and I'll keep going up more expensive 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.439
 of you and nothing kids and comments for 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.550
 any doubt and until the next we 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.550
