00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.550
 hi to all the welcome back boys 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.619
 with ceri boh after that short video on the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.500
 hard disk 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.699
 let's see the unit of today 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.890
 central processing of ours 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:30.589
 computer that is more inside also the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.140
 processor what the cpi is the gpu to point 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:36.440
 central processing unit is that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.510
 component that precisely has the task of 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.940
 execute program instructions 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.760
 present in the new central or primary 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.379
 that is the ram and after having taken it 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.590
 precisely from the secondary memory that is 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.530
 the hard disk during the execution 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.850
 of the program c more reads or writes data 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.649
 in the central memory that is precisely the ram 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.800
 and therefore has the task of elaborating 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.329
 all the data obviously being a gpu 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.480
 more powerful and lips faster 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.180
 data so computer is faster 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.950
 let's go straight to this 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.940
 processor in this case we have a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.730
 intel i5 third generation then ivy 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.730
 bridge with unlocked multiplier 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.580
 that is, times I will explain all this 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.580
 means unlocked multiplier 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:38.210
 so here you see that this indeed 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:40.399
 a5 3570 k pump precisely pump 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.470
 dot the word k in the end means 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:49.030
 that fs b is the frequency 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.619
 minimum at which the professor turns 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.619
 is unlocked to be unlocked for a 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.220
 higher quantum then can be 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.590
 therefore we can increase in the hurts 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.200
 of the cpi 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.759
 said in words very very poor from 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.950
 through the bios of the motherboard 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.940
 we can go to edit point fs 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.930
 ii which would be the multiplier of the dl 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.120
 of minimum hurts and up to inter 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.400
 you will come to increase them precisely 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.019
 this for example now basic and turns 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.959
 at what turns at 3.4 gigahertz we can 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.079
 increase for example to 4.5 gb per 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.900
 example however obviously greater will be the 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.840
 load and higher must be the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:45.200
 cooling in fact more operations 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.239
 plays and the more it is more a theft is more 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.640
 will heat just by the law of 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.579
 physics 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.220
 here we are then we have the instructions but 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.040
 who cares and we go immediately to 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.430
 see our cv ours as we can 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:08.270
 you see is very very small ok i between 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.720
 here I don't have it here but I have some 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.030
 old c more than that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.550
 it was much much bigger big like 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.960
 precisely plastic casing 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.850
 let's go to see just me too 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.910
 much to see 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.710
 anyway okay here this will be 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.570
 the part we will have to go within 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.230
 inside the socket that is that one 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.110
 quadrettino inside the card 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.810
 mother who is precisely and the housing 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.150
 just for her the processor we see 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.160
 indeed oh well like to say very much 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.440
 cute invest thanks 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:50.240
 and instead there is a power supply here on the 3rd 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.620
 original intel heatsink 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.820
 well we go to the point of 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.520
 insert which you see there is the thermal paste 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.140
 that we're going to enter only at 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.810
 processor so that the fan 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.740
 turning the processor to cold 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.430
 warm and following the operations well 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.840
 guys this is a very very video 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.140
 short and simple 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.459
 I hope the station is like one 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.919
 there computers are clearer there 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.380
 obviously different sockets, that is to say 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:26.090
 that number for example this astoria 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:29.030
 1050 1155 which is precisely the one for 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.710
 the least bad all the third party GPUs 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.320
 third generation i3 i5 i7 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.780
 generation 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.760
 ah here is something that means I am 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.950
 when buying from a processor is the 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.290
 Pay attention to how many you run 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.460
 Also in regard to computer 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.000
 portable when I brought a new one 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.040
 computer 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.610
 watch out for quantum has for 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.350
 example this with four cores and precisely 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.780
 it also said with regard to the 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.840
 sockets to the internet, fixed computers 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.950
 can be modified precisely 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.320
 will pass a changed and design 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.000
 very portable in laptops 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.220
 more complicated 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.550
 last so-called on the fly this 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.590
 processor or inside it has one 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.930
 integrated video card a card 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.700
 graphic therefore not an external scale 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.479
 such as can be sides or the 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.020
 average is precisely l hd 4000 which is 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.620
 quite good 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.150
 a compact one outside because I wanted to 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.490
 then printing on a nice computerino 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.860
 guys this is all this video will be 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.640
 you enjoyed are not all like it 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.640
 soon
