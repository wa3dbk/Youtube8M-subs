00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
on the studio one you can just drop

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.709 
on the studio one you can just drop
right<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.560> track<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.280> tune<00:02:00.210> any<00:02:00.360> guitar

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
right on a track and and tune any guitar

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
right on a track and and tune any guitar
so<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.969> that's<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:04.159> station<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
so that's that's the station here that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.490 
so that's that's the station here that
the<00:02:05.939> da<00:02:06.180> W<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> will<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.259> come<00:02:07.409> over

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the da W if you will if you come over

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.839
