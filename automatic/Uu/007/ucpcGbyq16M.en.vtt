arpeggio sequence we're starting off

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.630 
arpeggio sequence we're starting off
with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.530> Triad<00:01:02.010> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.550> to

then 10 nine on the 4 ok let's have a
look<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> F<00:02:02.579> major<00:02:02.759> 7<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.240> follows<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
look at the F major 7 that follows that

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.030 
look at the F major 7 that follows that
to<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.659> try<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> bit<00:02:07.259> you'll<00:02:07.380> notice<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.799> I'm

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I'm starting with my ring finger and I'm

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.210 
I'm starting with my ring finger and I'm
playing<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.329> 2<00:02:18.720> v<00:02:19.040> 7<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.190> 4th<00:02:20.459> 5<00:02:20.970> 4<00:02:21.299> third

major 7 on 9th fret 4/3 and then the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.990 
major 7 on 9th fret 4/3 and then the
descent<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.609> scale

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
descent down the scale

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.179 
descent down the scale
that's<00:02:29.000> going<00:02:29.239> in<00:02:29.510> 75<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> third<00:02:30.769> string

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
that's going in 75 on the third string

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:42.759 
that's going in 75 on the third string
and<00:02:31.459> then<00:02:32.030> nine<00:02:32.269> seven<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.170> four<00:02:41.769> okay

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
and then nine seven on the four okay

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.080 
and then nine seven on the four okay
just<00:02:43.099> want<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.340> look<00:02:43.400> at<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.640> minor<00:02:43.939> and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
just want to look at the a minor and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.220 
just want to look at the a minor and
then<00:02:44.209> we'll<00:02:44.329> put<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.659> four<00:02:44.870> them<00:02:45.079> together

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
then we'll put all four them together

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.619 
then we'll put all four them together
the<00:02:45.859> E<00:02:45.890> minor<00:02:46.250> seventh<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.760> exactly<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.420> same

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
the E minor seventh is exactly the same

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.750 
the E minor seventh is exactly the same
as<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.049> minor<00:02:48.409> shape<00:02:48.799> wise<00:02:49.099> and<00:02:49.340> fingering

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
as the a minor shape wise and fingering

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.369 
as the a minor shape wise and fingering
all<00:02:50.060> I'm<00:02:50.390> doing<00:02:50.569> is<00:02:50.629> bring<00:02:50.900> everything<00:02:51.200> back

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
the fourth for the third minus seven is

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.569 
the fourth for the third minus seven is
hitting<00:03:04.609> stepping<00:03:04.909> over<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> third<00:03:05.299> string

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
hitting stepping over the third string

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.680 
hitting stepping over the third string
from<00:03:07.579> there<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:08.030> descending<00:03:08.420> down<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
and that's going the descends going five

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.520 
and that's going the descends going five
for<00:03:15.099> my<00:03:15.310> third<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.849> then<00:03:16.389> seven<00:03:17.049> five<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.469> the

so you may just have an idea like what
we<00:04:03.159> have<00:04:03.280> an<00:04:03.370> F<00:04:03.549> major<00:04:03.699> seven<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.269> noticed

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
we have an F major seven you noticed

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.879 
we have an F major seven you noticed
that<00:04:04.659> my<00:04:04.750> fingering<00:04:05.139> I'm<00:04:05.409> starting<00:04:05.769> that

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
that my fingering I'm starting that

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.530 
that my fingering I'm starting that
trial<00:04:06.159> with<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> ring<00:04:06.519> finger<00:04:06.909> and<00:04:07.090> getting

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
trial with the ring finger and getting

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.330 
trial with the ring finger and getting
the<00:04:07.629> pinkie<00:04:07.959> ready<00:04:08.169> to<00:04:08.349> hit<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.530> major<00:04:08.919> seven

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the pinkie ready to hit that major seven

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.069 
the pinkie ready to hit that major seven
eventually<00:04:09.879> so<00:04:10.449> what<00:04:10.569> I'm<00:04:10.659> doing<00:04:10.689> is<00:04:10.900> I'm

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
eventually so what I'm doing is I'm

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.610 
eventually so what I'm doing is I'm
playing<00:04:11.340> eight<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.699> the<00:04:12.879> sixth<00:04:13.269> string<00:04:13.560> 7<00:04:14.560> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
playing eight of the sixth string 7 to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.339 
playing eight of the sixth string 7 to
the<00:04:14.680> fifth<00:04:14.980> five<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.639> the<00:04:15.699> fourth<00:04:15.909> I<00:04:16.349> think

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
the fifth five to the fourth I think

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.649 
the fifth five to the fourth I think
that<00:04:17.470> major<00:04:17.680> seventh<00:04:18.130> note<00:04:18.340> on<00:04:18.579> nine<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.539> the

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
that major seventh note on nine of the

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.279 
that major seventh note on nine of the
fourth<00:04:19.870> string<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.639> from<00:04:21.639> there<00:04:22.289> just

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
fourth string and from there just

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.589 
fourth string and from there just
descending<00:04:24.039> down<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.310> scale<00:04:24.580> that<00:04:25.120> was<00:04:25.240> going

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
descending down the scale that was going

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.020 
descending down the scale that was going
seven<00:04:26.320> five<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.770> fourth<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.250> then<00:04:27.729> eight

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
seven five on the fourth and then eight

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.480 
seven five on the fourth and then eight
