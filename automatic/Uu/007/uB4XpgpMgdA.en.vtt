naturally expand your chunks well slime

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:21.769 
naturally expand your chunks well slime
can<00:00:09.900> spawn<00:00:18.770> here<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.699> chart<00:00:21.510> of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
can spawn here you can see a chart of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.910 
can spawn here you can see a chart of
the<00:00:21.949> trustful<00:00:22.949> online<00:00:23.609> app<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.240> will<00:00:24.420> link<00:00:25.199> here

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the trustful online app I will link here

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.359 
the trustful online app I will link here
and<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:28.050> chunks<00:00:28.949> where

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and you can see in which chunks where

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.849 
and you can see in which chunks where
will<00:00:29.580> spawn<00:00:29.849> slimes<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.599> that's<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:31.199> charge

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
will spawn slimes and that's my charge

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.630 
will spawn slimes and that's my charge
and<00:00:32.189> let's<00:00:33.059> say<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.590> also<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> same<00:00:35.340> but

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and let's say this is also the same but

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.229 
and let's say this is also the same but
it's<00:00:35.880> also<00:00:36.180> using<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.110> feature<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it's also using this feature this is

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.729 
it's also using this feature this is
with<00:00:39.600> zero<00:00:40.050> percent<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:43.010> 20<00:00:44.010> percent

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
with zero percent this is 20 percent

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.790 
with zero percent this is 20 percent
this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.670> 30<00:00:48.120> percent<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.620> see

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
this is with 30 percent and you see

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.450 
this is with 30 percent and you see
there<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.160> always<00:00:50.250> some<00:00:50.789> new<00:00:51.059> chunks<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
there are always some new chunks and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
there are always some new chunks and
yeah<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> got<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> high<00:00:54.059> percentage<00:00:54.690> when

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
yeah you got a high percentage when

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:09.640 
yeah you got a high percentage when
slams<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.280> born

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:20.120 

and<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:13.250> 90%<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:18.260> no<00:01:19.260> this<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> 90%

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and this is 90% this is no this is 90%

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.470 
and this is 90% this is no this is 90%
and<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:22.970> 100%<00:01:24.830> yeah<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.250> every<00:01:26.640> chunk<00:01:26.940> can

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
and this is 100% yeah in every chunk can

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.100 
and this is 100% yeah in every chunk can
aslam<00:01:28.050> spawn<00:01:29.810> now<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.470> prepare<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.640> case<00:01:33.120> down

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
aslam spawn now I prepare the case down

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
aslam spawn now I prepare the case down
there<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.940> will<00:01:36.140> light<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.380> video<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.830> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
there and I will light the video up so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.290 
there and I will light the video up so
you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.390> than<00:01:39.840> me<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:41.300> yeah

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
you can see a bit more than me and yeah

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.330 
you can see a bit more than me and yeah
all<00:01:42.600> already<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.470> creep<00:01:43.770> spawned<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
all already a creep spawned and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
all already a creep spawned and
information<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:48.840> plug<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.440> have

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
information I use to plug in to have

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.630 
information I use to plug in to have
that<00:01:50.010> mode<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.630> show<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> better

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
that mode so I can show you better

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.590 
that mode so I can show you better
without<00:01:53.640> getting<00:01:54.479> damaged<00:01:56.390> some<00:01:57.390> better

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
without getting damaged some better

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
without getting damaged some better
range<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.470> let's<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.770> look

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
range and let's have a look

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.109 
range and let's have a look
I<00:01:59.310> also<00:02:00.060> speed<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.990> because<00:02:02.119> technique

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I also speed this up because technique

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.010 
I also speed this up because technique
video<00:02:03.330> takes<00:02:03.869> me<00:02:04.340> 15<00:02:05.340> minutes<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.210> I'll<00:02:06.630> just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
video takes me 15 minutes and I'll just

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.100 
video takes me 15 minutes and I'll just
don't<00:02:07.590> want<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.220> show<00:02:08.610> 50<00:02:09.090> minutes<00:02:09.390> walking

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
don't want to show 50 minutes walking

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.040 
don't want to show 50 minutes walking
around<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.510> small
