00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
really good and applied combinations

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.509 
really good and applied combinations
when<00:02:41.209> he<00:02:41.329> had<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.719> import<00:02:42.049> off<00:02:42.319> looking<00:02:43.280> at<00:02:43.370> him

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.149 
that really made a the biggest impact on
the<00:02:47.930> fight<00:02:48.109> because<00:02:48.439> when<00:02:48.590> he<00:02:48.680> did<00:02:48.859> throw<00:02:49.040> his

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
the fight because when he did throw his

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.679 
the fight because when he did throw his
