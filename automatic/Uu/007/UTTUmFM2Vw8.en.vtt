00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.420
 for lentils with carrots we are going to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.780
 use a cup or half a pound of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.969
 lentils here and I have them soaking 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 half chopped onion a clove of garlic 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.240
 finely chopped a laurel leaf a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.060
 carrot peeled and diced 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.359
 a tomato cut into cubes three 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.830
 diced ham slices 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 ground pepper to taste salt and oil 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.540
 to fry let's start by putting 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.670
 a pot to the fire we add a little 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 oil and once it's hot we're going 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.530
 to fry the onion for about 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.649
 one minute later add the ham and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 the tomato we move constantly until 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.500
 that the tomato has released all its 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.900
 juice 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.390
 once tomato is almost undone 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.400
 we added the lentils that already had 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.670
 previously washed them I left them soaking 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 for approximately 10 minutes 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.830
 add the lentils and let's add 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.280
 8 cups of liquid can add broth 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.820
 of chicken 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.760
 I'm going to substitute water and a 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.370
 teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.560
 add the carrot season with a 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.040
 little salt and pepper to taste and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.020
 we add the bay leaf we move 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.120
 cover and let's put to the fire until 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.450
 that the lentils are completely 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.240
 cooked 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.520
 if lentils no longer have 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.000
 broth can add more water 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.770
 hot water preference 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.440
 and because that's how simple we made the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 lentils with carrot bay leaf 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.750
 is going to help the fo carlos in addition 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.540
 that gave a slight taste to consume 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 although I do not know chicken broth create the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.600
 that really knows as if they were 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.210
 I am eating a chicken consomme 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.189
 Sheep I do not know if it has a very rich flavor 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 so I hope you liked and 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.420
 See you in the next video 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.759
