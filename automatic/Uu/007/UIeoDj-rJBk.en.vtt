4<00:00:32.219> user<00:00:32.550> interface<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:33.899> sure<00:00:33.930> most<00:00:34.320> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
4 user interface so as I'm sure most of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.930 
4 user interface so as I'm sure most of
the<00:00:34.590> PlayStation<00:00:35.100> fanboys<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.850> have

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the PlayStation fanboys out they have

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.990 
the PlayStation fanboys out they have
noticed<00:00:36.329> already<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.020> XMB<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.219> gone<00:00:38.489> yay

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
noticed already the XMB has not gone yay

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
noticed already the XMB has not gone yay
I<00:00:39.690> mean<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> works<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.379> little<00:00:40.500> different<00:00:40.980> as

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
I mean it works a little different as

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.530 
I mean it works a little different as
you<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:41.579> there's<00:00:41.790> another<00:00:42.059> row<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> icons

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you can see there's another row of icons

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.360 
you can see there's another row of icons
so<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.110> looks<00:00:43.260> more<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> grid<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so it looks more like a grid but it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
so it looks more like a grid but it
still<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.820> essentially<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> xmb<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.710> alive

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
still is essentially the xmb it is alive

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190 
still is essentially the xmb it is alive
as<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> starts<00:00:48.840> off<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.079> your

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
as you can see it starts off with your

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
as you can see it starts off with your
sheet<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:49.800> showing<00:00:50.129> off<00:00:50.280> him<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.640> the
