00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.350
 dragon city how is a small 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.880
 rivals halloween or poor for 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.150
 consider the new dragons that that 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.100
 dragon frankenstein dragon halloween 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 if we can start to see how is this 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.630
 roll 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 ok as we can see are the six 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 following that we have to get what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 are the eyes we get through 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.570
 fights the black cats we got them 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.020
 the dragon course the changes are what 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.550
 which are objects that we get every 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.030
 as if every 12 hours just like 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.500
 fights right here are the posers 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
 We can do every 12 hours or the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.210
 we can start again for two gems 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 the witch hats we got them 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.650
 by getting from the habits of the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 dragons and finally we have the tips 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.330
 at a low scale that we get at 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.589
 buy whatever food comes out the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.720
 description is to leave the link of the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.000
 friends page for dragon city where 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.470
 comes all the information of this yes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.119
 well let's go with a small 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.119
 fight to see how this consists 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.920
 to fight information is the following 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.500
 dragon that follows is the vampire dragon 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.990
 and use of some oil 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.830
 you have to possess mind something like this is very 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.830
 cash against him 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.810
 with the purest 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.080
 pure dragon dot east 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.759
 with this dragon appears from the four 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.490
 water tanks as well as this dragon 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.710
 pure acid rain 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.710
 or that in your critic under a kind of life 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.130
 and he said we were going to attack him with a storm 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.140
 ok as the man already wins 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.210
 it's kind of whether or not they continue with gems 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.780
 since they are only two, it is very clear 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.150
 let's say 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.040
 to know the time lost because if 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.050
 it takes a little bit to upload this video and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.790
 because this is what consists in what 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.050
 it's the halloween island that are got 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.300
 two dragons what is the dragon 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.120
 Frankenstein and the Dragon Halloween 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.310
 you can see what you can buy everything for 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.800
 193 gems or depending on the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.209
 complicated communities completed you 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.340
 it may be a different price here but 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.170
 Well that's the joke you do not need 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.840
 get it say these objects 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.940
 daily and then I hope to get minimum 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.730
 from one of the two dragons as they can 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.250
 see was this little guy this is more 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.460
 matter of waiting for time I quoted it in 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.650
 diaries that are the changes 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.300
 the battles we can start for each 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.670
 two gems if we want that I want 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.650
 publish another few Greeks in my subjects 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.960
 I 'd better wait for a little while over 12 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.370
 hours and then sneaks into the discussions 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.260
