that's what i find most useful for pvp

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
that's what i find most useful for pvp
i'm<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.710> sites<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.460> take

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
i'm not really good with sites that take

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.370 
i'm not really good with sites that take
up<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> lot<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.390> real<00:01:42.600> estate<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.259> you'll

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
up a lot of real estate but what you'll

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.069 
up a lot of real estate but what you'll
find<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.159> sides<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.700> gun<00:01:45.079> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
find with the two sides on this gun the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
find with the two sides on this gun the
other<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.380> sites<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.579> very<00:01:47.759> useful<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
other two sites are very very useful in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
other two sites are very very useful in
PvE<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.950> kind

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
PvE you can see this one here it's kind

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.920 
PvE you can see this one here it's kind
of<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.340> acog<00:01:50.700> scope<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.810> mean

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
of like an acog scope but really I mean

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.969 
of like an acog scope but really I mean
it<00:01:51.990> takes<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> screen<00:01:52.770> real<00:01:52.920> estate

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it takes up a lot of screen real estate

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
it takes up a lot of screen real estate
but<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.360> zoomed<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
but I like that it's not very zoomed in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109 
but I like that it's not very zoomed in
and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> other<00:01:55.979> side<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.430> also<00:01:56.820> kind<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and then the other side is also kind of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
and then the other side is also kind of
a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.479> cottage<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.020> once<00:01:58.170> again<00:01:58.290> also

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
a little a cottage but once again also

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.010 
a little a cottage but once again also
they<00:01:59.430> both<00:01:59.700> don't<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.299> zoom<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.869> much

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
they both don't really zoom in that much

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.330 
they both don't really zoom in that much
and<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> important

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and for me that's kind of important

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
and for me that's kind of important
because<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.180> lose<00:02:03.299> track<00:02:03.409> tracking<00:02:04.409> up

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
because I kind of lose track tracking up

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.420 
because I kind of lose track tracking up
targets<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.280> zoomed<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.610> too<00:02:05.790> much

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
targets when it zoomed in too much

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.100 
targets when it zoomed in too much
so<00:02:06.670> now<00:02:06.850> when<00:02:07.180> it<00:02:07.270> comes<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.720> stats<00:02:07.990> i'm

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
so now when it comes to the stats i'm

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.450 
so now when it comes to the stats i'm
gonna<00:02:08.229> compare<00:02:08.320> it<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.740> my<00:02:08.890> shin<00:02:09.160> Ginny

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
gonna compare it to my shin Ginny

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.130 
gonna compare it to my shin Ginny
because<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.910> almost<00:02:10.060> identical<00:02:10.300> except

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
because it is almost identical except

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.440 
because it is almost identical except
slight<00:02:11.440> boost<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.950> range<00:02:12.330> stability<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
slight boost on the range stability and

slight boost on the range stability and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.700 
reload on the shin gin but the SH engine

so<00:05:08.400> so<00:05:08.699> much<00:05:08.910> but<00:05:09.539> I've<00:05:09.810> been<00:05:09.960> using<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.289> more

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
so so much but I've been using this more

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.070 
so so much but I've been using this more
because<00:05:11.669> of<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.850> fact<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.210> freedom<00:05:12.539> feeding

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
because of the fact of freedom feeding

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.379 
because of the fact of freedom feeding
frenzy<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:14.070> reload<00:05:14.400> really<00:05:14.669> fast<00:05:14.940> now<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
frenzy you reload really fast now the

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.140 
frenzy you reload really fast now the
Maya<00:05:15.720> Moto's<00:05:16.110> got<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.380> 67<00:05:17.010> round<00:05:17.310> clip<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:18.060> you

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
Maya Moto's got a 67 round clip so you

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.000 
Maya Moto's got a 67 round clip so you
could<00:05:18.240> just<00:05:18.330> totally<00:05:18.660> spray<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.889> my

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
could just totally spray and that the my

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.920 
could just totally spray and that the my
moto<00:05:20.250> is<00:05:20.400> better<00:05:20.639> for<00:05:20.910> taking<00:05:21.210> down<00:05:21.360> bosses

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
moto is better for taking down bosses

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.560 
moto is better for taking down bosses
because<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:22.800> spray<00:05:23.190> spray<00:05:23.700> spray<00:05:23.729> down

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
because you just spray spray spray down

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.110 
because you just spray spray spray down
low<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:24.870> it'll<00:05:25.320> just<00:05:25.430> recall<00:05:26.430> vertically<00:05:26.970> up

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
low and it'll just recall vertically up

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.690 
low and it'll just recall vertically up
so<00:05:27.450> that's<00:05:27.930> what<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.110> find<00:05:28.380> when<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:28.919> compare

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700

so<00:06:57.730> I<00:06:58.030> was<00:06:58.330> using<00:06:58.510> it<00:06:58.690> I<00:06:58.780> mean<00:06:58.960> it's<00:06:59.560> kind<00:06:59.740> of

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
so I was using it I mean it's kind of

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.410 
so I was using it I mean it's kind of
fun<00:06:59.980> but<00:07:00.160> I<00:07:00.220> out<00:07:00.760> of<00:07:00.940> though<00:07:01.000> I<00:07:01.030> just<00:07:01.300> think

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420 
fun but I out of though I just think

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.330 
fun but I out of though I just think
it's<00:07:01.510> cheap<00:07:01.750> and<00:07:01.930> when<00:07:02.320> it<00:07:02.410> comes<00:07:02.560> to<00:07:02.680> PVE<00:07:02.980> I'd

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
it's cheap and when it comes to PVE I'd

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.730 
it's cheap and when it comes to PVE I'd
rather<00:07:03.490> use<00:07:03.790> my<00:07:03.900> zombie<00:07:04.900> apocalypse<00:07:05.530> as

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
rather use my zombie apocalypse as

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.260 
rather use my zombie apocalypse as
