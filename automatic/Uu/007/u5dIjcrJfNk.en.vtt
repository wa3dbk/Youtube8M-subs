00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.330
 At the last IFA in Berlin we saw a multitude of devices that start to get 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.520
 the sale these weeks, facing the upcoming Christmas dates. Last week he was throwing 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.029
 in Spain, which is an update of LG G Watch, the Watch R. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.090
 It stands out as attractive its careful design and circular shape, something that we had thrown out 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.390
 Missing in the smartwath we had seen to date. 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 It is available only in black, but we will have the possibility to exchange 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.020
 their belts, which, of course, are sold separately and, as we have seen, 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.970
 the anchoring system is the one that the common clocks use, with which, they do not have to be 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.430
 originals 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.489
 With respect to the dial, it is made of metal and has as its only added one 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.870
 crown that works as a start button. 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 Its dimensions may seem somewhat high, especially if we put it in small hands 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.750
 and fine wrists and, although the thickness is 9.7 mm, thanks to its design 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719
 It seems excessive. 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.560
 To this we must add that its weight is only 62 grams, so we will hardly notice 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.799
 that we wear on our wrist. 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.400
 Its 1.3-inch P-Oled screen allows you to obtain about 245 dots per inch. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.490
 Therefore, visualize the notifications, the maps indications or any other function 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.990
 It will be really comfortable. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.869
 The synchronization is really simple since we will only have to start the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.369
 clock and follow the indications that this is giving us. 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.530
 Once installed android wear on our smartphone, the pairing will be done 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.050
 via bluetooth, since the Watch R lacks NFC. 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.689
 We already knew Android Wear with its predecessor, which we also saw under our spotlights 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.470
 and little or no variation has been made with respect to the version we have already analyzed. 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.590
 We will find an activity meter that allows to control besides steps, our 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 pulsations. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.080
 Thanks to the ip67 certification, we can take it practically in any condition 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.269
 climatological; The map application with which will indicate us in a simple way how 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.150
 get where we need; control music playback through Google music or Google 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.370
 Now: with which to enter simple commands as reminders, send emails, set alarms 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:03:09.059
 or send sms, will be the most outstanding functions. 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.370
 It counts among its sensors with gyrometer, accelerometer, compass, barometer and, as 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:23.120
 we have already commented, heart rate monitor. 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.459
 To move smoothly the Android version wear, incorporates a Snapdragon processor 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.809
 400 to 1.2 gigahertz together with 512 megabytes of ram and 4 gigs of storage 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:35.309
 no possibility of extension. 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:04:16.120
 One of the most controversial aspects in the smartwatches sector is the battery 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.620
 and, unfortunately this Watch R does not come to revolutionize the segment. 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.970
 The duration, with normal use, barely reached the day and a half, so the 410 mAh seems 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.530
 continue to be insufficient for a full-color screen and with such powerful hardware. 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.360
 The R watch comes to introduce something that many asked for and is the fact that a smartwatch 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.379
 had a clock shape, with a circular screen and not square, something that we had only seen 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.630
 on the moto360. 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.419
 A very interesting hardware that is able to move fluidly android wear to be 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.980
 aware of all our notifications in social networks, emails or any other 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.349
 that we configure in our smartphone. 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.860
 We liked its design and customization possibilities, not only on the strap, 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:17.090
 but also in the different spheres. 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.430
 You can install a launcher for better management of your applications and thanks 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.770
 to shortcuts, there is the possibility of silencing your smartphone and smartwatch, 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.930
 activate thethering or check the battery status of both devices with a 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.930
 just gesture. 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.330
 Anyway, note that these devices still have a lot of software-level travel 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.729
 and that, above all, it is missing a longer battery life, since it is the appearance 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.759
 which constitutes its main Achilles heel. 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.139
 It is already available on the website of Pccomponentes, we leave a link in the description.
