00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.700
 here 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.570
 how about August 2 this just came to me 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.650
 I'm very excited I just wanted 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.189
 sharing is a welcome letter 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.890
 and a delivery certification is 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.860
 tomorrow I just received by fedex from 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 germany is not enough to see here 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.190
 jermaine germ and forgiveness 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.070
 the new world currency by putting it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.650
 that point of view and I'm excited 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.480
 because of what 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.310
 and great financial changes are coming 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.240
 on the card that they wanted to show 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.740
 share 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.110
 look how interesting to get it out 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.720
 this that is here in 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.260
 if you can see in the camera something about 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.770
 of what is that to the medium is a gram 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 of gold evaluated around 60 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 euros or just about seventy and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.300
 so many dollars roughly tell them 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.490
 this because 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.620
 a year of researching to see if this was 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.680
 legitimate as we all have doubts but 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.480
 I think that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.540
 in what you have to be is informed 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.180
 this 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.460
 tremendous fiasco very big our 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.860
 financial system we believed in the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.720
 mortgages everyone believed in those 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.750
 financial instruments and in the end 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.000
 we all know what happened greece spain 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.130
 etcetera in a total collapse 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.280
 there is really nothing safe 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.590
 one hundred percent and that is important but 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.830
 the most interesting thing is to be at the beginning 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.510
 of financial bubbles like the real 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.780
 state of the last ten years in the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.910
 goods countries according to experts 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.770
 there is even a video in our 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.670
 pages in nor create business script in 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.580
 youtube and on facebook where I break you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.400
 faces the chairman of the reserve 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.170
 federal ben bernanke on the subject of 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.750
 gold I only recommend are only four 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.840
 minutes where they will be very 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.430
 impressed the conversation that has 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.500
 the candidate who was a candidate for 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.850
 presidency of uruguay by the party 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.760
 Republican and talks about the issue of 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.730
 gold with very interesting nanking role 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.330
 I 'll tell you this because in the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.330
 October 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.510
 of 2010 the ounce of gold cost 700 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.999
 dollars on Tuesday last week it 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.020
 they rob thousand almost 1600 dollars 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:45.540
 we are talking about a great fort 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 they all say if it's an exact bubble is 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.090
 the next bubble unfortunately for 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.900
 the policy of the federal reserve of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.670
 print print print more money no 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 I want to go into detail but I already 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.310
 we have seen there are many 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.409
 changes in the market and the experts 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.409
 they say it was possible that the ounce of 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.270
 Gold can cost up to 15 thousand 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.640
 dollars an ounce for 2015 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:18.700
 in the next 23 years from 3,000 to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:25.500
 4,000 what great experts say it says 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:28.140
 perfect an expert in finance 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.540
 an extraordinary politician but it is more 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.230
 that all understand this is to change this 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.120
 paper for something else the banks do not sell 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.830
 gold or jewelry stores do not sell either 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.940
 rings I'm talking about a gold with a 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.940
 stamp of london as original 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.790
 soon 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.050
 the Vatican seal will come and that 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.430
 it's a very big credibility in the 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.680
 market to be more secure 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.330
 take advantage of this bubble in our 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.950
 marketing business page I think that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.710
 there is more information about it where 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.750
 you can acquire this and I wanted it 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.240
 share because it caught my attention 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.030
 what 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.730
 world buffet carlos slim- china india 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.040
 all these countries are buying gold 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.280
 in impressive amounts just like 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.080
 that the silver that indicates that is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.520
 possible of some very big change I know 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.030
 that many who know him but not 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.770
 we are acting here is the action a 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.210
 gram of gold within reach of any 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.950
 person are less than 100 dollars I think 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.770
 that it is better to have them in gold than 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.400
 have them in the supermarket truth or the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:43.380
 pocket of our children good the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.350
 I leave and finally I recommend them 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.950
 I suggest that they secure their finances and 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.630
 worry about inflation not having a 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.320
 bank collapse as everyone tells us 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:59.420
 but if life is going to be more expensive than 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.030
 if you win the same thing we win the same 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.240
 things go up a long time ago 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.120
 difficult the situation I leave then 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.169
 with this 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.689
 any question 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.029
 just write there I tell you how 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.650
 buy it is easy not easy 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.080
 there is nothing cost there is no cost 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.199
 maintenance bank accounts in switzerland and 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.029
