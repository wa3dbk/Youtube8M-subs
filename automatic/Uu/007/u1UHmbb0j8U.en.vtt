00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
this is nathan and i am bringing you

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.769 
this is nathan and i am bringing you
part<00:00:02.370> 5<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.480> SPS<00:00:04.049> tutorial<00:00:04.560> so<00:00:05.279> uh<00:00:05.450> this<00:00:06.450> in

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
part 5 of the SPS tutorial so uh this in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.879 
part 5 of the SPS tutorial so uh this in
this<00:00:07.109> tutorial<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.799> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.870> optimize

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
this tutorial we are going to optimize

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.610 
this tutorial we are going to optimize
the<00:00:10.889> frame<00:00:11.849> rate<00:00:12.120> for<00:00:12.719> our<00:00:12.960> little<00:00:13.290> game<00:00:13.590> here

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the frame rate for our little game here

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.189 
the frame rate for our little game here
or<00:00:14.490> at<00:00:14.549> least<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> beginning<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.020> might

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
or at least for the beginning we might

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.370 
or at least for the beginning we might
get<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.590> more<00:00:16.770> later<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:18.020> most<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.230> you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
get to more later on but for most of you

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.460 
get to more later on but for most of you
we<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> pretty<00:00:21.600> good<00:00:21.689> computer<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.410> I'm

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
we I have a pretty good computer and I'm

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.640 
we I have a pretty good computer and I'm
running<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:24.140> 15<00:00:25.140> frames<00:00:25.439> per

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
running this at like 15 frames per

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.990 
running this at like 15 frames per
second<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.939> that's<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.779> very<00:00:28.109> good<00:00:28.260> so

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
second so that's that's not very good so

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.490 
second so that's that's not very good so
I'm<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> show<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.630> guys<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.900> quick

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
I'm just going to show you guys a quick

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
I'm just going to show you guys a quick
tip<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.130> how<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> make<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.910> run<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> little<00:00:33.300> bit

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
tip on how to make it run a little bit

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.150 
tip on how to make it run a little bit
faster<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> let's<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> coding<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
faster and so let's get to coding it so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
faster and so let's get to coding it so
we're<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:38.790> into<00:00:39.030> our<00:00:39.210> movement

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
we're going to go into our movement

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.619 
we're going to go into our movement
scripts<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.390> just<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> very

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
scripts over here and just at the very

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.369 
scripts over here and just at the very
bottom<00:00:43.050> we're<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> type<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.910> game

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
bottom we're going to type the game

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.290 
bottom we're going to type the game
logic<00:00:46.789> set<00:00:48.140> logic<00:00:51.079> tic<00:00:52.079> rate<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.090> then<00:00:54.090> we're

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
logic set logic tic rate and then we're

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.459 
logic set logic tic rate and then we're
going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.780> 30<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> cut<00:00:57.780> how

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
going to put 30 this is going to cut how

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
going to put 30 this is going to cut how
many<00:00:58.680> times<00:00:59.010> the<00:01:00.000> game<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.870> checking<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.550> game

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
many times the game is checking the game

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
many times the game is checking the game
logic<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.140> its<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> cut<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.129> half

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
logic so in its going to cut it in half

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.370 
logic so in its going to cut it in half
so<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.659> much<00:01:06.840> almost

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so this is going to pretty much almost

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.359 
so this is going to pretty much almost
double<00:01:08.130> our<00:01:08.280> frame<00:01:08.549> way<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.740> let's<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.159> start

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
double our frame way so let's just start

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.420 
double our frame way so let's just start
up<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> game<00:01:11.760> engine<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.890> right<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
up the game engine here and right now I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
up the game engine here and right now I
am<00:01:14.610> running<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:16.820> 14<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.420> 14<00:01:18.960> frames

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
am running it at 14 just about 14 frames

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.370 
am running it at 14 just about 14 frames
per<00:01:19.619> second<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:21.380> Camtasia

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
per second and this is with my Camtasia

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
per second and this is with my Camtasia
recorder<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.930> kills

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
recorder going and that kind of kills

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
recorder going and that kind of kills
the<00:01:25.350> frame<00:01:25.590> rate<00:01:25.830> too<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.909> now<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the frame rate too so now we're going to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010 
the frame rate too so now we're going to
lower<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.920> physics<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:30.000> game<00:01:30.750> lot

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
lower the physics a little bit game lot

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.499 
lower the physics a little bit game lot
we're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> type<00:01:32.189> after<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.729> game

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
we're going to type after that game

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.469 
we're going to type after that game
logic<00:01:34.049> dot<00:01:34.439> set<00:01:35.570> physics<00:01:36.650> tick<00:01:37.650> rate<00:01:38.479> and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
logic dot set physics tick rate and

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.710 
logic dot set physics tick rate and
we're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> set<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> 30

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
we're going to set it to 30

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.490 
we're going to set it to 30
and<00:01:41.810> now<00:01:42.560> let's<00:01:42.800> start<00:01:43.070> up<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> game<00:01:43.400> engine

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
and now let's start up the game engine

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.400 
and now let's start up the game engine
now<00:01:45.500> I'm<00:01:45.740> I'm<00:01:46.520> running<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.150> at<00:01:47.300> 14<00:01:47.870> frames<00:01:48.140> per

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
now I'm I'm running it at 14 frames per

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.210 
now I'm I'm running it at 14 frames per
second<00:01:48.830> still<00:01:49.210> but<00:01:50.410> you<00:01:51.410> will<00:01:51.620> be<00:01:51.650> running<00:01:52.010> it

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
second still but you will be running it

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.060 
second still but you will be running it
probably<00:01:52.790> like<00:01:53.120> 30<00:01:53.570> frames<00:01:53.930> per<00:01:54.080> second<00:01:54.590> just

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
probably like 30 frames per second just

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.450 
probably like 30 frames per second just
because<00:01:55.690> i<00:01:56.690> have<00:01:57.230> my<00:01:57.440> recorder<00:01:57.950> going<00:01:58.130> and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
because i have my recorder going and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.790 
because i have my recorder going and
that<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.630> just<00:01:59.960> like<00:02:00.140> youtube<00:02:00.590> it

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
that just it's it's just like youtube it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.480 
that just it's it's just like youtube it
kind<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.010> kills<00:02:01.310> everything<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:04.040> there's

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
kind of kills everything but so there's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.420 
kind of kills everything but so there's
that<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.020> lot<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.800> wanted<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.250> know

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
that so now a lot of you wanted to know

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.810 
that so now a lot of you wanted to know
how<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.929> add<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:11.680> crosshair<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.010> let's<00:02:13.460> do

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
how to add a a crosshair so let's do

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.130 
how to add a a crosshair so let's do
that<00:02:13.850> real<00:02:14.209> quick<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:15.200> i'm<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.160> put<00:02:16.910> our

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that real quick so i'm going to put our

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.640 
that real quick so i'm going to put our
cursor<00:02:18.140> right<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.950> front<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.610> our<00:02:20.090> camera<00:02:21.080> just

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
cursor right in front of our camera just

press f9 and go to UV texture and click
new<00:03:00.410> now<00:03:01.250> we<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.610> go<00:03:01.820> back<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.330> our<00:03:02.570> crosshair

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
new now we can go back to our crosshair

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.300 
new now we can go back to our crosshair
and<00:03:03.290> there<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.100> go<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:05.330> um<00:03:05.860> we're<00:03:06.860> going<00:03:07.130> to

cursor is already like right next to
thee<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.640> crosshair<00:03:43.640> which<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.569> going<00:03:44.750> to

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
thee to the crosshair which is going to

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.539 
thee to the crosshair which is going to
be<00:03:44.989> right<00:03:45.349> there<00:03:45.590> I'll<00:03:45.709> zoom<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.099> for<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.340> guys

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and we need to go to space add empty and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.630 
and we need to go to space add empty and
it<00:03:52.750> got<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.870> zoom<00:03:54.019> out<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.260> little<00:03:54.319> bit<00:03:54.560> there<00:03:54.799> so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
the x axis pointing in back of me I'll

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.740 
the x axis pointing in back of me I'll
back<00:04:11.629> of<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.840> player<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:12.409> I'm<00:04:12.620> going<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.040> just

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
back of the player so I'm going to just

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.599 
back of the player so I'm going to just
parent<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:17.709> empty<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:18.889> just<00:04:19.070> added<00:04:19.250> to

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
parent this the empty we just added to

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.439 
parent this the empty we just added to
the<00:04:20.060> crosshair<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.799> now<00:04:21.889> we've<00:04:22.070> got<00:04:22.280> that<00:04:22.520> now

the crosshair so now we've got that now

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.439 
the crosshair so now we've got that now
we<00:04:23.510> need<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.840> click<00:04:24.530> on<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:25.490> only<00:04:25.970> on<00:04:26.150> the

we need to click on just only on the
empty<00:04:27.260> we<00:04:27.440> just<00:04:27.710> added<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.970> are<00:04:29.030> going<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.539> add

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
empty we just added we are going to add

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.020 
empty we just added we are going to add
a<00:04:31.120> sensor<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:33.070> it's<00:04:34.070> going<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.580> be<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.760> race

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
a sensor and it's going to be a race

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.050 
a sensor and it's going to be a race
answer<00:04:35.570> we're<00:04:36.440> going<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.650> look<00:04:37.220> for<00:04:37.280> property

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
answer we're going to look for property

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.770 
answer we're going to look for property
of<00:04:38.270> an<00:04:38.539> object<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.419> you'll<00:04:41.419> see<00:04:41.630> what

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
of an object this is you'll see what

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.480 
of an object this is you'll see what
we're<00:04:41.900> doing<00:04:42.139> this<00:04:42.260> later<00:04:42.560> we're<00:04:43.310> going<00:04:43.400> to

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
we're doing this later we're going to

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.240 
we're doing this later we're going to
call<00:04:43.760> this<00:04:43.789> um<00:04:44.710> we're<00:04:45.710> just<00:04:45.830> going<00:04:45.949> to<00:04:46.010> call

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
call this um we're just going to call

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.010 
call this um we're just going to call
this<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.930> ray<00:04:48.400> just<00:04:49.400> for<00:04:49.849> being<00:04:50.479> a<00:04:50.599> little<00:04:50.750> big

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
this the ray just for being a little big

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.080 
this the ray just for being a little big
there<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:51.470> we're<00:04:52.370> going<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.520> set<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.849> range

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
there and we're going to set the range

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.550 
there and we're going to set the range
to<00:04:53.510> like<00:04:54.160> 150<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.449> we're<00:04:56.449> going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.990> set<00:04:57.530> it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
to like 150 and we're going to set it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.580 
to like 150 and we're going to set it
for<00:04:58.490> me<00:04:58.639> it's<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.120> negative<00:04:59.599> x<00:04:59.840> axis<00:05:00.349> because

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
for me it's the negative x axis because

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.560 
for me it's the negative x axis because
we<00:05:00.889> want<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.310> go<00:05:01.460> forward<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:04.210> yeah<00:05:05.210> make

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
we want it to go forward and yeah make

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.219 
we want it to go forward and yeah make
sure<00:05:05.599> that<00:05:06.260> if<00:05:06.490> if<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.729> can<00:05:07.880> visualize<00:05:08.229> the

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
sure that if if you can visualize the

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.400 
sure that if if you can visualize the
negative<00:05:09.620> x<00:05:09.830> axis<00:05:10.340> this<00:05:10.880> right<00:05:11.240> here<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.750> would

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
negative x axis this right here it would

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.779 
negative x axis this right here it would
be<00:05:12.590> going<00:05:12.949> that<00:05:13.550> way<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.930> make<00:05:15.349> sure<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.490> it

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
be going that way so make sure it the it

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.529 
be going that way so make sure it the it
would<00:05:17.210> not<00:05:17.449> be<00:05:17.830> hitting<00:05:18.830> any<00:05:19.099> guns<00:05:19.940> or<00:05:20.150> nothing

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
would not be hitting any guns or nothing

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.469 
would not be hitting any guns or nothing
and<00:05:20.690> it's<00:05:21.080> not<00:05:21.320> as<00:05:21.500> in<00:05:21.650> not<00:05:21.979> in<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.130> way<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:23.180> I'm

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
and it's not as in not in the way so I'm

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.170 
and it's not as in not in the way so I'm
going<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.690> set<00:05:23.930> this<00:05:24.139> to<00:05:24.440> negative<00:05:25.099> x<00:05:25.340> axis<00:05:26.000> and

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
going to set this to negative x axis and

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.659 
going to set this to negative x axis and
we're<00:05:26.479> going<00:05:26.599> to<00:05:26.659> check<00:05:27.530> this<00:05:27.770> dot<00:05:28.099> dot<00:05:28.400> dot

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
we're going to check this dot dot dot

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.999 
we're going to check this dot dot dot
here

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.020 

okay<00:05:34.009> so<00:05:34.069> now<00:05:35.259> we<00:05:36.259> are<00:05:36.500> going<00:05:37.069> to<00:05:37.370> set<00:05:37.669> up<00:05:37.819> our

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
okay so now we are going to set up our

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.350 
okay so now we are going to set up our
basic<00:05:39.460> oh<00:05:40.599> wait<00:05:41.599> I<00:05:41.810> forgot<00:05:42.050> we<00:05:42.410> need<00:05:42.560> to<00:05:42.710> add<00:05:43.360> we

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
basic oh wait I forgot we need to add we

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.900 
basic oh wait I forgot we need to add we
need<00:05:44.479> to<00:05:44.569> go<00:05:44.720> into<00:05:44.930> another<00:05:45.500> layer<00:05:45.860> I<00:05:46.130> think<00:05:46.759> we

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
need to go into another layer I think we

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.159 
need to go into another layer I think we
already<00:05:47.030> did<00:05:47.270> this<00:05:47.419> and<00:05:47.690> one<00:05:47.930> of<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.110> other

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
already did this and one of the other

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.510 
already did this and one of the other
tutorials<00:05:48.860> but<00:05:49.669> we<00:05:49.819> are<00:05:49.940> going<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:50.919> we<00:05:51.919> I<00:05:52.130> just

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
tutorials but we are going to we I just

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.210 
tutorials but we are going to we I just
basically<00:05:53.000> added<00:05:53.569> a<00:05:54.160> cube<00:05:55.160> and<00:05:56.830> put<00:05:57.830> check

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
basically added a cube and put check

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.700 
basically added a cube and put check
actor<00:05:58.759> and<00:05:59.030> dynamic<00:05:59.630> and<00:05:59.810> made<00:06:00.020> the<00:06:00.229> radius

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
actor and dynamic and made the radius

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.790 
actor and dynamic and made the radius
like<00:06:01.250> five<00:06:01.910> times<00:06:02.270> bigger<00:06:02.599> than<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:03.110> cube

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
like five times bigger than the cube

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.830 
like five times bigger than the cube
make<00:06:04.370> sure<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.699> cube<00:06:04.970> is<00:06:05.120> fairly<00:06:05.389> small

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
make sure the cube is fairly small

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.450 
make sure the cube is fairly small
though<00:06:06.080> as<00:06:06.289> this<00:06:06.470> is<00:06:06.650> going<00:06:06.860> to<00:06:07.009> act<00:06:07.160> as<00:06:07.340> our

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
