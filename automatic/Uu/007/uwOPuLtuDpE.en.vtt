00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
let's jump into one of our master pages

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.100 
let's jump into one of our master pages
will<00:01:09.990> choose<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.439> light<00:01:11.040> page<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.110> this

that<00:01:16.560> sort<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> thing<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.159> let's<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.549> click

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that sort of thing so let's just click

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.690

the<00:01:17.820> navigation<00:01:17.939> bar<00:01:18.509> select<00:01:19.470> we'll<00:01:20.460> just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the navigation bar select we'll just

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.570

pick<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> different<00:01:21.090> blue<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pick a different blue here and this is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.149 
pick a different blue here and this is
using<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> image<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.530> tiled<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
using a image that's tiled in the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.320 
using a image that's tiled in the
background<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> create<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
background to create kind of that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
background to create kind of that
texture<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.080> let's<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.740> fill<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.189> let's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
texture so let's go up to fill and let's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
texture so let's go up to fill and let's
delete<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.270> image<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.930> let's<00:01:31.920> change<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
delete that image and let's change the

delete that image and let's change the
color<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.479> blue<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:35.150> now<00:01:36.150> when

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
color of that to blue as well now when

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.690 
color of that to blue as well now when
we<00:01:36.360> drop<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.110> our<00:01:37.320> plan<00:01:37.979> view<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.549> can

wondering when these pages are created

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.449 
wondering when these pages are created
the<00:02:37.170> completely<00:02:37.500> blank<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.989> often<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.860> want<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
the completely blank and often we want a

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.699 
the completely blank and often we want a
similar<00:02:41.850> structure<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.540> our<00:02:42.690> actual<00:02:43.170> content

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
throughout all pages so the trick to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.100 
throughout all pages so the trick to
this<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.620> let's<00:02:47.040> go<00:02:47.160> up<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.340> edit<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.110> select
