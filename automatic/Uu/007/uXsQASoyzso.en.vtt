Cecil<00:01:54.930> castellucci<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.250> an<00:01:56.369> alien<00:01:56.880> story

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
Cecil castellucci this is an alien story

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.819 
Cecil castellucci this is an alien story
which<00:01:57.600> i<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.200> you'd<00:01:58.320> asked<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.740> couple

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
which i think if you'd asked me a couple

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.319 
which i think if you'd asked me a couple
years<00:01:59.009> ago<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> probably<00:01:59.790> would<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.119> said<00:02:00.299> I

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
years ago I probably would have said I

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
years ago I probably would have said I
had<00:02:00.509> no<00:02:00.659> interest<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.259> alien<00:02:01.619> stories<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
had no interest in alien stories but I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
had no interest in alien stories but I
think<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.360> maybe<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
think that's maybe like you know a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
think that's maybe like you know a
coming<00:02:05.159> trend<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.700> why<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.299> there<00:02:06.450> have

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
coming trend in why a because there have

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
coming trend in why a because there have
been<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> number<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:07.170> course<00:02:07.799> Ricky<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.550> sees

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
been a number of course Ricky and sees

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.479 
been a number of course Ricky and sees
the<00:02:08.759> fifth<00:02:09.090> wave<00:02:09.239> has<00:02:09.539> blown<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.920> that's

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the fifth wave has blown up so that's

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.760 
the fifth wave has blown up so that's
certainly<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.239> help<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.540> alien<00:02:13.230> push

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
certainly going to help that alien push

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.140 
certainly going to help that alien push
it<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.040> think<00:02:14.370> people<00:02:14.640> are<00:02:14.760> starting<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
it I think people are starting to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.940 
it I think people are starting to
approach<00:02:15.570> aliens<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.710> more

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
approach aliens in a much more

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.040 
approach aliens in a much more
intriguing<00:02:17.370> way<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:18.330> one<00:02:18.570> sounds

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
intriguing way this one sounds

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.400 
intriguing way this one sounds
phenomenal<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.460> I'm<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.720> excited<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
phenomenal so I'm so so excited for this

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.080 
phenomenal so I'm so so excited for this
one<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.070> actually<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.550> another<00:02:23.880> book

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
