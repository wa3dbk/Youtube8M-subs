Archery Mule Deer Hunting - An Amazing Bow Hunt

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.580
At more than a mile and in low light conditions, I was lucky to spot a mule deer buck bedded down beneath some cliffs.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.980
He laid his head down indication he was not going anywhere anytime soon.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.520
With the end of season coming near, I was not going to pass up this mule deer buck.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.040
So, I left a camera rolling on the tripod and headed over for the other side of the canyon

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.200
I was hoping to see the buck from atop the bluff, but could not find him.

00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:13.473
It had been an hour since I had seen him, so he was either out of sight, or had left.

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:20.936
The wind was light and variable, so I knew time was of the essence.

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:27.325
Not knowing if he was still there, I decided to try my luck with a rock toss

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.040
Rock 1 stood him up, but he was still out of sight, so I tossed another

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.360
The rock through worded, but he would not stop. I let down the bow, and ranged an area where I thought he might appear

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:17.120
Man that was intese. I did not know he was that close. He was 15 yards that whole time.Yes!

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.880
After taking a few moments to let the adrenalin settle, tha camstrap came off and I replayed the footage

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.800
After laying hands on his rack, I hiked out and got my brother shawn, who brought his packboard along for the pack out

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.160
Not bad for 4 days left in the season

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.720
Well, as far as this canyon goes, that wasn't too bad
