00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.910
 hello how about people how are we going here 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.940
 andres de poker to give in a video already in 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.830
 2015 happy new year merry christmas and 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.350
 happy all those celebrations where 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.289
 you eat a lot this week I'll 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.060
 I bring to dredges and then I bring 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.310
 dredged because it's a little mountain I liked it 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.829
 I could pretty much say it's my favorite 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.169
 of this new generation and well let's 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.780
 begin to give make that dragon type and 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.350
 poison and badly is weak at the same 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.960
 dragon ice earth and psychic somewhat 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.610
 common types but the anger here is that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.250
 they are faster than dredging something in their 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.800
 The majority of the cargo exits two 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.420
 they are point toxic opposition point that 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.790
 basically it would be the same as 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.000
 Toxic touch poison town the only 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.190
 difference is that point or point 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.090
 you have to make contact the opponent 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.130
 with you when I touch or touch you have 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.390
 that being in contact with the opponent is 30 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.150
 percent of poison and is a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.979
 good skill but the best is 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.659
 adaptable adapts violin and which 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.299
 power by the two movements that 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.080
 just this is what it means that dragon 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.970
 and poison yes 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.480
 to hit by two as if they were super 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.480
 effective 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.660
 the dredging statistics are good 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.340
 they are good they are not so bad in fact 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.920
 their speed is pretty good 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 has a great special defense that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.150
 it serves you well against psychics has 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 a pretty good special attack a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.320
 Decent defense can be improved if the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.540
 you train and the attack is not so good 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.460
 but I think that one thing or another if you 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.160
 It can help life is not so 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 good but let's say that in general it's a 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.540
 unusual that you have statistics 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 quite average and somewhat defensive 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.009
 there we have them at level 50 as they can 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.350
 see the special defense almost at 200 that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.180
 amazing I'm surprising because it's 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 a dragon type pokemon that does not have the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.040
 aspect of it being so defensive here 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.080
 how to strike, so to speak 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 and at level 100 we see that almost all 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.420
 states surpass 300 if they are maximized 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.550
 as strategies already in if I'm going to start 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680
 with the offensives and we have once 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.530
 English where we're basically going to put him 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.170
 choice spex or the chosen glasses a 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.050
 comet dragon a web slots that is wave 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
 toxic a hydro pump and an accurate wave 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.590
 or focus basic flash inside we're going to 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 focus on hitting and not only 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.050
 hit so the beings are going to be 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.270
 spread out in special attack and hp the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.530
 nature of the mode is for the same and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.030
 I think it's understood pretty well 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.790
 many because some strategy monkeys 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.760
 similar and some variations of 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.330
 movements like dragon pulse that is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.450
 pulse dragon pump slots van scale 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.610
 climb power hidden fire and many more 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.810
 not here we have other movements like 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.980
 lightning ball shadow or impossible thunder 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.660
 dredgers just do magic of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.690
 movements but I think it's paramount 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.730
 have two movements of the same type 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.060
 that is, dragon and poison by skill 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.830
 of this adaptability 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.080
 and the other two already depends what 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.730
 you want to cover we have to shadow 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.130
 can cover psychics when a power 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.130
 hidden can cover steels and ice 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.700
 On the other hand, I think that's what 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.480
 me more I like that we have dragon pulse 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.850
 and we have pump mud scald and wave 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.959
 I like it a lot because it scalds 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.110
 It is the movement of my movements 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.150
 favorites because you can burn and then 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.940
 cetera wave although it is not so accurate 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.740
 but if it has enough power 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.950
 this is the strategy you recommend 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.380
 mogon distribute the 200 in hp and 56 in 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.150
 speed I really see that can 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.840
 win it in speed of many pokemon 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.760
 slow but I do not see the case 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.760
 for doubles we have a strategy a 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.040
 we're going to have a toxic wave or 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.800
 software and this is to cover ground 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.510
 that hits the two and with the dragon goes to 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.280
 be to get pokemon that we do not want 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.140
 that is in battle even though this 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 movement has a priority of less 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.069
 1 if I'm not wrong anyway 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.260
 dredged he is quite slow protection 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.600
 just in case and that combined with the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.000
 blacks fought the black wolf because we 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.729
 we are restoring hp every turn a 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.500
 Offensive defensive strategy 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.210
 people pretty interesting beings 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.790
 they will be focused on hp attack 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.260
 special to be bulk and make it 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.060
 support also at the same time 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.410
 On the other hand we have one that can be 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.810
 serving for singles and doubles would be 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.790
 basically the same thing but instead of surfing 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.650
 we would have scald for probability of 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.450
 burn and explosion that has more 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.100
 probability of poisoning the opponent 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.480
 you can use toxic toxins 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.910
 quite at the beginning of the battle and 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.970
 as the same battle continues only 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.070
 here the difference is that it will be very 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.660
 dared to increase its defense 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.260
 really dredged the style quite 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.090
 because those earthquakes are in 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.650
 all the equipment really is quite 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.690
 hard to see several earthquakes against the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.090
 tier then it would stay the same 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.820
 adaptability of the same object 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.130
 another change that would be merely special 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.590
 we would change and add it 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.750
 protection and the dragon pulse would be 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.880
 basically the same the same nature 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.370
 in that object 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.860
 On the other hand we can change the wave 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.930
 toxic or mud pump and we can 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.580
 put poison to poison I know that 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.790
 we have the post oxy cash but it's not 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.680
 more than having the toxic 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.020
 as another strategy or rather a 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.510
 change would be because of poison's ability 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.430
 touch this means that if they touch us 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:42.169
 can be poisoned is not so 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.960
 effective but can always serve 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.520
 like other strategies 5 and last one that is 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.409
 I also like it a lot because I 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.389
 I really like this object the jump vest 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.810
 we have the same skill and we have 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:57.319
 pulse pump mud mud scald and ball 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.599
 shadow because it covers a lot of things and 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.509
 the same is defensive because nature 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:05.240
 is forced then it can be compensated 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.860
 the special defense both defense and 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.190
 that the beings are going to be spread out in 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.560
 the same defense and hp 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.990
 good people can already only one 7.3 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.000
 over 10 to dredged because it is a pokémon 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.590
 I like it a lot but I think its 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.360
 speed is a bit of a problem I do not 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.730
 it would annoy them to have the 20 more 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.220
 so you could win some pokemon 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.350
 slow and I think it would serve more in the 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.820
 teams on the other hand in double week 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.890
 which serves quite well 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.770
 good people for this week I bring you 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.630
 6 dredge goes chinese daring and you're 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.730
 interested only leave a comment on the 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.410
 video already in the next video 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.080
 next week's strategies that 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.700
 eye is going to be from thor terra I'm going to 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.260
 advise if they won 1 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.990
 in turn I'm now raffling off the 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.670
 next pokemon 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.930

 your left that I have made them video 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.160
 On the other hand I invite you to do my 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.170
 video channel games in that which is 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.030
 appearing there is questioning you 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.830
 surprise shipping there are the networks 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.260
 social and this video that is there 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.990

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.520
 tournament against rainer a follower then yes 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.920
 you want to check it was interesting 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.260
 it was fun so nothing more than

 thank you people and see you in the 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.879
