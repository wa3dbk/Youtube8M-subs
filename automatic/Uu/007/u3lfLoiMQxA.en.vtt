00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
originally said I would might do an

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.609 
originally said I would might do an
unboxing<00:00:26.300> but<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.779> was<00:00:26.930> so<00:00:27.050> excited<00:00:27.169> when<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.560> got

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
unboxing but I was so excited when I got

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.990 
unboxing but I was so excited when I got
it<00:00:27.800> today<00:00:27.919> for<00:00:28.730> lucky<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:29.500> well<00:00:30.500> here<00:00:30.710> we<00:00:30.829> go

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
it today for lucky so well here we go

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.720 
it today for lucky so well here we go
this<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:32.180> top<00:00:32.509> here<00:00:32.810> it's<00:00:33.680> not<00:00:34.010> like<00:00:34.610> a

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
this is the top here it's not like a

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.560 
this is the top here it's not like a
glossy<00:00:35.210> finish<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.890> not<00:00:36.890> really<00:00:37.310> a<00:00:37.340> kind<00:00:38.329> of<00:00:38.450> a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
glossy finish and not really a kind of a

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.310 
glossy finish and not really a kind of a
matte<00:00:38.840> finish<00:00:39.610> it's<00:00:40.610> kind<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.390> odd<00:00:41.660> material

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
matte finish it's kind of odd material

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680 
matte finish it's kind of odd material
but<00:00:42.559> it's<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:44.210> doesn't<00:00:44.539> leave<00:00:44.660> any

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
but it's it doesn't leave any

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.180 
but it's it doesn't leave any
fingerprints<00:00:45.320> or<00:00:45.469> anything<00:00:45.649> like<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:45.920> so

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
fingerprints or anything like that so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.819 
fingerprints or anything like that so
that's<00:00:46.370> nice<00:00:46.579> currently<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:47.679> plugged<00:00:48.679> in

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
that's nice currently it's plugged in

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.939 
that's nice currently it's plugged in
but<00:00:49.219> I<00:00:49.250> think<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.579> battery's<00:00:49.940> full<00:00:50.739> it's<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.859> a

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
but I think the battery's full it's of a

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.139 
but I think the battery's full it's of a
quick<00:00:52.190> look<00:00:52.399> around<00:00:52.429> the<00:00:52.820> laptop<00:00:53.329> here<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:55.370> put

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
quick look around the laptop here so put

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.450 
quick look around the laptop here so put

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890

I originally assumed it was both but
it's<00:03:07.040> not<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.220> pushed<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> screen<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.239> you

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.140 
it's not I pushed on the screen and you
can<00:03:08.420> see<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:10.190> LCD<00:03:10.609> effect<00:03:10.940> where<00:03:11.120> you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
can see the the LCD effect where you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.509 
can see the the LCD effect where you
push<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.630> an<00:03:11.660> LCD<00:03:12.500> screen<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.220> see

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
push on an LCD screen and you can see

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.819

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
then the colors like warp around it so

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:16.750 
then the colors like warp around it so
I'm<00:03:15.889> assuming<00:03:16.130> it's<00:03:16.370> just
