and<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:41.790> where<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.329> from

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and I think that's where I get it from

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.149 
and I think that's where I get it from
and<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.350> I've<00:01:43.530> ever<00:01:43.710> been<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and because I've ever been to like a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
and because I've ever been to like a
graduation<00:01:44.460> ceremony<00:01:45.270> before<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.689> had<00:01:45.840> no<00:01:45.990> idea

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
graduation ceremony before I had no idea

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
graduation ceremony before I had no idea
what<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:48.240> took

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
what it was going to be like and it took

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
what it was going to be like and it took
an<00:01:48.570> hour<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.990> total<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.040> went<00:01:50.189> really

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
an hour in total and it went really

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280 
an hour in total and it went really
really<00:01:50.670> quickly<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> worst<00:01:51.869> thing<00:01:51.960> by<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
really quickly but the worst thing by it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
really quickly but the worst thing by it
was<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.009> stopped<00:01:53.340> behind<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.970> pole<00:01:54.299> at

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
was that I was stopped behind a pole at

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.260 
was that I was stopped behind a pole at
a<00:01:54.600> massive<00:01:54.990> pillar<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.520> could<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a massive pillar and I could not see it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.810 
a massive pillar and I could not see it
what<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> could<00:01:57.869> see<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.590> half<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> stage

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
what I could see like half of the stage

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.539 
what I could see like half of the stage
but<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.020> other<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.950> people<00:02:02.280> giving

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
but like other like my people giving

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
but like other like my people giving
speeches<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.229> most<00:02:04.380> crappiest

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
speeches it was like the most crappiest

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.280 
speeches it was like the most crappiest
view<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> was<00:02:06.810> out<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> edge

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
view and because I was out of the edge

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.260 
view and because I was out of the edge
and<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.039> thought<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.310> could<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> was

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and I thought I could see and it was

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
and I thought I could see and it was
just<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:09.660> off-putting<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.440> was<00:02:10.530> really

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
just really off-putting it was really

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.960 
just really off-putting it was really
annoying<00:02:11.039> but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
annoying but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
annoying but
I'm<00:02:12.030> actually<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.450> most<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.990> like<00:02:13.230> virtual

just graduating but wearing these shoes

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800 
just graduating but wearing these shoes
keep<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.760> mind<00:02:23.910> they're<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.240> seven<00:02:24.630> inches

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
keep in mind they're like seven inches

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.670 
keep in mind they're like seven inches
and<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:26.400> didn't<00:02:26.670> fall<00:02:26.820> over<00:02:27.180> which<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.690> amazing

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
and I am so glad I didn't fall over

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.460 
and I am so glad I didn't fall over
because<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.810> would<00:02:31.080> be<00:02:31.230> really

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
because that would be really

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
because that would be really
embarrassing<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.670> after<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.060> ceremony
