00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.000
 the advantage of which is capacious 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 battery according to official data 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.480
 However, these advantages of the phone are not

 there are some glossy ones 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.480
 elements in particular at the top end a 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.370
 also the front panel is almost on 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 metal passes around the perimeter 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.410
 insert looks like it is massive but out 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.530
 doubt adds a couple of grams to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 total weight by the way we get 119 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.879
 gram but precisely because of this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.549
 weight and body rear panel 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.830
 soft-touch coated tube 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.420
 wonderful sitting in hand and long 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.210
 continuous work with the device is not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 accompanied by discomfort 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.900
 build quality of the case itself 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 claims I have not caused quite 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.790
 good level of fit between elements 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.189
 as well as the quality of materials 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.799
 the front of the phone is divided between 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.040

 or the back panel 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.200
 which to the word is almost completely covered 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 the cover of the battery pack is available 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220

 so that the user can remove the cover 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.520

 other 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.800
 horizontal viewing angles even considering 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.290
 a small diagonal can be called 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.010
 not bad, but vertically they are lower 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.020
 middle 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.420
 while working in bright conditions 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.250
 solar lighting from conspicuous 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.590
 extinction of the displayed data 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.290
 leave will not work although consider 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.930
 data can be embedded 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.470
 user memory is small 43 8

 megabyte 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.930
 of which less than 40 33 are available 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.690
 a word like not cool but without external 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.670
 drive do not work slot 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.800
 as mentioned on the left butt a 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.000

 maximum storage capacity 32 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.900
 gigabyte important though not the only 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.360
 dignity of this phone battery 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.310
 capacity of 2000 milliampere hours 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.590
 thanks to which the tube is capable 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.290
 work up to 16 hours in mode 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.190
 talk and up to 1200 hours in mode 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.620
 expectations 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.989
 in practice, one 100% charge 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.480
 more than enough for a week with two 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.459
 hours of talk a day started working with 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.470
 Monday through the end 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.959
 sunday on battery indicator 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.330
 my philips left one division 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.760
 word if you need a handset for calls 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.150
 and this phone is a great challenger 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.610
 philips xenium x333 is equipped with two 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.709
 separate internal speakers or 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.260
 communication as well as speaker 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.330
 handsfree and first 2 show 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.010
 quite good opportunities even during 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.769
 staying in places with elevated levels 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.500
 noise and if you are in a room 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.959
 protected from external noise speaker 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.310
 hands-free is enough to 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.010
 listen to mp3 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.900
 yes there is no special volume of sound but 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.680
 after all, the device is not positioned as 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.220
 musical 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.860
 but with loudness everything is fine 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.780
 xenium x333 is equipped with a good hardware 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.090
 The keyboard is made of matte 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.610
 plastic and although it has 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.769
 glossy lining dialing process 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.989
 e.g. esemes user after 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.130
 long habituation is mistaken 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:18.560
 rarely a button stroke is good without west 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.920
 The phone menu consists of 12 sub 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.040

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.570
 work with two sim cards organized 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.290
 just enough under the setup menu 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.990
 sim cards 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.630
 There are 3 sub settings for sim-cards

 in the second, you can disable one of 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.600
 SIM cards and in the last choose 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.640
 priority calls itself from and other 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.280
 will be carried out with that sim card 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.200
 which is given priority but if 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.210
 in the process you will need to call with 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.919
 another crawl pre-menu 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.890

 a good amount of mode settings 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.470
 shooting advantage is difficult but also 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.300
 cons it is not here more likely 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.200
 neutral addition to the general 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.820
