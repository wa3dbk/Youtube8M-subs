get<00:01:50.280> rather<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.119> than<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:52.140> think

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
get rather more out of it than you think

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
get rather more out of it than you think
when<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.009> contemplate<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.939> idea<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
when you contemplate the idea of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
when you contemplate the idea of
slogging<00:01:54.540> through<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:55.140> French<00:01:55.649> Spanish

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
slogging through your French Spanish

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.649 
slogging through your French Spanish
German<00:01:56.520> whatever<00:01:57.270> homework<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> time<00:01:59.659> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
German whatever homework at the time the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
German whatever homework at the time the
second<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.140> would<00:02:01.200> say<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.619> it's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
second thing I would say is it's

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
second thing I would say is it's
a<00:02:03.090> load<00:02:03.330> languages<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.230> gets<00:02:04.500> easy<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.040> only

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
a load languages it gets easy and only

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.120 
a load languages it gets easy and only
get<00:02:06.150> easier<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.900> more<00:02:07.140> you've<00:02:07.620> got<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:08.009> them

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
get easier the more you've got of them

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.560 
get easier the more you've got of them
which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.280> where<00:02:08.520> people<00:02:08.940> tend<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.300> sort<00:02:09.420> of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
which is where people tend to sort of

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.700 
which is where people tend to sort of
speak<00:02:09.810> hardly<00:02:10.140> anymore

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
speak hardly anymore

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.590 
speak hardly anymore
after<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> while<00:02:11.460> you<00:02:11.700> find<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> quite<00:02:12.150> easy<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
after a while you find it quite easy to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.230 
after a while you find it quite easy to
learn<00:02:12.780> many<00:02:13.590> more<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.850> are<00:02:15.000> quite

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
learn many more is that they are quite

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.390 
learn many more is that they are quite
hard<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.780> think<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.220> know

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
hard and I think that you know you know

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.490 
hard and I think that you know you know
that<00:02:17.730> you're<00:02:18.540> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.020> couple<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that you're going to have a couple of

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.230 
that you're going to have a couple of
years<00:02:19.740> when<00:02:20.100> things<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.520> seem<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.030> quite

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
years when things don't seem to quite

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.860 
years when things don't seem to quite
add<00:02:21.600> up

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
add up

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.100 
add up
and<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.920> seems<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.310> quite<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.850> struggle<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:25.020> I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and it seems like quite a struggle but I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
and it seems like quite a struggle but I
would<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.440> say<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.610> worth<00:02:26.850> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
would just say that that is worth it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.400 
would just say that that is worth it
because<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.420> laying<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.750> grounding<00:02:28.290> it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
because it's laying and grounding it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.890 
because it's laying and grounding it
will<00:02:28.530> enable<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> future<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.780> learn

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
will enable you in the future to learn

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.960 
will enable you in the future to learn
much<00:02:31.140> faster<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.220> actually<00:02:32.550> also<00:02:32.700> very

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
much faster and it's actually also very

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.520 
much faster and it's actually also very
good<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.480> training<00:02:33.870> your<00:02:34.080> mind<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.380> learn

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
good for training your mind to learn

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.680 
good for training your mind to learn
other<00:02:34.890> things<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.970> wouldn't<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.360> put<00:02:36.510> off<00:02:36.630> by

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
other things so wouldn't be put off by

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.370 
other things so wouldn't be put off by
that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.800 
that
what<00:02:38.340> language<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.910> done<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.390> me<00:02:39.480> well<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> mean

it for a start they've just given me a

there's plenty of countries I go to

about other languages just doesn't make

going on around you and you will just
always<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.630> more<00:03:03.870> interesting<00:03:04.260> time<00:03:04.680> if

speak any of their language so again you
know<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.530> would<00:04:39.710> caution<00:04:39.919> against<00:04:40.729> thinking

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
know I would caution against thinking

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.330 
know I would caution against thinking
that<00:04:41.240> English<00:04:41.509> is<00:04:42.440> always<00:04:42.919> going<00:04:43.099> to<00:04:43.220> be

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
that English is always going to be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.900 
that English is always going to be
enough<00:04:43.610> I<00:04:43.789> think<00:04:44.860> multilingual<00:04:45.889> business<00:04:46.729> is

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
enough I think multilingual business is

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.659 
enough I think multilingual business is
the<00:04:47.060> future<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.800> again<00:04:48.800> most<00:04:49.099> people<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:49.520> I

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
the future and again most people that I

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.480 
the future and again most people that I
meet<00:04:49.849> of<00:04:50.210> my<00:04:50.630> own<00:04:50.780> generation<00:04:51.410> say<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:52.220> when
