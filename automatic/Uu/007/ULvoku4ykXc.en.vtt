there's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> switch<00:01:09.290> PC<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.560> TV<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
there's a switch PC or TV and I have

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
there's a switch PC or TV and I have
standard<00:01:13.260> RCA<00:01:13.409> cables<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
standard RCA cables as well as the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
standard RCA cables as well as the
s-video<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> best<00:01:16.950> possible

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
s-video so I can get the best possible

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
s-video so I can get the best possible
out<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:21.390> PVM<00:01:21.840> although<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.290> I'm

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
out of the PVM although then I'm

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
out of the PVM although then I'm
thinking<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.979> maybe<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:24.000> could<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.360> do

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
thinking like maybe I could just do

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
thinking like maybe I could just do
scart<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.320> VGA<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> don't<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.490> they

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
scart and VGA but I don't think they

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
scart and VGA but I don't think they
make<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> box<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.210> does<00:01:27.360> both<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.810> come<00:01:28.080> on

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
make a box that does both now come on

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.010 
make a box that does both now come on
let's<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.329> head<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.479> crazy<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> might<00:01:30.930> have

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
let's make my head go crazy I might have

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
let's make my head go crazy I might have
to<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.259> about<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.560> later<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.430> right<00:01:32.460> now

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to think about that later not right now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
to think about that later not right now
right<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> playing<00:01:36.860> some

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
right now all I know is so playing some

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.270 
right now all I know is so playing some
plasma<00:01:38.040> sword<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.840> mean<00:01:40.770> can't<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.100> tell

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
plasma sword I mean can't really tell

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.499 
plasma sword I mean can't really tell
but<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> actually<00:01:41.820> s-video<00:01:42.420> looks<00:01:42.840> good<00:01:44.509> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
but it actually s-video looks good it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.870 
but it actually s-video looks good it
does<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.430> obviously<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.520> can't<00:01:47.790> really

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
does and obviously I can't really

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.870 
does and obviously I can't really
concentrate<00:01:48.659> playing<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
now what's cool about this thing I got

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.320 
now what's cool about this thing I got
at<00:03:05.640> RadioShack

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
at RadioShack

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.820 
at RadioShack
and<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.080> little<00:03:07.230> volume<00:03:07.560> switch

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
and this is like a little volume switch

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160 
and this is like a little volume switch
is<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.549> also<00:03:08.700> has<00:03:09.030> headphones<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.959> has<00:03:10.080> this

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
is it also has headphones it has this

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.509 
is it also has headphones it has this
auxilary<00:03:10.590> that's<00:03:10.890> where<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.160> putting<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
auxilary that's where I'm putting the

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.199 
auxilary that's where I'm putting the
RCA<00:03:11.820> audio<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.540> also<00:03:12.690> has<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.880> standard<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.060> guess

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
RCA audio it also has a standard I guess

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.289 
RCA audio it also has a standard I guess
what<00:03:15.500> computer<00:03:16.500> line<00:03:16.769> cable<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.610> don't<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.180> don't

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
what computer line cable I don't I don't

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.210 
what computer line cable I don't I don't
know<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.600> call<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.860> goes<00:03:20.040> in

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
know what you call it but that goes in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.050 
know what you call it but that goes in
the<00:03:20.310> back<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.700> TV<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.330> into<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.320> VGA<00:03:22.709> box

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the back of the TV and into the VGA box

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.560 
the back of the TV and into the VGA box
so<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.519> have<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.790> work<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
so I can just have it work out of the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.600 
so I can just have it work out of the
box<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.320> let's<00:03:29.150> turn<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.390> son<00:03:32.120> okay<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:34.610> forgot

that<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.210> actually<00:04:29.590> used<00:04:30.590> a<00:04:30.920> VGA<00:04:31.910> for<00:04:32.000> the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
that I actually used a VGA for the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.370 
that I actually used a VGA for the
Dreamcast<00:04:32.540> but<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.660> never<00:04:32.810> touched<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.200> had

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
Dreamcast but I never touched it I had

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.560 
Dreamcast but I never touched it I had
the<00:04:33.590> Box<00:04:34.160> never<00:04:34.400> really<00:04:34.730> used<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> couldn't

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
the Box never really used it I couldn't

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.390 
the Box never really used it I couldn't
even<00:04:35.630> get<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:35.990> work<00:04:36.200> on<00:04:36.440> my<00:04:37.180> HD<00:04:38.180> my<00:04:39.170> LCD<00:04:39.800> back

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400

in<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.640> day<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.790> don't<00:04:40.880> know<00:04:41.030> why<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.320> thought

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
in the day I don't know why so I thought

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.810 
in the day I don't know why so I thought
it<00:04:42.620> was<00:04:42.680> just<00:04:42.770> broken<00:04:43.220> until<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.430> tested<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.760> on

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
it was just broken until I tested it on

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.280 
it was just broken until I tested it on
this<00:04:43.970> network<00:04:44.210> what's<00:04:44.810> cool<00:04:44.960> about<00:04:44.990> this

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
this network what's cool about this

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.990 
this network what's cool about this
monitor<00:04:46.420> is<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:48.320> also<00:04:48.470> has<00:04:48.740> two<00:04:49.010> VGA<00:04:49.460> ports<00:04:49.910> so

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
monitor is it also has two VGA ports so

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.490 
monitor is it also has two VGA ports so
I<00:04:50.060> could<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.420> something<00:04:50.840> else<00:04:50.930> I'm<00:04:51.170> wanting<00:04:51.410> to
