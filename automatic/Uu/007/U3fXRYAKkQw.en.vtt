00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
interesting thing she said it's going to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.529 
interesting thing she said it's going to
be<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> short<00:00:53.399> video<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.149> interesting

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
be a short video but one interesting

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.790 
be a short video but one interesting
thing<00:00:54.570> she<00:00:54.809> said<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.230> she<00:00:55.410> doesn't

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
thing she said was that she doesn't

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.380

think<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.180> RS<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.129> she<00:00:59.129> thinks<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.000> could<00:01:00.239> be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
think it was RS I she thinks it could be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
think it was RS I she thinks it could be
something<00:01:00.600> else<00:01:00.920> she<00:01:01.920> doesn't<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.219> quite

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
something else she doesn't know quite

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.729 
something else she doesn't know quite
what<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.059> she<00:01:03.239> says<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.899> symptoms<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
what but she says that the symptoms and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.910 
what but she says that the symptoms and
the<00:01:05.339> timings<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.689> areas<00:01:07.170> such<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the timings and the areas such as the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.179 
the timings and the areas such as the
shoulder<00:01:08.250> etc<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:09.180> necessarily<00:01:09.840> match<00:01:10.189> RSI

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
shoulder etc don't necessarily match RSI

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.880 
shoulder etc don't necessarily match RSI
it<00:01:11.400> could<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> probably<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it could be but it's probably not so
