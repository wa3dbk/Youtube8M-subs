00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
through it see if I can figure it out

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.470 
through it see if I can figure it out
and<00:02:47.349> we'll<00:02:48.159> come<00:02:48.790> back<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:48.970> take<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> look<00:02:49.269> at

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and we'll come back and take a look at

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:49.760 
and we'll come back and take a look at
it

either I folded it the wrong way or
they're<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.260> extra<00:04:13.830> I'm<00:04:13.950> not<00:04:14.130> sure<00:04:15.709> when<00:04:16.709> you

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
they're just extra I'm not sure when you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.100

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
to hold the drawer together a little bit

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.030 
to hold the drawer together a little bit
better<00:04:26.820> but<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.840> slides<00:04:28.140> nice<00:04:28.440> once<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:28.860> in

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
better but it slides nice once it's in

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.000 
better but it slides nice once it's in
and<00:04:29.720> they<00:04:30.720> definitely<00:04:30.870> stay<00:04:31.290> secure<00:04:31.740> or<00:04:31.890> you

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
and they definitely stay secure or you

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.860 
and they definitely stay secure or you
can<00:04:32.160> just<00:04:32.390> leave<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.450> like<00:04:33.630> that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
can just leave it like that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.310 
can just leave it like that
grab<00:04:34.500> your<00:04:34.650> stuff<00:04:34.860> out<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.190> there<00:04:36.170> all<00:04:37.170> right

grab your stuff out of there all right
oh<00:04:37.590> that's<00:04:37.800> probably<00:04:38.070> part<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.610> there

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
oh that's probably part of it there

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.150 
oh that's probably part of it there
wasn't<00:04:39.540> sealing<00:04:39.840> right<00:04:39.990> but<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.680> put<00:04:41.040> these

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
wasn't sealing right but you put these

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.740 
wasn't sealing right but you put these
boxes<00:04:41.400> together<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:42.180> your<00:04:42.330> own<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.630> then

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
boxes together on your own and then

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.690 
boxes together on your own and then
there's<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.960> big<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.410> on<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.620> bottom<00:04:43.950> where

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
there's a big one on the bottom where

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.210 
there's a big one on the bottom where
you<00:04:44.730> can<00:04:44.820> drop<00:04:45.150> your<00:04:45.360> whole<00:04:45.510> kit<00:04:45.840> or<00:04:46.770> probably

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
you can drop your whole kit or probably

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.840 
you can drop your whole kit or probably
you<00:04:48.210> know<00:04:48.330> two<00:04:48.660> ways<00:04:48.870> tents<00:04:49.440> kill<00:04:49.680> buggies<00:04:50.670> are

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
you know two ways tents kill buggies are

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.100 
you know two ways tents kill buggies are
definitely<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.300> short<00:04:51.510> course<00:04:51.690> truck<00:04:51.720> wouldn't

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
definitely a short course truck wouldn't

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.700 
definitely a short course truck wouldn't
fit<00:04:52.200> down<00:04:52.230> there<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:54.200> I'm<00:04:55.200> gonna<00:04:55.350> look<00:04:55.560> at

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
fit down there so I'm gonna look at

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.560 
fit down there so I'm gonna look at
securing<00:04:56.460> these<00:04:56.550> drawers<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.060> little<00:04:57.450> bit

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
securing these drawers a little bit

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.810 
securing these drawers a little bit
better<00:04:57.750> I'm<00:04:58.230> not<00:04:58.290> sure<00:04:58.680> what<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.160> did<00:04:59.250> wrong<00:04:59.550> but

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
better I'm not sure what I did wrong but

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.370 
better I'm not sure what I did wrong but
it<00:04:59.940> doesn't<00:05:00.240> seem<00:05:00.360> like<00:05:00.600> these<00:05:00.750> stickers<00:05:01.080> are

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
it doesn't seem like these stickers are

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.670 
it doesn't seem like these stickers are
the<00:05:02.190> car<00:05:02.430> birds<00:05:02.610> almost<00:05:02.880> like<00:05:03.030> too<00:05:03.270> rigid<00:05:06.680> but

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
the car birds almost like too rigid but

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.680 
the car birds almost like too rigid but
I<00:05:08.810> could<00:05:09.810> have<00:05:09.900> also<00:05:10.050> put<00:05:10.410> together<00:05:10.560> on<00:05:10.920> two

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
I could have also put together on two

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.540 
I could have also put together on two
zippers<00:05:12.690> up<00:05:12.840> real<00:05:13.110> nice<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.920> a<00:05:14.070> cube<00:05:14.400> of

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
zippers up real nice in a cube of

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.330 
zippers up real nice in a cube of
Awesomeness<00:05:15.710> one<00:05:16.710> thing<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.950> will<00:05:17.070> say<00:05:17.100> is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
Awesomeness one thing I will say is

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.520 
Awesomeness one thing I will say is
everything<00:05:17.820> fits<00:05:18.030> real<00:05:18.240> snug<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:19.050> don't<00:05:19.470> know

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
everything fits real snug I don't know

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.340 
everything fits real snug I don't know
how<00:05:19.650> long<00:05:19.800> that's<00:05:20.070> gonna<00:05:20.190> last<00:05:20.310> hopefully

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
how long that's gonna last hopefully

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.700 
how long that's gonna last hopefully
hopefully<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.620> very<00:05:22.680> long<00:05:23.010> time<00:05:24.380> just<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.680> know

hopefully a very long time just you know

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.840 
hopefully a very long time just you know
you<00:05:25.860> don't<00:05:25.980> want<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.310> swap<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.670> around

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
you don't want to swap it around

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.960 
you don't want to swap it around

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
come up a little bit

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.190 
come up a little bit
there<00:05:38.390> we<00:05:38.480> go<00:05:39.580> all<00:05:40.580> right<00:05:40.670> so<00:05:41.120> once<00:05:41.870> you've<00:05:42.050> got

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200

there we go all right so once you've got
it<00:05:42.350> all<00:05:42.470> closed<00:05:42.800> up<00:05:43.840> got<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.870> nice<00:05:45.050> cube<00:05:45.700> of

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
it all closed up got a nice cube of
