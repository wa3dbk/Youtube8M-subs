00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
me to benchmark i would try like i said

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.349 
me to benchmark i would try like i said
i<00:03:31.329> am<00:03:31.480> going<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.720> add<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.870> third<00:03:32.230> gtx<00:03:32.829> 285<00:03:33.359> to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
i am going to add a third gtx 285 to

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.650 
i am going to add a third gtx 285 to
this<00:03:35.310> before<00:03:36.310> sup<00:03:36.730> grade<00:03:36.970> this<00:03:37.180> I'll<00:03:37.420> take

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
this before sup grade this I'll take

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.410 
this before sup grade this I'll take
this<00:03:37.780> power<00:03:38.019> supply<00:03:38.380> hand<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.739> three

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
this power supply hand to three

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.140 
this power supply hand to three
so<00:03:40.319> that's<00:03:40.530> probably<00:03:41.280> my<00:03:41.490> place<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.030> this

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
so that's probably my place for this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.900 
so that's probably my place for this
year<00:03:42.450> sometime<00:03:43.140> probably<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.739> late<00:03:44.580> summer

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
