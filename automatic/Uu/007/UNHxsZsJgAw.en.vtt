00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
think they're deep enough I know they

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
think they're deep enough I know they
want<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> run<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> end<00:00:47.879> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
want to run right now and at the end of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729 
want to run right now and at the end of
the<00:00:48.210> day<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.629> think<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> Eastern<00:00:49.559> Conference

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the day I think the Eastern Conference

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.889 
the day I think the Eastern Conference
Finals<00:00:50.399> comes<00:00:50.610> down<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> miami<00:00:51.510> heat<00:00:51.690> in

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
Finals comes down to the miami heat in

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
Finals comes down to the miami heat in
the<00:00:52.260> chicago<00:00:52.770> bulls<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.340> basically<00:00:54.000> whether

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the chicago bulls and basically whether

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.229 
the chicago bulls and basically whether
or<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.809> direct<00:00:55.320> rolls<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.829> healthy<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.460> really

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
or not direct rolls is healthy I really

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
or not direct rolls is healthy I really
think<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.840> Chicago<00:00:58.350> Bulls<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> huge

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
think the Chicago Bulls have a huge

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
think the Chicago Bulls have a huge
opportunity<00:00:59.520> to<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.660> finals<00:01:01.079> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
opportunity to go to the finals this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.080 
opportunity to go to the finals this
year<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:02.129> they're<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> most<00:01:02.489> complete

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
year I think they're the most complete

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
year I think they're the most complete
team<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> NBA<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.409> especially<00:01:05.040> if
