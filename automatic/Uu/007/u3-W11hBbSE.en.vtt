00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.240 
to be perfect other than that
let's<00:00:56.100> begin<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.969> Rooney's<00:00:57.559> advantages<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
let's begin with Rooney's advantages so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.380 
let's begin with Rooney's advantages so
he<00:00:59.850> has<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.750> most<00:01:00.989> amazing

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
he has one of the most amazing

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
he has one of the most amazing
overpowered<00:01:03.390> long<00:01:03.989> shots<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:05.040> ever<00:01:05.309> seen

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
overpowered long shots I have ever seen

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.149 
overpowered long shots I have ever seen
an<00:01:05.790> ultimate<00:01:06.330> team<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> guess<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:07.979> what

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
an ultimate team but I guess that's what

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.969 
an ultimate team but I guess that's what
you<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> 99<00:01:09.619> shot<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you get when you have a 99 shot on the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:11.450 
you get when you have a 99 shot on the
card

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
card

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.200 
card
another<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.630> his<00:01:13.080> shock<00:01:13.439> power<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
another thing is his shock power is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.609

would say his his stats in games that
say<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.920> 97<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.910> game<00:02:09.239> strength<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
say I think 97 in game strength but I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.950 
say I think 97 in game strength but I
really<00:02:10.950> doubt<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.250> guys<00:02:11.720> I've<00:02:12.720> tried<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.440> can

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
really doubt it guys I've tried I can

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.710 
really doubt it guys I've tried I can
phenoix<00:02:14.380> he<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.100> much<00:02:15.550> stronger<00:02:16.000> than<00:02:16.210> rooney

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
phenoix he is much stronger than rooney

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.550 
phenoix he is much stronger than rooney
much<00:02:17.080> stronger<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.420> forte<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.660> well<00:02:19.930> he<00:02:20.380> is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
much stronger and forte as well he is

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.270 
much stronger and forte as well he is
much<00:02:20.920> stronger<00:02:21.340> than<00:02:21.520> Rooney<00:02:22.180> also<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.980> those

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
much stronger than Rooney also but those

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.690 
much stronger than Rooney also but those
two<00:02:24.580> guys<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:25.800> 99<00:02:26.800> strength<00:02:27.220> while<00:02:27.460> Rooney

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
two guys have 99 strength while Rooney

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.990 
two guys have 99 strength while Rooney
have<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:28.330> has<00:02:28.480> 97<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:30.070> have<00:02:30.310> it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
have I think has 97 but they have it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.350 
have I think has 97 but they have it
shows<00:02:31.240> such<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> huge<00:02:32.860> difference<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.670> can't<00:02:34.180> see

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
shows such a huge difference I can't see

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780 
shows such a huge difference I can't see
how<00:02:34.510> two<00:02:34.570> points<00:02:35.260> could<00:02:35.470> make<00:02:35.680> Rooney<00:02:36.040> look<00:02:36.190> so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
how two points could make Rooney look so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.440 
how two points could make Rooney look so
much<00:02:37.060> weaker<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:37.720> that's<00:02:38.230> how<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.770> guys

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
much weaker but that's how it is guys

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.650 
much weaker but that's how it is guys
other<00:02:40.450> than<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.290> think<00:02:41.970> Rooney<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> good

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
other than that I think Rooney is a good

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.120 
other than that I think Rooney is a good
player<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.460> couple<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.060> more

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
player but there is a couple of more

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.040 
player but there is a couple of more
disadvantages<00:02:48.130> such<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:48.910> how<00:02:49.420> he's<00:02:49.690> out<00:02:49.990> of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
disadvantages such as how he's out of

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.040 
disadvantages such as how he's out of
position<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:52.630> time

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
position all the time

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.650 
position all the time
I<00:02:53.350> mean<00:02:53.890> seriously<00:02:54.190> because<00:02:54.970> his<00:02:55.120> high<00:02:55.360> work

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
I mean seriously because his high work

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.410 
I mean seriously because his high work
rate<00:02:55.960> defensively<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.010> attacking<00:02:57.460> wise<00:02:57.790> he

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
rate defensively and attacking wise he

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.980 
rate defensively and attacking wise he
is<00:02:58.660> always<00:02:58.990> our<00:02:59.500> position<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.030> recommend<00:03:01.810> if

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
is always our position so I recommend if

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.590 
is always our position so I recommend if
you're<00:03:02.200> gonna<00:03:02.350> buy<00:03:02.650> Rooney<00:03:03.520> team<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.360> year

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
you're gonna buy Rooney team of the year

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.810 
you're gonna buy Rooney team of the year
or<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:05.350> not<00:03:05.560> sure<00:03:05.710> about<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.250> normal<00:03:06.640> rule

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
or I'm not sure about the normal rule

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.290 
or I'm not sure about the normal rule
you<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.090> he<00:03:07.180> has<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.480> same<00:03:07.660> work<00:03:07.930> rates<00:03:08.230> he<00:03:08.950> is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
you if he has the same work rates he is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.600 
you if he has the same work rates he is
ideal<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.630> be<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:10.990> center<00:03:11.500> forward<00:03:11.980> guys<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
ideal to be in center forward guys I

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.250 
ideal to be in center forward guys I
wouldn't<00:03:13.030> put<00:03:13.330> him<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.510> strike<00:03:13.810> because<00:03:14.080> he's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
wouldn't put him in strike because he's

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.600 
wouldn't put him in strike because he's
always<00:03:14.500> too<00:03:15.100> behind<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.970> would<00:03:16.390> see<00:03:16.750> my
