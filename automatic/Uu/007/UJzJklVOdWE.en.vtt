also thought why not do galine because I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.630 
also thought why not do galine because I
think<00:00:20.689> they<00:00:20.930> have<00:00:21.080> kind<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:21.349> a<00:00:21.439> similar<00:00:21.640> color

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
think they have kind of a similar color

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.330 
think they have kind of a similar color
and<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:22.939> just<00:00:23.329> so<00:00:23.480> happen<00:00:23.869> of<00:00:24.169> Ellis<00:00:24.890> here<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:25.279> I

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
and I just so happen of Ellis here so I

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.030 
and I just so happen of Ellis here so I
thought<00:00:26.020> might<00:00:27.020> be<00:00:27.169> kind<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.439> cool<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.680> see<00:00:27.919> the

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
thought might be kind of cool to see the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.920 
thought might be kind of cool to see the
two<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.220> them<00:00:28.460> in<00:00:28.579> the<00:00:28.700> same<00:00:28.939> shot<00:00:29.540> since

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
two of them in the same shot since

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.760

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
they're both kind of gray and silver so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.810

I mean who thought of this more beads
more<00:03:30.620> stuff<00:03:30.890> going<00:03:31.190> on<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.600> pretty<00:03:32.840> elaborate

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
more stuff going on so pretty elaborate

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.470

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:44.879 
super unique you can tell that the

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.999 
super unique you can tell that the
designers<00:05:45.360> put<00:05:45.659> a<00:05:45.959> lot<00:05:46.379> of<00:05:46.499> thought<00:05:46.769> and

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
designers put a lot of thought and

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.439 
designers put a lot of thought and
effort<00:05:47.189> into<00:05:47.430> designing<00:05:48.120> this<00:05:48.330> doll<00:05:50.419> so<00:05:51.419> I

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
effort into designing this doll so I

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.739 
effort into designing this doll so I
think<00:05:51.599> that<00:05:52.050> going<00:05:52.759> doesn't<00:05:53.759> get<00:05:53.969> a<00:05:53.999> lot<00:05:54.419> of

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:54.749 
think that going doesn't get a lot of

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.549 
think that going doesn't get a lot of
attention<00:05:56.089> because<00:05:57.089> I<00:05:57.120> think<00:05:57.689> at<00:05:57.779> the<00:05:57.899> time<00:05:58.080> a

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 
attention because I think at the time a

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.790 
attention because I think at the time a
lot<00:05:58.889> of<00:05:59.069> dolls<00:05:59.930> were<00:06:00.930> released<00:06:01.499> at<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.769> same
