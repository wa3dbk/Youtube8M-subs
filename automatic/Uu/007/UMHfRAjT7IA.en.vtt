00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
four because I do love the way that you

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.279 
four because I do love the way that you
can<00:04:58.310> modify<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:58.940> dress<00:04:59.510> you<00:04:59.930> could<00:05:00.050> really

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
can modify this dress you could really

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:01.810 
can modify this dress you could really
modify<00:05:00.560> any<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.010> princess<00:05:01.340> dresses<00:05:01.550> but

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
modify any of the princess dresses but

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.279 
modify any of the princess dresses but
really<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.360> one<00:05:02.539> that<00:05:02.720> takes<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.199> the

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
really this is the one that takes it the

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.439 
really this is the one that takes it the
best<00:05:03.500> because<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.280> think<00:05:04.340> yellow<00:05:04.639> is<00:05:04.909> such<00:05:05.180> an

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
best because I think yellow is such an

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.390 
best because I think yellow is such an
abrasive<00:05:05.780> color<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:06.800> have<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.250> do

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
abrasive color that you have to do

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.370 
abrasive color that you have to do
something<00:05:07.639> to<00:05:07.820> tone<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.060> down<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.990> was<00:05:09.050> so

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
something to tone it down and it was so

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.589 
something to tone it down and it was so
much<00:05:09.650> yellow<00:05:10.099> than<00:05:10.280> just<00:05:10.610> bright<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:11.360> like

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
much yellow than just bright so I like

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.240 
much yellow than just bright so I like
how<00:05:11.780> much<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.020> can<00:05:12.169> modify<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:12.590> dress<00:05:12.979> and

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
how much you can modify this dress and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.800 
how much you can modify this dress and
it<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:13.490> accentuates<00:05:14.000> that<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.570> makes<00:05:14.690> it

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
it just accentuates that it makes it

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.969 
it just accentuates that it makes it
look<00:05:14.900> so<00:05:14.930> pretty

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
look so pretty

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.790 
look so pretty
like<00:05:16.250> this<00:05:16.520> is<00:05:16.699> probably<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.270> best<00:05:17.800> Disney

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
concerned and that's really the only

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.860 
concerned and that's really the only
