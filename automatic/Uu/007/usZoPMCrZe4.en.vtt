00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.590 
complex gameplay put together hopefully
a<00:01:33.380> reasonable<00:01:34.380> happen<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> habitat<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.450> just

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a reasonable happen to habitat as i just

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
a reasonable happen to habitat as i just
have<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:36.840> fun<00:01:36.960> firing<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.680> engine

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
have some fun firing off this engine

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
have some fun firing off this engine
here<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.450> by<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> end<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> three

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
here then so by the end of three

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
here then so by the end of three
episodes<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.920> make<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.250> good

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
episodes you and make a pretty good

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
episodes you and make a pretty good
decision<00:01:41.700> about<00:01:41.850> backing<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.960> backing<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
decision about backing or not backing so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
decision about backing or not backing so
what<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> hell<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> habitat<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.909> going

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
what the hell is habitat what is going

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
what the hell is habitat what is going
on<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.479> arms<00:01:45.689> good<00:01:45.869> i<00:01:46.079> need<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
on your arms good i need to go to this

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
on your arms good i need to go to this
mode<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.700> i'm<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> fly<00:01:49.170> around<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
mode and i'm going to fly around this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
mode and i'm going to fly around this
this<00:01:50.640> asteroid<00:01:51.090> fields<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> ever<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
this asteroid fields you ever this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.630 
this asteroid fields you ever this
debris<00:01:52.409> filter<00:01:52.920> i'll<00:01:53.070> look<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> Eiffel

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
debris filter i'll look it's the Eiffel

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.240 
debris filter i'll look it's the Eiffel
Tower<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.720> fantastic<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.439> am<00:01:55.560> orbiting<00:01:55.920> the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
left is the Empire State Building that's
good<00:02:02.460> there's<00:02:02.759> something<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.390> may<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.540> used

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
good there's something that may be used

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.389 
good there's something that may be used

rocket<00:02:26.740> interest<00:02:27.740> open<00:02:28.640> your<00:02:28.760> habitat<00:02:29.210> anyway

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
rocket interest open your habitat anyway

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.420 
rocket interest open your habitat anyway
so<00:02:29.600> what's<00:02:29.840> going<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.410> am<00:02:30.890> building<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
so what's going on here I am building a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.700 
so what's going on here I am building a
habitat<00:02:31.820> I've<00:02:31.910> got<00:02:32.060> engineers<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.500> can

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
habitat I've got engineers that I can

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.280 
habitat I've got engineers that I can
use<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.980> put<00:02:34.460> things<00:02:34.730> together<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.570> my<00:02:35.810> habitat

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
use to put things together on my habitat

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.870 
use to put things together on my habitat
to<00:02:36.740> create<00:02:37.160> something<00:02:37.190> approaching

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
to create something approaching

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.030 
to create something approaching
something<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.960> people<00:02:39.260> might<00:02:39.380> actually<00:02:39.680> be

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
something that people might actually be

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.660 
something that people might actually be
able<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.400> live<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.850> at<00:02:41.270> some<00:02:41.540> point<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:43.610> I

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
able to live on at some point and then I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.880 
able to live on at some point and then I
can<00:02:43.820> fly<00:02:44.060> around<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.690> habitat<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
can fly around in that habitat it's a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.680 
can fly around in that habitat it's a
newtonian<00:02:46.490> physics<00:02:46.640> system<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.240> 2d<00:02:47.660> plane

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
newtonian physics system in a 2d plane

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.380 
newtonian physics system in a 2d plane
it's<00:02:48.230> very<00:02:48.530> cool<00:02:48.920> feels<00:02:49.310> very<00:02:49.580> responsive<00:02:50.270> and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
it's very cool feels very responsive and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.690 
it's very cool feels very responsive and
return<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> into<00:02:51.080> living<00:02:51.290> space<00:02:55.240> listen<00:02:56.240> to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
return that into living space listen to

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.229 
return that into living space listen to
food<00:02:58.480> product<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.489> can<00:03:00.610> fly<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.910> happens

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
food product so you can fly to happens

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.089 
food product so you can fly to happens
around<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.930> will<00:03:02.019> load<00:03:02.170> its<00:03:02.530> newtonian

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
around it will load its newtonian

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.979 
around it will load its newtonian
physics<00:03:03.250> simulations<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.269> if<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.629> build<00:03:04.900> it

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
physics simulations so if you build it

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.210 
physics simulations so if you build it
in<00:03:05.110> different<00:03:05.260> ways<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.709> will<00:03:05.800> fly<00:03:06.069> in

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
in different ways that will fly in

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.410 
in different ways that will fly in
different<00:03:06.519> ways<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.819> will<00:03:06.910> respond<00:03:07.300> to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
different ways that will respond to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.540 
different ways that will respond to
being<00:03:07.569> crashed<00:03:07.930> into<00:03:08.200> things<00:03:08.560> quiet<00:03:09.340> look

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
being crashed into things quiet look

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820 
being crashed into things quiet look
I'll<00:03:09.670> FLOTUS<00:03:10.060> right<00:03:10.300> now<00:03:10.450> I'm<00:03:11.200> gonna<00:03:11.260> fly<00:03:11.620> my

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
I'll FLOTUS right now I'm gonna fly my

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.410 
I'll FLOTUS right now I'm gonna fly my
habitat<00:03:12.190> turn<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.550> engines<00:03:12.879> one<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.120> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
habitat turn on engines one and to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.259 
habitat turn on engines one and to
accelerate<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.620> little<00:03:14.890> bit<00:03:15.010> up<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.550> now<00:03:16.000> I'm

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269
