00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.140 
guys are amazing but this video is also
really<00:00:24.300> important<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.910> been<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
really important because it's been a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.750 
really important because it's been a
year<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.660> still<00:00:27.689> haven't<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.699> sort<00:00:29.699> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
year and I still haven't really sort of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.959 
year and I still haven't really sort of
declared<00:00:30.679> what<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.830> channel<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.730> about

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
declared what my channel is really about

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.450 
declared what my channel is really about
and<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:34.380> reason<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.130> because<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and the reason for that is because I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.450 
and the reason for that is because I
frankly<00:00:35.940> didn't<00:00:36.360> know<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.250> recently<00:00:38.250> I've

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
frankly didn't know and recently I've

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.190 
frankly didn't know and recently I've
been<00:00:38.640> thinking<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:41.100> have

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
been thinking about it a lot and I have

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
been thinking about it a lot and I have
finally<00:00:43.200> decided<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.610> whole<00:00:44.789> video<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
finally decided that my whole video is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.130 
finally decided that my whole video is
to<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:46.020> cubers<00:00:46.860> um<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:49.829> sub<00:00:50.039> 20<00:00:50.809> level<00:00:51.809> because

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to get cubers um to sub 20 level because

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
to get cubers um to sub 20 level because
that's<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> path<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.039> took<00:00:53.360> when<00:00:54.360> i

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that's kind of the path I took when i

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
that's kind of the path I took when i
started<00:00:54.780> youtube<00:00:54.989> i<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.739> 33<00:00:56.399> seconds

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
and it basically took like nine months
off<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> cubic<00:01:01.379> no<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.879> it<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.149> 10<00:01:03.300> or

finally<00:01:12.900> am<00:01:12.930> sub-20<00:01:13.500> i<00:01:13.799> averaged<00:01:14.189> around<00:01:14.310> 18

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
finally am sub-20 i averaged around 18

or<00:01:15.210> 19<00:01:15.830> consistently<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:18.170> my<00:01:19.170> whole<00:01:19.460> goal<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
or 19 consistently so my whole goal is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.200 
or 19 consistently so my whole goal is
to<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.900> people<00:01:22.170> who<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.390> around<00:01:24.390> 40<00:01:24.930> seconds

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
to get people who are around 40 seconds

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
to all the way down to 20 seconds and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670 
to all the way down to 20 seconds and
hopefully<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.689> CFO<00:01:34.170> p<00:01:34.350> method

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
hopefully you know the CFO p method

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.480 
hopefully you know the CFO p method
because<00:01:35.810> that's<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.110> my<00:01:37.320> tutorials<00:01:38.159> are

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
because that's what my tutorials are

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.590 
because that's what my tutorials are
going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.880> based<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.329> kind

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
going to be based on and so that's kind

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830 
going to be based on and so that's kind
of<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.750> declaration<00:01:43.320> basically<00:01:44.310> odds<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.689> get

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

YouTube<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.730> reason<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.240> because

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
YouTube and the reason is just because

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.440 
YouTube and the reason is just because
it's<00:02:29.020> faster<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.620> easier<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:31.270> more

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
it's faster it's easier it's more

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.850 
it's faster it's easier it's more
accessible<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:32.080> me<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.520> that's<00:02:34.150> why<00:02:35.910> see<00:02:37.860> next

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
accessible for me so that's why see next

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.900 
accessible for me so that's why see next
I<00:02:39.670> would<00:02:40.300> say<00:02:40.480> my<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.920> haven't<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.880> should

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
I would say my if you haven't you should

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.070 
I would say my if you haven't you should
visit<00:02:43.210> my<00:02:43.510> channel<00:02:44.130> why<00:02:45.130> because<00:02:45.970> I've<00:02:46.660> made

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
visit my channel why because I've made

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.100 
visit my channel why because I've made
some<00:02:47.260> changes<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.450> most<00:02:49.630> important

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
some changes to it the most important

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.910 
some changes to it the most important
really<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.890> i<00:02:52.020> added<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.110> pull<00:02:53.320> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
really is that i added a pull the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680 
really is that i added a pull the
polling<00:02:54.220> system<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.670> google<00:02:55.030> moderator<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
polling system the google moderator and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.720 
polling system the google moderator and
the<00:02:56.410> reason<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.710> did<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.040> because<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.490> feel

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
the reason I did that is because I feel

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.610 
the reason I did that is because I feel
like<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.420> videos<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.840> make<00:02:59.050> are<00:02:59.260> really

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
like the videos I make are really

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.280 
like the videos I make are really
selfish<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.670> know<00:03:00.700> their<00:03:01.060> tutorials<00:03:01.750> but

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
selfish you know their tutorials but

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.290 
selfish you know their tutorials but
they're<00:03:02.560> really<00:03:02.680> because<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.370> want<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.090> make

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
they're really because I want to make

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.700 
they're really because I want to make
them<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.600> not<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.230> people<00:03:05.620> actually

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
them and not because people actually

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.850 
them and not because people actually
want<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.160> view<00:03:06.640> them<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.200> think<00:03:08.440> it'd<00:03:08.830> be

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
want to view them and so I think it'd be

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.310 
want to view them and so I think it'd be
a<00:03:09.070> lot<00:03:09.310> more<00:03:09.660> would<00:03:10.660> be<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.780> better<00:03:10.930> use<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.200> my

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
a lot more would be a better use of my

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.970 
a lot more would be a better use of my
time<00:03:11.620> if<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.910> guys<00:03:13.210> actually<00:03:13.739> went<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
time if you guys actually went to the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.180 
time if you guys actually went to the
pole<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.230> wrote<00:03:17.230> down<00:03:17.440> your<00:03:17.620> suggestions<00:03:18.190> and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
pole and wrote down your suggestions and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.250 
pole and wrote down your suggestions and
let<00:03:19.000> people<00:03:19.270> vote<00:03:19.300> because<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.900> feel<00:03:20.230> like

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
let people vote because I feel like

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.110 
let people vote because I feel like
that's<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.040> only<00:03:21.070> way<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.520> really<00:03:21.880> reach

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
that's the only way I can really reach

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.590 
that's the only way I can really reach
out<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.540> guys<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:24.060> make<00:03:25.060> videos<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.420> what

make right now I have a couple video
suggestions<00:03:31.209> actually<00:03:31.780> request<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.890> um<00:03:33.190> I

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
suggestions actually request that um I

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.820 
suggestions actually request that um I
will<00:03:33.970> do<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.520> that<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:37.230> how<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.410> faster

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
will do one of that is how to get faster

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.180 
will do one of that is how to get faster
at<00:03:38.890> f2l<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.350> interestingly<00:03:41.350> enough<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:42.040> was

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
at f2l and interestingly enough I was

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.140 
at f2l and interestingly enough I was
actually<00:03:42.310> thinking<00:03:42.459> about<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.940> while<00:03:43.090> ago

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
actually thinking about this a while ago

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.360 
actually thinking about this a while ago
as<00:03:43.540> well<00:03:43.720> i<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:44.709> i'm<00:03:44.950> actually<00:03:45.070> going<00:03:45.280> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
as well i think i'm actually going to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.680 
as well i think i'm actually going to
make<00:03:45.489> an<00:03:45.580> f<00:03:45.700> 12<00:03:45.910> series<00:03:46.239> because<00:03:47.100> right<00:03:48.100> now<00:03:48.130> I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
make an f 12 series because right now I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.150 
make an f 12 series because right now I
feel<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:49.900> f<00:03:50.140> 2<00:03:50.350> l's<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.590> most<00:03:50.769> important

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
feel like f 2 l's the most important

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.210 
feel like f 2 l's the most important
part<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.370> anyone<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.030> sub<00:03:52.239> 20<00:03:52.540> or<00:03:53.230> sub<00:03:54.010> 30

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
part for anyone to get sub 20 or sub 30

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.130 
part for anyone to get sub 20 or sub 30
because<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.450> most<00:03:56.760> dynamic<00:03:57.930> step<00:03:58.930> of

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
because it's the most dynamic step of

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.810 
because it's the most dynamic step of
CFO<00:03:59.680> p<00:04:00.570> p<00:04:01.570> 0<00:04:01.600> 0<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:02.140> PLL<00:04:02.620> are<00:04:02.769> important<00:04:03.250> but

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
CFO p p 0 0 and PLL are important but

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.490 
CFO p p 0 0 and PLL are important but
for<00:04:04.600> some<00:04:04.780> 20<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.380> not<00:04:06.300> fundamental<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:08.290> look

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
for some 20 it's not fundamental to look

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.460 
for some 20 it's not fundamental to look
we'll<00:04:08.650> still<00:04:08.890> get<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.160> sub<00:04:09.959> sub<00:04:10.959> 20<00:04:11.230> and

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
we'll still get you sub sub 20 and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.130 
we'll still get you sub sub 20 and
certainly<00:04:12.430> some<00:04:12.610> 30<00:04:12.989> even<00:04:13.989> with<00:04:14.110> a

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
certainly some 30 even with a

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.180 
certainly some 30 even with a
store-bought<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.100> yep<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.859> by<00:04:17.859> now<00:04:18.010> you're

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
store-bought so yep and by now you're

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.849 
store-bought so yep and by now you're
probably<00:04:18.220> wondering<00:04:19.109> what<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.140> have<00:04:20.530> right

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
probably wondering what I have right

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.060 
probably wondering what I have right
here<00:04:20.919> because<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.210> actually<00:04:22.479> looks<00:04:23.050> like<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.229> VQ

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
here because it actually looks like a VQ

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.510 
here because it actually looks like a VQ
three<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:26.600> know<00:04:26.720> same<00:04:27.170> color<00:04:27.320> scheme<00:04:29.290> yep

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
three and you know same color scheme yep

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.590 
three and you know same color scheme yep
the<00:04:31.520> only<00:04:31.700> reason<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:32.060> would<00:04:32.180> know<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:32.419> not

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
the only reason you would know it's not

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.250 
the only reason you would know it's not
as<00:04:32.780> one<00:04:32.990> hasn't<00:04:33.770> been<00:04:33.980> produced<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:35.360> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
as one hasn't been produced and to the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.860 
as one hasn't been produced and to the
orange<00:04:36.560> looks<00:04:36.740> really<00:04:37.190> weird<00:04:37.510> it's<00:04:38.510> hard<00:04:38.720> for

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
orange looks really weird it's hard for

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.629 
orange looks really weird it's hard for
the<00:04:38.930> camera<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.260> pick<00:04:39.500> up<00:04:39.650> but<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.340> isn't

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
the camera to pick up but this isn't
