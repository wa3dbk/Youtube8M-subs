just<00:00:54.860> because<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:56.720> know<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:56.870> think

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
just because the the you know I think

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.750 
just because the the you know I think
it's<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.590> sign<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.040> times<00:00:58.070> more<00:00:58.700> than

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's a sign of the times more than

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.850 
it's a sign of the times more than
anything<00:00:59.090> else<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.600> think<00:00:59.810> we<00:01:00.380> see<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.710> with

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
anything else and I think we see it with

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.230 
anything else and I think we see it with
other<00:01:01.040> events<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:01.520> see<00:01:01.670> with<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.910> super
