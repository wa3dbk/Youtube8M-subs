00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
the lego architecture Robie house this

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:34.910 

it's<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.800> 20<00:00:28.730> 1010<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:33.200> now<00:00:34.200> you're<00:00:34.500> looking

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:50.690 

right<00:00:40.370> built<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:42.680> 1906<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:49.700> that's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
right built in 1906 and so now that's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
right built in 1906 and so now that's
part<00:00:51.059> nuts<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> very<00:00:51.840> front<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> the

part nuts in the very front of the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.979 
part nuts in the very front of the
instruction<00:00:53.010> book<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.960> shows

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
instruction book so on the back it shows

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
instruction book so on the back it shows
and<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.770> stuff<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.699> you

can take your stuff off is a huge set 41
steps<00:01:17.210> like<00:01:18.210> I've<00:01:18.390> said<00:01:18.570> earlier<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:19.140> two

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
steps like I've said earlier of two

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.820 
steps like I've said earlier of two
thousand<00:01:19.740> something<00:01:19.920> some<00:01:20.369> pieces<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.290> on

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
thousand something some pieces so now on

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.440 
thousand something some pieces so now on
to<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.900> actual<00:01:28.490> set<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> front<00:01:32.450> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to the actual set so on the front so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
to the actual set so on the front so
there's<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.290> over<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
there's a lot to go over on here so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
there's a lot to go over on here so
let's<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:35.939> start<00:01:36.329> at<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.509> front<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.110> here

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
let's just start at the front right here

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
let's just start at the front right here

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and right here there's the sign that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.359 
and right here there's the sign that
says<00:01:44.909> Robie<00:01:45.270> house<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:46.560> walkway<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
says Robie house a little walkway and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
says Robie house a little walkway and
you<00:01:47.430> go<00:01:47.579> through<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.140> back<00:01:49.350> here

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
see

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
see
that's<00:02:08.789> probably<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.289> there's<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
that's probably and here there's a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.780 
that's probably and here there's a
little<00:02:10.709> front<00:02:11.069> yard<00:02:11.310> area<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:13.370> around<00:02:14.370> here

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
little front yard area and around here

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.320 
little front yard area and around here
you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:17.069> balcony<00:02:17.370> and

you can go up here to this balcony and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.930 
you can go up here to this balcony and
there's<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.989> little<00:02:19.650> door<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.370> there<00:02:22.819> then<00:02:23.819> you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
there's a little door in there then you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.610 
there's a little door in there then you
can<00:02:24.150> come<00:02:24.420> back<00:02:24.450> here

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
can come back here

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:40.370 
can come back here
I<00:02:25.650> bet<00:02:26.489> they're<00:02:26.730> supposed<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> bore<00:02:39.380> if

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
I bet they're supposed to be a bore if

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.610 
I bet they're supposed to be a bore if
you<00:02:40.560> look<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.010> there's<00:02:41.640> another<00:02:41.940> door

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
you look in here there's another door

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.280 
you look in here there's another door
probably<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.920> front<00:02:44.220> door<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.630> also

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
probably like the front door and also

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.339 
probably like the front door and also
they're<00:02:46.799> like<00:02:47.040> these<00:02:47.310> three<00:02:47.959> flower<00:02:48.959> pots

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
they're like these three flower pots

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.180 
they're like these three flower pots
there's<00:02:49.920> one<00:02:50.360> there's<00:02:51.360> two<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> front

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
there's one there's two in the front

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.309 
there's one there's two in the front
which<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:53.489> back<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.890> now<00:02:56.989> something<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.140> can

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
which one back so now something you can

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.949 
which one back so now something you can
do<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.360> take<00:03:00.599> off<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
do with this you can like take off the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.160 
do with this you can like take off the
roofs<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.650> stuff<00:03:01.980> stuff<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.690> up<00:03:03.900> here

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
roofs and stuff stuff and up here

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.380 
roofs and stuff stuff and up here
there's<00:03:04.319> like<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> third<00:03:04.860> bubble<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.180> if<00:03:06.269> you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
there's like a third bubble so if you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.370 
there's like a third bubble so if you
take<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.349> off<00:03:08.690> here<00:03:09.690> there's<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.200> where

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
take this off here there's like where

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:21.490 
take this off here there's like where
the<00:03:10.470> garage<00:03:10.799> would<00:03:11.160> be<00:03:19.670> check<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.819> up<00:03:21.030> online

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
the garage would be check this up online

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.280 
the garage would be check this up online
this<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:23.190> think<00:03:23.639> it's<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> garage<00:03:24.329> this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
this is I think it's like a garage this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.140 
this is I think it's like a garage this
is<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> living<00:03:26.100> room<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:28.139> then<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:29.150> thing

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
is like a living room and then a thing

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.479 
is like a living room and then a thing
