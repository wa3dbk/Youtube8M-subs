00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.690 
back the materials made it a place it
looked<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.900> was<00:03:23.140> designed<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.800> 1960<00:03:24.520> with

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
looked like it was designed in 1960 with

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.130 
looked like it was designed in 1960 with
a<00:03:24.730> furniture<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.450> was<00:03:25.690> there<00:03:25.959> at<00:03:26.110> that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
a furniture that was there at that

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.690 
a furniture that was there at that
moment<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.870> seems<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.260> me<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:30.010> values<00:03:30.400> of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
moment it seems to me that the values of

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.660 
moment it seems to me that the values of
that<00:03:30.880> moment<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.540> 1960<00:03:32.290> are<00:03:32.500> here<00:03:32.800> again<00:03:33.100> that
