please<00:00:18.960> don't<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.830> e-reader

please don't do this with your e-reader

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.349 
please don't do this with your e-reader
at<00:00:20.400> home<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:21.199> another<00:00:22.199> example<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:24.090> paper

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
at home as another example of the paper

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
at home as another example of the paper
being<00:00:24.720> used<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.289> different<00:00:25.410> applications<00:00:25.699> is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
being used for different applications is

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.029 
being used for different applications is
something<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.359> outdoor<00:00:27.750> signs<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:28.949> we

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
something for outdoor signs so here we

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.160 
something for outdoor signs so here we
have<00:00:29.070> an<00:00:29.279> example<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.939> where<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.869> create<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
have an example of where we can create a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
have an example of where we can create a
very<00:00:31.410> large<00:00:31.710> sign<00:00:32.099> using<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.910> number<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
very large sign using a number of

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.229 
very large sign using a number of
smaller<00:00:33.660> displays<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.340> big<00:00:35.640> advantage<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
smaller displays so a big advantage of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.819 
smaller displays so a big advantage of
this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> uses<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.440> power

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this is that it uses very little power

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.100 
this is that it uses very little power
and<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.670> could<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> sign<00:00:39.270> outdoors<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and you could have a sign outdoors and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
and you could have a sign outdoors and
they<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.469> basically<00:00:41.190> using<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.059> no

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
they like basically using little to no

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600 
they like basically using little to no
power<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> here's<00:00:43.920> something<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.430> really

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
power and here's something that's really

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
power and here's something that's really
different<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.140> signage<00:00:46.649> display

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
different we have a signage display

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
different we have a signage display
that's<00:00:47.399> made<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> large<00:00:48.420> number<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that's made up of a large number of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.130 
that's made up of a large number of
small<00:00:49.020> ink<00:00:49.829> displays<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> used<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
small ink displays that can be used to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.220 
small ink displays that can be used to
display<00:00:53.010> information<00:00:53.340> during<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> day<00:00:54.480> with

novel idea they've taken a ink paper

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.830 
novel idea they've taken a ink paper
that<00:02:03.310> actually<00:02:03.640> has<00:02:03.820> no<00:02:04.149> power<00:02:04.450> there's<00:02:04.720> no

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
that actually has no power there's no

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.600 
that actually has no power there's no
bad<00:02:05.079> reason<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.920> actually<00:02:06.220> like<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> piece

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
bad reason this is actually like a piece

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.969 
bad reason this is actually like a piece
of<00:02:06.640> paper<00:02:06.939> but<00:02:07.659> what's<00:02:07.810> great<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.410> you

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
of paper but what's great is that you

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.610 
of paper but what's great is that you
can<00:02:09.099> put<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.399> next<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.789> device<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.569> that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
can put it next to a device and that

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.040 
can put it next to a device and that
device<00:02:11.620> provides<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.310> power<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.540> change

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
device provides the power to to change

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.280 
device provides the power to to change
the<00:02:14.319> display<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.459> if<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.730> actually<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.299> some

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
the display so if you actually have some

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.309 
the display so if you actually have some
sort<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:18.030> industrial<00:02:19.030> system<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.720> other<00:02:20.019> type

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
sort of industrial system or other type

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.110 
sort of industrial system or other type
of<00:02:20.350> information<00:02:20.709> system<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.819> can<00:02:21.970> take

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
of information system you can take

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.140 
of information system you can take
advantage<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:24.130> setup<00:02:24.489> because<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.000> uses

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
advantage of the setup because it uses

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.240 
advantage of the setup because it uses
such<00:02:25.390> low<00:02:25.630> power<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.560> power<00:02:26.799> display

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
such low power you can power display

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.380 
such low power you can power display
directly<00:02:27.940> off<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.840> RFID<00:02:29.319> signal<00:02:30.390> coming

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
directly off of the RFID signal coming

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.000 
directly off of the RFID signal coming
from<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.690> device<00:02:31.930> another<00:02:32.799> great

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
from the device another great

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.330 
from the device another great
application<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.060> Yankee<00:02:34.810> paper<00:02:35.280> thank<00:02:36.280> you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
application of Yankee paper thank you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.120 
application of Yankee paper thank you
very<00:02:36.370> much<00:02:36.549> thank<00:02:37.000> you
