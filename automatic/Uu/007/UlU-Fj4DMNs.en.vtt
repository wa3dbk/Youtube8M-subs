this is called the large 12th pan

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.320 
this is called the large 12th pan
because<00:02:02.440> they<00:02:02.740> have<00:02:02.920> another<00:02:03.400> palette<00:02:04.030> that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
because they have another palette that

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.050 
because they have another palette that
that's<00:02:04.780> 12<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.530> also<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:09.280> pans<00:02:09.700> are

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
that's 12 and also but the the pans are

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.030 
that's 12 and also but the the pans are
small<00:02:10.509> so<00:02:11.409> they<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:12.959> 12<00:02:13.959> pan<00:02:14.349> small<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
small so they have a 12 pan small and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.280 
small so they have a 12 pan small and

yet so that's all I did they're the

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.999 
yet so that's all I did they're the
perfect<00:05:10.519> size<00:05:10.789> there<00:05:11.329> was<00:05:11.419> no<00:05:11.629> room<00:05:12.050> for<00:05:12.559> you

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
perfect size there was no room for you

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.399 
perfect size there was no room for you
can't<00:05:13.249> move<00:05:13.459> them<00:05:13.669> around<00:05:13.789> or<00:05:14.149> anything<00:05:14.409> so

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
can't move them around or anything so

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
just took that off I kind of cut it out

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.209 
just took that off I kind of cut it out
and<00:05:33.039> we<00:05:34.089> stuck<00:05:35.089> it<00:05:35.119> to<00:05:35.769> the<00:05:36.769> top<00:05:36.979> of<00:05:37.039> the

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:42.019 
palette I'm not very creative so I

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:44.709

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
bit like I can bend this and it will be

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.400 
bit like I can bend this and it will be
forever<00:07:00.060> bent<00:07:00.540> because<00:07:00.780> it's<00:07:01.050> made<00:07:01.230> out<00:07:01.380> of

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
forever bent because it's made out of

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.090 
forever bent because it's made out of
some<00:07:01.680> kind<00:07:01.830> of<00:07:01.950> like<00:07:03.650> cardboard<00:07:04.650> or<00:07:05.040> something

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
some kind of like cardboard or something

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.120 
some kind of like cardboard or something
and<00:07:06.000> so<00:07:06.540> it<00:07:06.780> has<00:07:06.960> ugly<00:07:07.200> scratches<00:07:07.950> and

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
and so it has ugly scratches and

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.570 
and so it has ugly scratches and
everything<00:07:08.580> on<00:07:08.820> it<00:07:09.120> because<00:07:09.920> you<00:07:10.920> put<00:07:11.130> a<00:07:11.160> dent

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
everything on it because you put a dent

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.770 
everything on it because you put a dent
in<00:07:11.790> it<00:07:11.910> and<00:07:12.180> it's<00:07:12.450> going<00:07:12.630> to<00:07:12.720> stay<00:07:13.100> simony<00:07:14.100> make

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
in it and it's going to stay simony make

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.970 
in it and it's going to stay simony make
because<00:07:15.780> that's<00:07:16.230> what<00:07:16.440> it's<00:07:16.590> made<00:07:16.650> out<00:07:16.800> of

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
because that's what it's made out of

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.580 
because that's what it's made out of
that's<00:07:17.400> the<00:07:17.490> only<00:07:17.670> thing<00:07:17.790> I<00:07:17.910> don't<00:07:17.970> like<00:07:18.590> I

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
that's the only thing I don't like I

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.380 
that's the only thing I don't like I
think<00:07:20.550> that's<00:07:20.730> about<00:07:20.880> all<00:07:21.000> the<00:07:21.240> questions

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390 
think that's about all the questions

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.620 
think that's about all the questions
that<00:07:21.870> I<00:07:22.050> had<00:07:22.320> on<00:07:22.350> this<00:07:22.740> palette<00:07:23.450> like<00:07:24.450> I<00:07:24.570> said
