00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.569
 just a better one because I took 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.550
 the time still invested children 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.990

 sometimes peas is super strong non wage 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.600
 because like rain it looks like 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.189
 ly as the fact that plastic 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.810

 vegetables under it's really not 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 perfect appearance is because 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.829
 I really play calm and at 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.450
 microwave well heat up because of the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.180
 really healthy meal soap I have a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.579
 super rich or the and vegetables with a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 glass of water and beat chips that comes as 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.780
 ruin the semblance of healthy rest 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.099
 that I try to see with my soup 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.540
 look what I found in 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.489
 my brother 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.799
 cinnamon bun is clear that I 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.299
 the strength right away as 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.890
 worried parent me buns are in the process 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.359
 to cook 7 doing a little 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.489
 mounting them me more big thing to 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.959
 to do is a ghetto and 8 me for the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.909
 back to school obviously because 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.859
 it's really the series I'm doing 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.989
 right now that I have left my 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.459
 intro then a cut of little things to 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.780
 train according to I have a lot of finishing 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.209
 did I still like that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.069
 patiently online section tomorrow morning 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.389
 this possible maybe Friday the but 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.129
 tomorrow morning it's fine because 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.810
 I have mcdo games planned Sunday that 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.280
 I do not want to be too late 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.750
 in my schedule I wanted to be 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 human today I'm going to show you 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.980
 what tent really requires tip bag 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.939
 with stuff that's like two or 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.500
 three modes I buy 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.549
 I wait all the time like you 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.959
 present them because I wanted 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.430
 wait for a big bone but the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.139
 suspense that is going to be really big 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.489
 but surely would not be an opportunity 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.959
 of a movie today is actually because 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.849
 that I think I'm all alone 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.859
 at home but no my brother has arrived 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.269
 with his friend is that it is not 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.159
 really an opportunity but to film a 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.319
 video is what I speak since years and 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.519
 I began to meet 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.500
 questions I think they pay more 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.870
 for on my channel it's a family 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.090
 do you say alone it's in 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.049
 the affirmative to the first question yes 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.669
 I have a family 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.650
 no I live all alone in head screw with 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.419
 my parents and my brother but the reason 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.340
 to welcome me I never saw them 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.750
 in video is that I think I 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.180
 share anyway during the trick of my 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.579
 life which is certainly something that I like 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.019
 maybe a little more keep private sax 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.879
 it's a part of my life that I think 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.040
 not that they really stick super 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.109
 important to souls have agreed that I 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.489
 think it takes nothing to do 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.930
 what I do on my chair for the 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.699
 moment I think for you to go 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.010
 really family maybe someday but 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.900
 not in the near future if you 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.790
 also ask little will speak to the stones 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.440
 go along the port do it either because 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.659
 that still the trophy breast 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.919
 personal the pick up I think that's 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.500
 is really necessary to your 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.699
 understanding of my life that is I think 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.349
 that I still share a lot 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.540
 like that fact that I would like to keep myself 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.159
 this aspect the hand is not very 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.010
 high but here you have the answer 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.630
 you know why do you ever see me 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.790
 my family 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.160
 unlock watch it start with hbo 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.870
 for the last one while I was doing 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.280
 had someone poloids crimes 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.450
 Geslin concept always takes precedence over the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.100
 photo paper because I find that 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.840
 it is really more beautiful but as I 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.280
 ai promised on his side the first time 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.870
 in the printer access like a fruit 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.990
 are the bad sides but look at that 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.430
 like last year at andrÃ©e kaka risk 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.930
 as only I guess I'm from 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.280
 to wipe it sometimes but look at my hands 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.080
 I was cutting and then I 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.580
 wondering as what was happening 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.110
 but no it's just me who was 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.180
 nourished who represses the waters of the other 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.920
 side because it more or less 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.830
 worked as you can see the game 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.510
 let it dry a bit I hope it 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.070
 dry and given moment but you are serious 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.090
 than what if ever like that it sounds 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.590
 Too beautiful but it's really like 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.760
 because I do not want to hide them 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.100
 hands then I do not want to stain like 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.900
 all my other stuff too but at the 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.330
 the and that often that's what happens 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.970
 when I dedicate you to rent that plant whose 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.260
 the accident I finished my video and diallo 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.330
 and two lockers tomorrow he just wants 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.370
 marester refined in the locker as 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.840
 that which is it took me more than 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.820
 time than I thought the reality 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.230
 I thought I would finish like in the beginning after 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.640
 noon but the eye and a little bit more 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.680
 than 16 years old but I think that's the 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.760
 to have breaking bad back 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.500
 plan that I am able 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.940
 to stop watching him as I move forward 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.800
 little but good I still finished this 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.990
 fact that it is already only satisfied 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.480
 that of an exile nor me any disturbed alloys 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.850
 who mixes up my room or if I 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.470
 want a full divorce the extent of the 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.970
 disaster but I think it would be 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.370
 really time that my name is this 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.780
 poor and the acts of which that was what 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.610
 I was talking to you when I told you 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.150
 best brothel in my room and who 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.940
 try if there are plenty of them shared here 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.500
 in europe there is here the back gentlemen 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.980
 how so much cleaner than 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.470
 sometimes I have a floor we see the 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.230
 floor I vacuumed here 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.270
 it's almost clean and the 100 train 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.120
 to put the stuff in my bag because 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.040
 that as I say tomorrow I value the 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.990
 Senegal is mixing everything up 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.670
 through all the trucks back 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.190
 it's the stuff I 'm going to film 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.110
 tomorrow it brings us seismic pic of 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.700
 worry I'm really proud of myself that's 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.900
 been productive as a day and then I 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.409
 changed from shanghai because I had 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.089
 really 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.860
 the yari of the most beautiful they sun is 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.580
 come out then it's just like it does 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.259
 really hot 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.059
 I took a break from all things 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.219
 important things I had to do for myself 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:21.339
 I have my own security continues my 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.719
 episode of breaking bad it's an axis 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.580
 but I think I'll stop the 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.439
 blog because I really should
