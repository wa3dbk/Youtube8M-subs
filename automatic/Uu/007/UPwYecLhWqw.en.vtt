00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.599
 what 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.639
 or the attraction in that kitchen easy my 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.780
 name is andy and today I am going to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.230
 teach how to make a delicious recipe 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 Mexican is a delicious green barbecue 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 it usually goes more just cooking this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 on special occasions but it's so 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.890
 easy to make and so delicious 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.750
 surely you will want it 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.250
 do every day the time of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.900
 preparation and cooking time 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.730
 combined about one hour 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.330
 I hope you like this recipe 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.330
 let us begin 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.630
 we are going to peel the tomatitos and we are going 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.630
 to place in a pot 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 we're going to take the chili's tail off 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.700
 poblanos and we will also take away the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.350
 tail to the jalapeÃ±o peppers and let's go 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.710
 to place in the same pot with the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.710
 tomatitos 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.490
 let's rinse this with a little bit of 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.890
 Water 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.540
 and then we are going to add to the pot the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.520
 enough water to cover all the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.230
 ingredients and now we are going to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 cook on high for 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.280
 approximately 10 or 15 minutes or 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.200
 until everything is soft 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 while the chiles and the yellows 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.909
 they cook now in a large saucepan 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.460
 let's cook the meat myself 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.080
 I'm using pork loin without 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.270
 bone if you like they can also 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.280
 add sliced â€‹â€‹pork ribs 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.990
 in small pieces to give them a 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.600
 little bit more of flavor and consistency 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.790
 roast 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009
 and let's cook the meat on high heat 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.350
 for about 10 or 15 minutes 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 so that it starts to cook I'm going to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 season with a little salt and pepper 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.770
 and then I'm going to stir a little and I'm going 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.450
 cover the pan with a cover for 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 that the meat cook faster 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.340
 while the meat is cooking now let's go 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.790
 to go back to the peppers and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.380
 tomatitos 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.850
 how can you see the chilies and 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.330
 tomatitos already changed a little 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.860
 colour 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.540
 that means that they are already soft 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.020
 so I'm going to place them in the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.020
 blender 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.710
 in the blender we are also going to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.630
 add the avocado the garlic and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.730
 about a quarter cup of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.760
 fresh cilantro we are also going to 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.800
 add a cup of water season with salt 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.900
 to taste and ground black pepper 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.240
 taste and now let's liquefy this to 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.490
 high speed by approximately 3 or 5 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 minutes or until everything is fine 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.960
 incorporated in a mild sauce since the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.420
 salsa is ready now we are going to 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.490
 book for a moment let's review 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.800
 the meat as you can see the meat already 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.140
 took a little bit of color and lost that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.150
 red or pink color that is 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.830
 characteristic of raw meat and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.170
 It has a little more color but 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.790
 It is still not fully cooked well 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.510
 that now we are going to add the sauce 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.790
 green 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 after adding the green sauce I'm going to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.810
 add one more cup of water to the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.239
 blender and this water I'm going to empty 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.060
 over the green sauce I'm going to stir very 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.010
 well and then taste the flavor add 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.799
 more salt or pepper if you think it necessary 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.379
 revol go a little cover this with the 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.030
 cover and cook over medium heat until 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.390
 that boils this takes about 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.579
 about 3 or 5 minutes since the sauce is 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.250
 boiling now let's lower the fire to 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.590
 the lowest and we will continue cooking 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.540
 the meat for about 15 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.569
 more minutes for the meat to finish 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.370
 of cooking and that's it already after 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.230
 about 15 minutes the meat should be 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.549
 fully cooked so they can 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.950
 try a bit to see if you are already 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.049
 squishy and that's all since the meat 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.389
 it is very soft the roast is ready 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.430
 so you can serve it I will serve me 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.840
 roasted with a little bit of white rice and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.940
 I'm going to decorate with a little more 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.830
 coriander 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.900
 This dish goes rich also with 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.130
 white spaghetti so if you do not like it 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.650
 much rice can serve it with 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.420
 white spaghetti and they will stay 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.420
 spectacular and that's all good profit 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.810
