here<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:03.449> who's<00:00:04.080> frustrated<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.980> our<00:00:05.009> new

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
here on who's frustrated with our new

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.419 
here on who's frustrated with our new
challenges<00:00:06.060> with<00:00:06.299> Google<00:00:06.690> Calendar<00:00:06.950> so<00:00:07.950> in

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
challenges with Google Calendar so in

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.970 
challenges with Google Calendar so in
Windows<00:00:09.000> 8<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> Windows<00:00:09.960> 8<00:00:10.080> calendar<00:00:10.410> no

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
Windows 8 so the Windows 8 calendar no

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.740 
Windows 8 so the Windows 8 calendar no
longer<00:00:11.519> supports<00:00:12.150> Google<00:00:13.110> Calendar<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.750> you

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
longer supports Google Calendar so you

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
longer supports Google Calendar so you
cannot<00:00:16.109> synchronize<00:00:16.859> any<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> work<00:00:17.789> that

ahead and take a look here at a few

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200 
ahead and take a look here at a few
settings<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.160> go<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> settings<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
accounts we can see here that when we

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
accounts we can see here that when we
add<00:00:30.750> an<00:00:30.990> account<00:00:31.289> although<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:32.279> display<00:00:32.880> may

it is that when you get done you're not

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.069 
it is that when you get done you're not
going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.030> able<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.420> synchronize<00:00:43.050> your

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
calendar and even if it says content to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
calendar and even if it says content to
