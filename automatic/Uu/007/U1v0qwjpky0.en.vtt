and<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> could<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> pure<00:01:42.930> gas<00:01:43.439> dryer<00:01:43.710> right

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and it could be a pure gas dryer right

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
and it could be a pure gas dryer right
words<00:01:44.310> yeah<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.270> deployed

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
words yeah you can have a just deployed

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.469 
words yeah you can have a just deployed
things<00:01:45.990> into<00:01:46.229> orbit<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:47.220> mine<00:01:47.610> he3<00:01:48.060> or

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
things into orbit to mine he3 or

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.880 
things into orbit to mine he3 or
something<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> exactly<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.649> big

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
something like that exactly like big

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.190 
something like that exactly like big
orbital<00:01:50.310> gas<00:01:50.460> lines<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.020> use

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
orbital gas lines that that you can use

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
orbital gas lines that that you can use
to<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.560> pump<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:52.979> energy<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.670> let's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
to really pump up your energy so let's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
to really pump up your energy so let's
say<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> wanted<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> map

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
say you know you wanted to have a map

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.870 
say you know you wanted to have a map
where<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> wanted<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.399> ridiculous

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
where you wanted to have ridiculous

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
where you wanted to have ridiculous
meant<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> energy<00:01:57.479> throw<00:01:57.659> some<00:01:57.840> gas<00:01:57.990> giants<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
meant to energy throw some gas giants in

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
meant to energy throw some gas giants in
there<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> people<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.490> decide<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.759> they<00:01:59.939> want

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
there and people can decide if they want

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.609 
there and people can decide if they want
to<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.270> over<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.719> after<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.110> stuff<00:02:01.350> early

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to go over go after that stuff early

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.450 
to go over go after that stuff early
game<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:02.009> later

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
game or later

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.820 
game or later
game<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:03.120> whatever<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:04.380> kind<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
game or whatever it's kind of like a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
game or whatever it's kind of like a
metal<00:02:05.460> map<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> answer<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.300> those

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
metal map you know the answer to those

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.669 
metal map you know the answer to those
questions<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.080> all<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> answers<00:02:10.350> for<00:02:10.619> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
questions I got all the answers for that

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
questions I got all the answers for that
okay<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.130> probably<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.850> number<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.180> question

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
okay so probably the number one question

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.930 
okay so probably the number one question
that<00:02:13.050> I've<00:02:13.410> seen<00:02:13.650> raised<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:14.850> going

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
that I've seen raised is is there going

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.390 
that I've seen raised is is there going
to<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.090> skirmish<00:02:15.810> against<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.140> AI<00:02:16.400> standalone

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
to be skirmish against the AI standalone

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.460 
to be skirmish against the AI standalone
skirmish<00:02:17.850> against<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> AI<00:02:18.330> yeah<00:02:19.200> there's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
skirmish against the AI yeah there's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.630 
skirmish against the AI yeah there's
going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.709> skirmish<00:02:20.100> mode<00:02:20.190> there's<00:02:20.489> going

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
going to be skirmish mode there's going

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.830 
going to be skirmish mode there's going
to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.730> multiple<00:02:21.120> different<00:02:21.239> types<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.630> AI

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to be multiple different types of AI

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.479 
to be multiple different types of AI
multiple<00:02:22.350> levels<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.680> aia<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.310> play

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
multiple levels of aia you can play

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.150 
multiple levels of aia you can play
against<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> bunch<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.720> want

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.260 
against a bunch of a is if you want
skirmish<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.340> definitely<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> first<00:02:27.030> class

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
skirmish is definitely a first class

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.330 
skirmish is definitely a first class
citizen<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.080> game<00:02:28.470> no<00:02:28.770> question<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
citizen of the game no question about it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.040 
citizen of the game no question about it
what<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.060> showed<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> trailer<00:02:30.840> was

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
what we showed in the trailer was

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.320 
what we showed in the trailer was
basically<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.530> single<00:02:31.830> planet<00:02:32.330> asteroid

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
basically a single planet asteroid

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.350 
basically a single planet asteroid
little<00:02:33.720> asteroid<00:02:34.080> belt<00:02:35.300> people<00:02:36.300> are

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
little asteroid belt people are

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.850 
little asteroid belt people are
wondering<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.989> know<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.680> actual

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
wondering you know is that the actual

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.199 
wondering you know is that the actual
size<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.459> planners<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:38.940> how<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.120> you

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
size of the planners now how do you

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.330 
size of the planners now how do you
think<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.590> final<00:02:40.890> game<00:02:41.070> will<00:02:41.220> be

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
think that the final game will be

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.190 
think that the final game will be
different<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.820> terms<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.120> scale<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.600> scope<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
different in terms of scale and scope I

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.070 
different in terms of scale and scope I
have<00:02:43.530> no<00:02:43.709> idea<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:45.750> know<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.959> video

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
have no idea you know the video

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.870 
have no idea you know the video
shouldn't<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.620> taken<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.040> gospel<00:02:47.070> as<00:02:47.610> far<00:02:47.790> as

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
shouldn't be taken as gospel as far as

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.850 
shouldn't be taken as gospel as far as
scope<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.209> scale<00:02:48.330> goes<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.350> just<00:02:49.650> one

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
scope and scale goes it's just one

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.410 
scope and scale goes it's just one
possible<00:02:50.400> scenario<00:02:50.580> right<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> mean<00:02:51.300> we<00:02:51.390> had

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
possible scenario right I mean we had

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.449 
possible scenario right I mean we had
basically<00:02:51.870> an<00:02:52.050> earth-type<00:02:52.290> planet<00:02:52.860> moon<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
basically an earth-type planet moon and

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.150 
basically an earth-type planet moon and
an<00:02:53.519> asteroid<00:02:53.760> belt<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.930> level<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:55.860> i

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
an asteroid belt that's a level but i

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.670 
an asteroid belt that's a level but i
can<00:02:56.489> see<00:02:56.700> scenarios<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:58.170> i've<00:02:58.290> talked<00:02:58.470> about

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
can see scenarios like i've talked about

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.770 
can see scenarios like i've talked about
before<00:02:58.830> where<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.790> for<00:03:00.450> eight

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
before where we have you know for eight

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.420 
before where we have you know for eight
planets<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.680> bunch<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.980> players<00:03:02.160> on<00:03:02.400> each

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
planets and a bunch of players on each

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.250 
planets and a bunch of players on each
one<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.060> kind<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.300> come<00:03:03.480> together<00:03:03.660> at<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> end

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
one it kind of come together at the end

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.370 
one it kind of come together at the end
of<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> battle<00:03:04.850> how<00:03:05.850> macro<00:03:06.330> versus<00:03:06.690> micro<00:03:07.140> is

emphasis<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.769> micro<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.190> actually<00:03:11.579> win<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
emphasis on micro to actually win the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.729 
emphasis on micro to actually win the
game<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.360> think<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.720> emphasis<00:03:13.049> here<00:03:13.079> is<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.560> be

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
game I think the emphasis here is on be

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.199 
game I think the emphasis here is on be
able<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.980> execute<00:03:14.310> your<00:03:14.549> high-level<00:03:14.730> plan

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
able to execute your high-level plan

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940 
able to execute your high-level plan
however<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.049> have<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.200> think<00:03:16.410> about<00:03:16.560> this

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
however you have to think about this

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.350 
however you have to think about this
kind<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.280> game<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.760> have<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.880> commander

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
kind of game if you have a commander

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.090 
kind of game if you have a commander
that's<00:03:18.720> inherently<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.260> hero<00:03:19.530> unit<00:03:19.890> that's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
that's inherently a hero unit that's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.470 
that's inherently a hero unit that's
inherently<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> involve<00:03:20.910> some<00:03:21.030> micro

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
inherently going to involve some micro

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.840 
inherently going to involve some micro
especially<00:03:21.959> early<00:03:21.989> game<00:03:22.470> but<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.670> most

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
especially early game but for the most

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.240 
especially early game but for the most
part<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:25.290> know<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.650> emphasis<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.040> on

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
part you know the emphasis is on

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.009 
part you know the emphasis is on
high-level<00:03:26.579> strategic<00:03:26.940> vision<00:03:27.840> and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
high-level strategic vision and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.130 
high-level strategic vision and
implementing<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:29.329> so<00:03:30.329> does<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.780> commander

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
implementing that so does the commander

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.750 
implementing that so does the commander
still<00:03:31.590> go<00:03:31.680> nuclear<00:03:31.950> when<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.310> gets<00:03:32.459> destroyed

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
still go nuclear when it gets destroyed

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.990 
still go nuclear when it gets destroyed
of<00:03:32.970> course<00:03:33.860> something<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.190> if<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.880> go

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
of course something is that if you go

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.100 
of course something is that if you go
out<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.180> got<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.450> go<00:03:36.540> out<00:03:36.570> with<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.870> bang

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.170
