00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 where we know now moderate low to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 moderate this afternoon on the camaro hello to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.560
 all at once at the same time 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.450
 with some light sails a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.460
 outside temperature at 24.1 degrees a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.040
 water temperature at 19 degrees from 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 tide that is going down the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.700
 plane b is at 14:50 the coefficients of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 85 on his descendants getting up and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.899
 offshore but he hesitates times he is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 northeast is a strong word small burst to 2 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.440
 sometimes they passed south is a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 jester who crosses the demand if 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.840
 offshore the body of water is slightly 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.879
 rider but it's clean and we have one or 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 two languages facing west south west 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 with a second period a man who has 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.949
 a little bigger compared to this morning 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.590
 to a surge now regular 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.860
 at the height of 1 m 1 put in stops 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.150
 on the series 1 m 20 to 1 m 30 with the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.830
 tide coming down activate the winds 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.840
 from offshore there is warrant water everywhere 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 was crammed with world 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.390
 the bar is easy to cross 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 waves are a bit selective on some 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.930
 spots where it's more hollow but the swell 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.430
 is not very very well oriented she is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 very very long there is not a lot of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.880
 spotify works that shifts that closes his 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.920
 pass is very random 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 there are some rare spots where the waves 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 are fairly regular evolution for 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.750
 the rest of the day but change 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.159
 for the forecast it will stay 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.900
 stationary until evening why 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.970
 because there is still some size 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.579
 on the drink hiding at two meters 10 and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.290
 8 seconds last raised so at 13h in 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.970
 be 30 or west ham south west from where 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.490
 second period the wind rather north-east 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770
 has strong words and at 17h still a being 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 30 or west and southwest in second 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 period with a wind that must pass 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.899
 north to beaufort bah it should be 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.490
 degrade a bit this afternoon but the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 breeze did not see too much with the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.939
 rising tide and the big coeff so to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.450
 surf and action anyway 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.200
 the day 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.690
 then action on 08 92 29 78 73 to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.620
