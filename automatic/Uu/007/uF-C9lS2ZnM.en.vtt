 tankers with you again max fur and already 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.580
 eighth gear release and worst replays 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.070
 weeks before the window beautiful weather 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.820
 flowers appear and the first short 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.980
 little skirts 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.650
 but we are tirelessly continuing to select for 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 you have the most fun and the replay time our 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.149
 today's release is dedicated 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.670
 beloved by all artillery then 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.960
 let's go up and go 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.960
 gaze to the battlefield first replay about 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 respect sent us all the world of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.030
 tanks is a tough male game 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.399
 sometimes emotions and brute however there is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 people who are on the battlefield do not forget about 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.149
 cultural behavior here for example t-44 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.340
 fired with tiger 1 and m29 after 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.550
 A couple of minutes of swing; 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.040
 they are healthier their big and start 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.159
 lean on the t-44 trying if not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.950
 shoot the mascara ram up the insolent that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.610
 our hero is not indignant he politely 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.180
 skip first single enemy and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.180
 then another 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.880
 and the fact that behind him was a shallow pond in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.790
 and which drowned the two heavyweights is 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.130
 pure coincidence so comrades 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.240
 tankmen be polite on the battlefield and 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.680
 respect each other well, and replay benefits 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.260
 diets sent us sanya 007 499 silent 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.650
 evening on the far corner of the map 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.540
 favorite habitat of artillery 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.910
 su-14 two after long aiming 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.250
 take out the waffentreguer and starts 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.610
 look at the new goal but here on 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.620
 all couples go amx-13 90 with a clear 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.200
 intent to get even for waffle 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.170
 or is he just hungry and confused 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.570
 Su-14 2 with a fridge in general attempts 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.910
 find where this refrigerator door has 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.740
 and they crawl them too deep and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.880
 drowning empty of time 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.760
 but the pan cares about your health and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.760
 reminds you not to eat after six 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.790
 well and replay misunderstanding lbz 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.280
 self-critically sent us seryoga 64 rub 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.340
 So the first half of the fight player I m 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.410
 4043 has not yet shot any frags and 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.440
 here in his field of sight gets 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.840
 waffentrager pz 4 but not only he 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.300
 one three allies also notices 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.110
 someone 4 and therefore rush to deal with 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.030
 him tight 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.980
 instead of shooting from afar a 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.980
 the projectile is already running 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.730
 here is the area of â€‹â€‹defeat 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.310
 allied players are not just amazed and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.800
 sure emotions just overwhelm them 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.300
 especially considering that the waffenturger is not 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.340
 survived to a volley of artillery but according to the law 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.820
 world of tanks our hero is sent to 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.840
 bathhouse 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.300
 could the spirit of fratricide they play 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 and tactical superiority sent us 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.750
 houses 607 and so the map airfield 4 minutes 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.570
 until the end of the battle enemy art battat 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.530
 stays against two allied sauces and 1 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.530
 bat bat st 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.080
 the triangle begins hunting slowly 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.840
 shrinking but tired of local fats 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.220
 the refrigerator is moving too slowly and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.960
 first catches a gift from art 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.450
 then report or he is 25 years old under the weight 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.780
 guilty of killing an ally commits 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.780
 suicide 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.510
 remaining last t92 decides to arrange 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.190
 ambush base but literally 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.799
 out of nowhere enemy batchat 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.479
 demonstrate something really arranged 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.660
 ambush by the way guys are judging by nick 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:34.000
 piloted and at the top of the art of our girl 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:36.460
 a round of applause a tragic 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.740
 stories in a hidden village sent us 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.320
 hurt wrap perfectly normal 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.630
 situation for the end of the battle fulov I drive 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.310
 one hundred against two battered 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.010
 opponents one of which 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.530
 m46 patton soberly assessing his chances 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.070
 lequip to seize the base maybe 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.650
 grab well eagdpancer e100 is not so 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.900
 and the slow car has time to come and 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.120
 knocked down the base but for some reason climb 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.250
 close in tone to feed 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.560
 itched and naughty American not 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.350
 misses the chance to drop in behind only 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.990
 instead of a friendly scratching starts 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.680
 it seemed mercilessly to shoot the yaga 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.130
 to all 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.130
 and do not dry the paddles the hangar item on 2 of 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.340
 surviving object 704 also decides to snatch 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.520
 a slice of German pie 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.130
 in desperation, the yaga makes a leap forward and 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.320
 ricocheted from the side of the jagdpanther carries 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.320
 down restless payment on 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:49.909
 and barely a living yaga misses the moment and 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:56.000
 sends the object after the world ends 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:06:02.180
 in the hangar yes guys with such allies and 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.090
 no enemies are needed well well guys these were 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.580
 all the replays for today is somehow small 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.889
 Do you really send us such trifles as 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.409
 great weather and girlish smiles 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.050
 distract you from the game we hope above 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.319
 this of our box will soon be overwhelmed 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.849
 dozens of quality replays and 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.759
 recall that detailed information with 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.099
 the time of the event and the essence of what is happening 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.729
 dramatically increase your chances of 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.759
 win 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:33.130
 well, and you had max milky warm plums 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.130
