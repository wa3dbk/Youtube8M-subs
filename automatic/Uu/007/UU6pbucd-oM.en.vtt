shot because it's got the whole zoom
aspect<00:02:21.060> happening<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.640> not

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
aspect happening but it's really not

that the kitchen starts to become more
in<00:02:33.780> focus<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.670> more<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> something<00:02:36.440> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
in focus and more of something that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
in focus and more of something that
becomes<00:02:38.700> more<00:02:38.910> interesting<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.930> look<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
becomes more interesting to look at as a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.910 
becomes more interesting to look at as a
photo<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:41.970> move<00:02:42.210> even<00:02:42.330> closer<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.410> will

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
photo so you move even closer I will

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.170 
photo so you move even closer I will
just<00:02:44.160> try<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:45.240> us<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.260> little<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
just try to see us this so little you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.230 
just try to see us this so little you
can<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.860> how<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.920> photo<00:02:50.340> becomes<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
can see how the photo becomes that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.960 
can see how the photo becomes that
little<00:02:51.990> bit<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.140> interesting<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:55.970> we'll

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
little bit more interesting so we'll

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.680 
little bit more interesting so we'll
pause<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.540> game<00:02:57.570> here<00:02:59.000> and<00:03:00.770> we'll<00:03:01.770> make<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
pause the game here and we'll make the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.120 
pause the game here and we'll make the
fridge<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.290> focus<00:03:04.830> why<00:03:05.490> not<00:03:06.410> let's<00:03:07.410> go<00:03:07.590> boom

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
fridge the focus why not let's go boom

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.460 
fridge the focus why not let's go boom

sim in and get this picture like that it

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.260 
sim in and get this picture like that it
looks<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> good<00:03:29.010> shot<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.000> move

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
looks like a good shot but if you move

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.870 
looks like a good shot but if you move

on<00:03:33.240> how<00:03:33.390> he's<00:03:33.540> focused<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.640> move

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
on how he's focused and then just move

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.840 
on how he's focused and then just move
in<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.150> little<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:38.040> get<00:03:38.220> something<00:03:38.610> that's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
in a little you get something that's

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.550 
in a little you get something that's
just<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.240> little<00:03:39.270> bit<00:03:39.600> more<00:03:39.750> interesting<00:03:40.380> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
just a little bit more interesting to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.370 
just a little bit more interesting to
look<00:03:40.590> at<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.030> there's<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.330> few<00:03:42.510> little<00:03:42.660> tips<00:03:43.020> for

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
I've done to shoot that hopefully

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.230 
I've done to shoot that hopefully
explain<00:03:49.920> what<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.250> mean<00:03:50.310> about<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.910> quotes

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
explain what I mean about to get quotes

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.030

and<00:03:52.020> then<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.410> closer<00:03:52.770> as<00:03:53.240> well<00:03:54.240> as<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.040> if

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
and then get closer as well as the if

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.780 
and then get closer as well as the if
you<00:03:56.220> divide<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.730> screen<00:03:57.030> into<00:03:58.790> three

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
you divide the screen into three

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.360 
you divide the screen into three
sections<00:04:01.730> put<00:04:02.730> your<00:04:03.030> subject<00:04:03.709> into<00:04:04.709> one<00:04:04.980> third

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
sections put your subject into one third

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.930 
sections put your subject into one third
of<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.850> outsides<00:04:06.440> rather<00:04:07.440> than<00:04:07.709> focusing<00:04:08.670> it

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
of the outsides rather than focusing it

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.990 
of the outsides rather than focusing it
on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> inside<00:04:12.709> hopefully<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:13.920> helps<00:04:14.370> make

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
on the inside hopefully this helps make

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.250 
on the inside hopefully this helps make
some<00:04:15.270> photos<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.690> little<00:04:15.870> bit<00:04:16.109> more

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
some photos a little bit more
