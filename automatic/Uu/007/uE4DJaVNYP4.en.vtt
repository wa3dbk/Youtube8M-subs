00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Today we show this weapon all the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 of the epic games shooter game exempel 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.580
 could replace with your own weapon 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.830
 to do that first, the times 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.139
 exporting weapons from apple games so 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.369
 we are now sending in the backend 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 on the tires then right click then 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.800
 export and that was just once 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 as fx because off 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 it needs the program that fbx as 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 innovating as we can transform that way 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 that can then use in blender 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.430
 but I have goals of the max you can 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.230
 but I use another one of data 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.940
 Of course, the op kee fall as 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 download link inside in the description 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 put all4golf import then i take 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:50.640
 the weapon and then I explode you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.020
 just once okay 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.450
 Act a downloadlink confessed 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 sign you imported the weapon 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.360
 So just stay here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.030
 fire in the cockpit and then imported 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.800
 hard drives okay now you have to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.050
 Of course, then your waterholes in 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.509
 In my case this kfw and would have to 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.360
 exactly the position of the epic weapon 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.330
 adapt games and we do that in the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 network so it is in fact each weapon, the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.340
 has to go out a little bit now 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.250
 push back a bit 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.950
 there should also target right there in him 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.550
 be the center of the epic games of 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.869
 So something ok that should fit now 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.160
 we can leave that again 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.590
 the epic games 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.280
 there we can go on now 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 the object then goes to the weapon 3 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.170
 location then object appliance again 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.070
 kay find something boni than on 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.520
 create that is now on production 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.700
 0 sets and then 90 degrees on the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 x-axis rotate the 90 to arms 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.220
 seven and with it the weapon 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.869
 So then you have the floor with the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.600
 weapon bind to the first time on the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.439
 weapon then click on the image control 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.880
 p and then on vista in the tig group now 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.510
 we have connected it up 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.180
 from 3 location object appliance 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.390
 cale ok now we can export 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.060
 arrow export car of the war and then 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
 normally export a afterwards 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.590
 formal shooter game mig 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.590
 armed 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.420
 on a new map that was not so and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.960
 then just mistaken threw imported as 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.120
 right click then import your weapon here 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.650
 just clarify and make sure 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 that he uses in skeletal mesh one 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.170
 otherwise that will not work and then 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.870
 on import okay now we go to the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.120
 blue print queue then on the weapons and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.950
 then go the crest quite crumbling here 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.670
 you already see mesh first stock exchanges around it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.050
 so person 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.290
 I have to get our weapon 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.380
 Add to our weapon clique 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.950
 up and then I would add you 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.810
 now we can do that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.420
 right click on the tried and play for 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.650
 We can not see you now 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.260
 Perfect in our hand we see here 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.600
 but that would have to be in 3d then 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.800
 present program because in the blood print 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.850
 You can unfortunately only the train staff 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.580
 adjust 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.370
 that would just dazzle or with a 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.390
 other program and I adjust 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.100
 I will not do that now because of that 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.670
 is quite time consuming closing it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.540
 now once the family, then I open 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.100
 celebrate my other 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.730
 and I've already got that 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:40.709
 pretended because export then explodes 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.060
 once the then import again so how 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.600
 said there, the position must be simple 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.220
 change 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.260
 that can take a bit of time 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.830
 be a bit annoying after that 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.360
 a good result for me 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.200
 Of course, now is no longer growing 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.720
 you will see 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.530
 but for me it is enough now says leo 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.330
 that's pretty good 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.630
 ok now we go back to the blue 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.030
 print web 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.860
 and then upright gear in here 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.020
 we ordered a few things 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.610
 at meppen comeback could attune 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.030
 how much ammo should we have for 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.980
 example 1000 like simulation in one 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.970
 magazine should be the 200th 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.620
 then we should have pulled and here 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.830
 how fast you can celebrate 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.020
 there come 0.01 then we celebrate 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.550
 pretty fast could then below 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.680
 only the mass meat out if so there 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.090
 to fill practical systems and on the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.740
 trail of the basin as a runway union 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.660
 of course, others might have seen 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.850
 but it is also important to introduce 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.650
 the hiir sounds as could celebration for 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.150
 adjust celebration lux and published 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.600
 sound and all sounds could be too 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.010
 imagine 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.150
 that were some of the most important 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:54.420
 Options separated so there the sounds 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.860
 here around the particle systems directly like 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.340
 many clubs have and here are the ones 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.500
 weapons 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.030
 otherwise not that important 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.650
 is in here but could of course 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.100
 change it a bit already 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.950
 but I have to and now have to 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.630
 go back to our weapon the open 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.590
 but now you need a lot of hard work 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.360
 gamble because we can see here 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.850
 now no flash or actually 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.590
 her at ours down here so at one 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.630
 wrong position and now have to 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.580
 just open to it now 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.800
 again our weapon and the weapons of 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.200
 epic games and here we can see 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.580
 gamers with the name massive is there 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.780
 a right click on it and then 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.370
 rennes go our weapon back then 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.290
 just click it again 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.600
 right click and then ours 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.610
 add socket or old to the age 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.160
 easy control so the name of me 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.380
 before copied a little too well that 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.890
 we had to try it out now and we did 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.290
 can see the dimensions I always flash 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.060
 another wrong position because we are 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.230
 in here 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.330
 the curl tone to the right position 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.310
 bring as in our case that would have 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.470
 here and forwards at the waffles 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.040
 example so that need to go 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.890
 fit 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.280
 At that time , the show was rotating to do so 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.480
 it just has 80 degrees and 90 above 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.930
 grad and there we can do that 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.930
 tried out 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:25.900
 and always in the right position 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:26.169
 have to look this way and see 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.469
 you 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:34.629
 and we gave the wrong name 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:36.520
 so that should fit in. Try it now 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:38.139
 you can already see the mass flash in the 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.930
 correct position if we also aim 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.689
 is also displayed as I said in the blood 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.400
 could also change this system 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.469
 but I'll leave it that way you can 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.090
 there is something else to do but yes 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.039
 All that was not the basics like you 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.479
 replaces the weapon of epic games and how 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.819
 you just a few things in block and 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.210
 fallen head and down to the 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.210
 next time
