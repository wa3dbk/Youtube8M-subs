fixed system it was good it I buy all of
them<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.850> outlast<00:00:48.860> their<00:00:50.240> usefulness<00:00:51.560> life

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.830 

at<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.430> side<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.000> one's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.540> bit

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
at one side of this one's a little bit

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560 
at one side of this one's a little bit
weak<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.590> I've<00:00:59.220> discovered<00:00:59.610> that<00:01:00.060> through

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
weak and I've discovered that through

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
weak and I've discovered that through
testing<00:01:01.200> switching<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.830> water<00:01:02.040> back<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
testing switching the water back and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
testing switching the water back and
forth<00:01:02.690> now<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.960> need<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
forth now you do need to know that but

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
forth now you do need to know that but
the<00:01:05.160> part<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.520> don't<00:01:05.640> need<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.960> how

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the part you don't need to know is how

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.730 
the part you don't need to know is how
many<00:01:07.980> degrees<00:01:08.540> I'm<00:01:09.540> gonna<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:10.050> this<00:01:10.320> quick

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
many degrees I'm gonna make this quick

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.860 
many degrees I'm gonna make this quick
how<00:01:11.430> many<00:01:11.460> degrees<00:01:12.680> before<00:01:14.210> top<00:01:15.210> dead<00:01:15.270> center

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
how many degrees before top dead center

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.720 
how many degrees before top dead center
does<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> two<00:01:16.410> cylinder<00:01:16.830> far<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
does a two cylinder far that's the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.710 
does a two cylinder far that's the
question<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.500> has<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:21.240> been<00:01:21.480> ran

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
question that was that has it's been ran

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.990 
question that was that has it's been ran
up<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> flagpole<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.920> question<00:01:23.430> hands<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
up the flagpole that question hands and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.930 
up the flagpole that question hands and
and<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.660> is<00:01:24.870> this<00:01:25.050> wavy<00:01:25.590> water<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.370> you'll

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
and so is this wavy water here you'll

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.930 
and so is this wavy water here you'll
see<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> you've<00:01:28.140> got<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.010> this

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
see that you've got to have that this

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.000 
see that you've got to have that this
most<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.720> they're<00:01:30.930> made<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.440> copper<00:01:31.860> or

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
most of they're made out of copper or

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.980 
most of they're made out of copper or
some<00:01:32.280> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> bright<00:01:32.880> stuff<00:01:33.330> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
some kind of bright stuff if you get a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.910 
some kind of bright stuff if you get a
factory<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.580> find<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.330> metal

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
factory one but you can find a metal

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.280 
factory one but you can find a metal
replacement<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.250> these<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.910> do<00:01:39.290> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
replacement one of these and you do you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.150 
replacement one of these and you do you
do<00:01:40.530> need<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.960> secure<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.200> somehow<00:01:43.770> because

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
do need to secure one somehow because

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.140 
do need to secure one somehow because
what<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> does

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
what that does

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.410 
what that does
it<00:01:45.900> holds<00:01:46.170> pressure<00:01:46.560> against<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.190> cam<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it holds pressure against your cam so it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.750 
it holds pressure against your cam so it
don't<00:01:48.570> vibrate<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.229> their<00:01:49.500> vibrations<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.580> bad

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
don't vibrate in their vibrations a bad

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.660 
don't vibrate in their vibrations a bad
thing<00:01:51.200> eliminate<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.380> anyway<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.190> can<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
thing eliminate it anyway you can and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
thing eliminate it anyway you can and
that<00:01:53.970> wavy<00:01:54.300> washer<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.050> way<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that wavy washer is the way to do that

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.750 
that wavy washer is the way to do that
the<00:01:56.310> point<00:01:56.700> being<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.950> whole<00:01:59.220> system

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
the point being is this whole system

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.270 
the point being is this whole system
here<00:01:59.910> works<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.800> magnets<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:02.690> magnets<00:02:03.690> is<00:02:03.930> uh

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
here works on magnets and magnets is uh

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.410 
here works on magnets and magnets is uh
well<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.490> don't<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:07.470> magnetism<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.580> itself<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
well we don't it magnetism in itself I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.190 
well we don't it magnetism in itself I
mean<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.140> can't<00:02:10.440> hardly<00:02:10.619> explain<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
mean you can't hardly explain that the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.729 
mean you can't hardly explain that the
reason<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:16.519> solder<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:19.080> spark<00:02:19.470> plug

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
reason you do not solder the spark plug

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.360 
reason you do not solder the spark plug
bars<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.610> these<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:22.500> ears<00:02:22.830> right<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:24.050> is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
bars to these little ears right here is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.030 
bars to these little ears right here is
I'm<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.880> show<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:28.590> happens

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
I'm going to show you now this happens

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.670 
I'm going to show you now this happens
to<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.340> da<00:02:29.730> core<00:02:30.209> here<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to be a da core here there is a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.180 
to be a da core here there is a
difference<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:33.140> dimensions<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.410> I'm

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
difference in this dimensions and I'm

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.780 
difference in this dimensions and I'm
going<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> take<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.180> core<00:02:36.630> off<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.790> armature

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
going to take this core off the armature

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.949 
going to take this core off the armature
is<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.570> reason<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.620> these<00:02:40.920> ears

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
is the reason that I have these ears

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.500 
is the reason that I have these ears
bent<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:44.070> way<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.610> remove<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.269> core

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
bent up that way I can remove the core

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.860 
bent up that way I can remove the core
put<00:02:46.500> another<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.070> back<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.280> there<00:02:47.820> Bend<00:02:48.660> these

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
put another one back on there Bend these

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
put another one back on there Bend these
ends<00:02:49.200> over<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.799> would<00:02:49.950> hold<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.340> facts<00:02:50.580> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
ends over and it would hold it facts I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.789 
ends over and it would hold it facts I
show<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.480> reason<00:02:51.660> now<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.620> don't

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
show you the reason now that you don't

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.300 
show you the reason now that you don't
saw<00:02:53.310> your<00:02:53.489> own<00:02:53.640> necks<00:02:54.320> if<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.560> may<00:02:55.890> try<00:02:56.280> to

good starter well you see to come loose
you've<00:07:02.970> seen<00:07:03.210> it<00:07:03.360> just<00:07:03.600> come<00:07:03.870> it<00:07:04.110> was<00:07:04.290> not

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
you've seen it just come it was not

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:47.669 
now it did not make any difference it's

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.740 
now it did not make any difference it's
over<00:07:47.970> circuit<00:07:48.800> so<00:07:49.800> no<00:07:49.949> no<00:07:50.280> no<00:07:50.639> it's<00:07:51.060> somewhere
