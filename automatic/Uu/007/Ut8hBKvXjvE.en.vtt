right<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.630> oxidation<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.649> these<00:01:47.159> tea

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
right and that's oxidation so these tea

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
right and that's oxidation so these tea
leaves<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.909> start<00:01:48.180> off<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> white<00:01:49.110> or

leaves can hit with oxygen and air and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.039 
leaves can hit with oxygen and air and
begin<00:02:02.100> ox<00:02:02.369> dyeing<00:02:02.729> those<00:02:03.000> tea<00:02:03.180> leaves<00:02:03.420> into<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
begin ox dyeing those tea leaves into a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
begin ox dyeing those tea leaves into a
black<00:02:04.409> team<00:02:04.680> there's<00:02:05.310> also<00:02:05.430> pretty<00:02:05.729> cool<00:02:05.909> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
black team there's also pretty cool is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.469 
black team there's also pretty cool is
that<00:02:06.030> each<00:02:06.360> type<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.670> tea<00:02:08.670> from<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> same

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that each type of tea from the same

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.080 
that each type of tea from the same
plant<00:02:09.750> much<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.440> wine<00:02:10.770> right<00:02:11.220> we're<00:02:11.370> talk

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
plant much like wine right we're talk

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.690 
plant much like wine right we're talk
all<00:02:12.360> wine<00:02:12.780> comes<00:02:13.590> from<00:02:13.680> grapes<00:02:14.070> but<00:02:14.490> there's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
all wine comes from grapes but there's

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.220 
all wine comes from grapes but there's
different<00:02:15.060> types<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.570> grapes<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.020> then

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
different types of grapes and then

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.720 
different types of grapes and then
there's<00:02:16.440> different<00:02:16.560> things<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.520> to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
there's different things you can do to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.510 
there's different things you can do to
the<00:02:17.820> grapes<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.360> make<00:02:19.200> different<00:02:19.770> styles<00:02:20.370> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
the grapes to make different styles of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.630 
the grapes to make different styles of
wines<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.990> green<00:02:22.740> green<00:02:23.340> tea<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.520> a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
wines right so green green tea is a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.450 
wines right so green green tea is a
white<00:02:23.940> wine<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.350> red<00:02:25.410> wine<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.070> think

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
white wine and red wine I think

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.640 
white wine and red wine I think
primarily<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.420> based<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> skin<00:02:28.290> whether

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
primarily is based on the skin whether

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.490 
primarily is based on the skin whether
the<00:02:28.860> skin<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.850> remained<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.840> those<00:02:30.990> grapes

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the skin is remained on those grapes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.270 
the skin is remained on those grapes
so<00:02:32.160> what's<00:02:33.090> pretty<00:02:33.420> cool<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.890> using<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
so what's pretty cool is that using the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.430 
so what's pretty cool is that using the
type<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.550> tea<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.150> use<00:02:36.330> for<00:02:36.540> kombucha<00:02:36.960> will

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
type of tea we use for kombucha will

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.890 
type of tea we use for kombucha will
also<00:02:37.800> yield<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.310> different<00:02:38.820> flavor<00:02:39.210> profile<00:02:39.720> as

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
also yield a different flavor profile as

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.510 
also yield a different flavor profile as
well<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> different<00:02:40.530> health<00:02:40.710> profile<00:02:41.190> for

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
well as a different health profile for

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.320 
well as a different health profile for
example<00:02:41.960> green<00:02:42.960> tea<00:02:43.200> has<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> high<00:02:43.860> amounts<00:02:44.220> of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
example green tea has a high amounts of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.030 
example green tea has a high amounts of
EGCG<00:02:45.330> now<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:45.990> an<00:02:46.080> acronym<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.710> word

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
EGCG now that's an acronym for a word

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.550 
EGCG now that's an acronym for a word
that<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.340> cannot<00:02:47.730> 100%<00:02:48.720> pronounce<00:02:49.260> correctly

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
that I cannot 100% pronounce correctly

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.150 
that I cannot 100% pronounce correctly
so<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.220> will<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.730> leave<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.000> EGC<00:02:51.450> G<00:02:51.720> but<00:02:52.320> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so I will just leave it EGC G but it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.540 
so I will just leave it EGC G but it
also<00:02:53.310> tea<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.570> green<00:02:54.870> tea<00:02:55.020> also<00:02:55.170> has<00:02:55.410> tends<00:02:56.340> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
also tea of green tea also has tends to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.650 
also tea of green tea also has tends to
depending<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> type<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.390> green<00:02:57.540> tea

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
depending on the type of green tea

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.660 
depending on the type of green tea
higher<00:02:58.170> levels<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.710> antioxidants<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.550> is

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
higher levels of antioxidants now is

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.490 
higher levels of antioxidants now is
that<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.940> say<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> black<00:03:00.750> tea<00:03:01.020> then<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.290> worse

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
that to say that black tea then is worse

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.170 
that to say that black tea then is worse
no<00:03:01.740> because<00:03:01.920> black<00:03:02.160> tea<00:03:02.310> has<00:03:02.340> other<00:03:02.640> things<00:03:03.030> in

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
no because black tea has other things in

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.020 
no because black tea has other things in
it<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.450> green<00:03:04.140> tea<00:03:04.320> does<00:03:04.470> not<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.310> few

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it that green tea does not so a few

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.180 
it that green tea does not so a few
things<00:03:06.060> one<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.110> would<00:03:07.410> recommend<00:03:07.980> if

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
things one is I would recommend if

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.100 
things one is I would recommend if

brewing education and and kombucha doing
not<00:03:29.880> just<00:03:29.910> kombucha<00:03:30.450> rooming<00:03:30.959> education<00:03:31.380> but

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
not just kombucha rooming education but

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.260 
not just kombucha rooming education but
you're<00:03:31.560> actually<00:03:31.800> doing<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.220> stuff<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.640> to

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
you're actually doing this stuff is to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.860 
you're actually doing this stuff is to
brew<00:03:33.600> one<00:03:34.050> batch<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.830> kombucha<00:03:35.630> using<00:03:36.630> green

brew one batch of kombucha using green

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.690 
brew one batch of kombucha using green
tea<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.709> another<00:03:37.920> batch<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.190> kombucha

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
tea and do another batch of kombucha

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.510 
tea and do another batch of kombucha
using<00:03:39.060> black<00:03:39.239> tea<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.780> idea<00:03:40.140> of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
using black tea and this idea of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.430 
using black tea and this idea of
experimenting<00:03:41.520> can<00:03:42.090> be<00:03:42.270> taken<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.140> using

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
experimenting can be taken to then using

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.350 
experimenting can be taken to then using
other<00:03:43.650> teas<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.190> well<00:03:44.550> as<00:03:44.700> when<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> get<00:03:45.239> into

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
other teas as well as when you get into

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.270 
other teas as well as when you get into
more<00:03:45.450> advanced<00:03:45.900> brewing<00:03:46.320> combining<00:03:47.160> these
