county<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.569> anywhere

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
county they're in so it can be anywhere

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.029

from<00:02:08.119> every<00:02:09.119> two<00:02:09.300> weeks<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.810> once<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.500> month<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
from every two weeks to once a month I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.040 
from every two weeks to once a month I
think<00:02:11.730> most<00:02:11.910> column<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.390> probably<00:02:12.630> once<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
think most column is probably once a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.670 
think most column is probably once a
month<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.800> should<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> record

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
month they should have a record

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.830 
month they should have a record
of<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.400> from<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.879> company<00:02:16.299> that<00:02:16.510> does<00:02:16.689> this

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
of this from the company that does this
