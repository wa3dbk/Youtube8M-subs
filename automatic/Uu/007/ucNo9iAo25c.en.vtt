dreadlocks<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.310> swimming<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
dreadlocks is if you're swimming in a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.410 
dreadlocks is if you're swimming in a
chlorinated<00:01:33.450> pool<00:01:34.220> because<00:01:35.220> chlorine<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
chlorinated pool because chlorine is a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
chlorinated pool because chlorine is a
beast<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.500> our<00:01:37.799> hair<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> beast<00:01:38.520> on

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
beast on our hair it's a beast on

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.819 
beast on our hair it's a beast on
anybody's<00:01:39.150> hair<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.320> naturally

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
anybody's hair but if you have naturally

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
anybody's hair but if you have naturally
curly<00:01:41.189> hair<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.850> tend<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> pretty

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
curly hair that can tend to be pretty

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
curly hair that can tend to be pretty
dry<00:01:43.140> anyway<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:44.100> chlorine<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.030> no

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
dry anyway then chlorine will do no

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
dry anyway then chlorine will do no
favours<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> help

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
favours for you it's not going to help

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.139 
favours for you it's not going to help
you<00:01:47.520> out<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.790> all

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you out at all

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
you out at all
so<00:01:48.390> since<00:01:48.840> chlorine<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.590> an<00:01:49.740> entirely

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so since chlorine is an entirely

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.249 
so since chlorine is an entirely
different<00:01:50.729> beast<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.299> does<00:01:51.479> require<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.899> little

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
different beast it does require a little

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.219 
different beast it does require a little
bit<00:01:52.409> more<00:01:52.790> preventative<00:01:53.790> maintenance

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
bit more preventative maintenance

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.990 
bit more preventative maintenance
what'll<00:01:55.229> happen<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.799> chlorine<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.759> hair

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
what'll happen with chlorine in my hair

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
what'll happen with chlorine in my hair
anyway<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> started<00:01:58.380> locking

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
anyway is that when I started locking

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.980 
anyway is that when I started locking
process<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.700> chlorine<00:02:00.119> dried<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.750> hair

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
process the chlorine dried out my hair

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.709 
process the chlorine dried out my hair
so<00:02:01.439> much<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> degree<00:02:02.700> having<00:02:03.210> my<00:02:03.479> hair<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so much and to a degree having my hair a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.090 
so much and to a degree having my hair a
little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.079> drier<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.560> nice<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
little bit drier it was nice because it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
little bit drier it was nice because it
helped<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> bind<00:02:05.729> better<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.049> also

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
helped it bind better but then it also

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
helped it bind better but then it also
turned<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.740> into<00:02:07.890> something<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.369> felt<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
turned it into something that felt a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.809 
turned it into something that felt a
little<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.270> like

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
little bit more like

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.380 
little bit more like
hay<00:02:10.179> or<00:02:10.569> straw<00:02:10.659> the<00:02:11.290> nice<00:02:11.499> smooth<00:02:12.150> silky<00:02:13.150> locks

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
hay or straw the nice smooth silky locks

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.780 
hay or straw the nice smooth silky locks
so<00:02:13.719> that's<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.079> downside<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.889> in<00:02:15.129> addition<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so that's a downside so in addition to

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.970 
so that's a downside so in addition to
drying<00:02:16.180> out<00:02:16.420> your<00:02:16.450> hair<00:02:16.870> chlorine<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:17.829> also

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
drying out your hair chlorine can also

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.410 
drying out your hair chlorine can also
change<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.549> color<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.939> your<00:02:19.180> hair

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
change the color of your hair

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.910 
change the color of your hair
you<00:02:19.780> can't<00:02:20.019> see<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:20.319> now<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:20.769> I'm

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you can't see it right now because I'm

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.509 
you can't see it right now because I'm
not<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.219> direct<00:02:21.400> sunlight<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:22.599> probably<00:02:23.049> from

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
not in direct sunlight but probably from

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.940 
not in direct sunlight but probably from
here<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.659> my<00:02:25.870> hair<00:02:26.139> is<00:02:26.409> a<00:02:26.439> little<00:02:26.680> bit

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
here to here on my hair is a little bit

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.949 
here to here on my hair is a little bit
more<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.489> reddish<00:02:27.760> brown<00:02:28.180> color<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
more of a reddish brown color and the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.050 
more of a reddish brown color and the
rest<00:02:29.109> of<00:02:29.349> my<00:02:29.469> hair<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.950> more<00:02:30.159> brownish<00:02:30.819> black

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
rest of my hair is more brownish black

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.809 
rest of my hair is more brownish black
and<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:32.079> from<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.530> chlorine<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:33.790> I

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
and that's from the chlorine when I

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.520 
and that's from the chlorine when I
first<00:02:34.150> started<00:02:34.389> doing<00:02:34.659> my<00:02:34.810> locs<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.170> was<00:02:35.290> also

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
first started doing my locs I was also

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.110 
first started doing my locs I was also
taking<00:02:35.889> swim<00:02:36.159> lessons<00:02:36.549> which<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.849> really

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
taking swim lessons which is really

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.149 
taking swim lessons which is really
stupid<00:02:37.510> combination<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.439> events<00:02:38.799> but<00:02:38.980> that's

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
stupid combination of events but that's

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.190 
stupid combination of events but that's
just<00:02:39.310> what<00:02:39.489> happened<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:39.999> it<00:02:40.780> changed<00:02:41.109> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
just what happened and it changed the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.949 
just what happened and it changed the
color<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.469> my<00:02:41.739> hair<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:42.299> those<00:02:43.299> are<00:02:43.510> two<00:02:43.689> things

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
color of my hair so those are two things

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.209 
color of my hair so those are two things
that<00:02:44.049> you'll<00:02:44.260> want<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.530> protect<00:02:44.739> against

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
that you'll want to protect against

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.250 
that you'll want to protect against
dryness<00:02:45.939> and<00:02:46.329> just<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.629> way<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.959> chlorine

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
dryness and just the way that chlorine

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.869 
dryness and just the way that chlorine
affects<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.829> color<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.219> your<00:02:48.340> hair<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.760> there

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
affects the color of your hair so there

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.280 
affects the color of your hair so there
are<00:02:48.939> two<00:02:49.150> things<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.659> can<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.019> think

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
are two things that you can do I think

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.439 
are two things that you can do I think
that<00:02:51.069> can<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.489> help<00:02:51.730> protect<00:02:52.150> your<00:02:52.299> hair

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:52.449 
that can really help protect your hair

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.770 
that can really help protect your hair
the<00:02:53.230> first<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.919> to<00:02:54.069> get<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.519> hair<00:02:54.849> wet<00:02:55.239> with

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the first is to get your hair wet with

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170 
the first is to get your hair wet with
regular<00:02:56.290> water<00:02:56.370> before<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.609> get<00:02:57.790> into<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
regular water before you get into the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.119 
regular water before you get into the
pool<00:02:58.329> with<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.659> chlorine<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.590> what<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.889> does

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
pool with the chlorine so what that does

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.039 
pool with the chlorine so what that does
is<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.489> your<00:03:00.849> hair<00:03:01.120> will<00:03:01.329> absorb<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
is that your hair will absorb the

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.259 
is that your hair will absorb the
regular<00:03:02.620> tap<00:03:03.010> water<00:03:03.040> or<00:03:03.609> whatever<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.090> that

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
regular tap water or whatever it is that

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.720 
regular tap water or whatever it is that
you're<00:03:04.359> using<00:03:04.389> and<00:03:05.049> it'll<00:03:05.650> sort<00:03:05.919> of<00:03:06.010> saturate

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
you're using and it'll sort of saturate

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.819 
you're using and it'll sort of saturate
with<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.359> water<00:03:07.689> instead<00:03:08.109> of<00:03:08.169> soaking<00:03:08.739> up

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
with that water instead of soaking up

that that kind of helps secondly I would
recommend<00:03:13.569> finding<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.959> swim<00:03:14.199> cap<00:03:14.439> now<00:03:14.859> the

I<00:04:34.150> didn't<00:04:34.810> find<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.139> helped<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.620> whole<00:04:35.650> lot

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
I didn't find that helped a whole lot

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.580 
I didn't find that helped a whole lot
what<00:04:36.310> happened<00:04:36.729> is<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.840> conditioner

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
what happened is that the conditioner

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.379 
what happened is that the conditioner
would<00:04:38.740> be<00:04:38.919> like<00:04:39.100> rinsing<00:04:39.639> out<00:04:39.789> in<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.180> pool

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
would be like rinsing out in the pool

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.890 
would be like rinsing out in the pool
and<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:40.960> my<00:04:41.169> eyes<00:04:41.199> and<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.550> didn't<00:04:43.000> really

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
and in my eyes and that didn't really

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.930 
and in my eyes and that didn't really
seem<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.259> do<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.830> whole<00:04:45.070> lot<00:04:45.100> of<00:04:45.280> benefit<00:04:45.699> for<00:04:45.850> me

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
seem to do a whole lot of benefit for me

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.219 
seem to do a whole lot of benefit for me
so<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.120> don't<00:04:46.360> recommend<00:04:46.449> it<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.990> might<00:04:47.080> work

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
so I don't recommend it it might work

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.100 
so I don't recommend it it might work
for<00:04:47.440> some<00:04:47.560> people<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.970> some<00:04:49.539> other<00:04:49.720> people

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
for some people and some other people

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.749 
for some people and some other people
would<00:04:50.229> just<00:04:50.470> recommend<00:04:50.680> not<00:04:51.220> swimming<00:04:51.580> in

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
would just recommend not swimming in

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.390 
would just recommend not swimming in
chlorinated<00:04:52.389> pools<00:04:52.630> at<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:52.960> that's<00:04:53.919> probably

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
chlorinated pools at all that's probably

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.990 
chlorinated pools at all that's probably
your<00:04:54.550> best<00:04:54.699> bet

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
your best bet

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.939 
your best bet
I<00:04:55.150> named<00:04:55.449> four<00:04:55.660> natural<00:04:55.960> bodies<00:04:56.289> of<00:04:56.470> water<00:04:56.680> if

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
I named four natural bodies of water if

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.379 
I named four natural bodies of water if
possible<00:04:57.520> but<00:04:57.669> if<00:04:57.729> you're<00:04:57.910> going<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.090> be<00:04:58.180> in<00:04:58.300> a

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
possible but if you're going to be in a

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.790 
possible but if you're going to be in a
pool<00:04:58.599> then<00:04:58.810> those<00:04:58.960> two<00:04:59.139> things<00:04:59.349> would<00:04:59.590> really

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
pool then those two things would really

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.820 
pool then those two things would really
help<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:01.240> once<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:01.599> get<00:05:01.780> out<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.380> pool<00:05:02.560> I

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
help so once you get out of the pool I

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.219 
help so once you get out of the pool I
recommend<00:05:03.400> using<00:05:03.639> a<00:05:03.910> clarifying<00:05:04.449> or

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
recommend using a clarifying or

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.980 
recommend using a clarifying or
chelating<00:05:05.710> shampoo<00:05:06.280> every<00:05:07.120> couple<00:05:07.419> of<00:05:07.570> washes

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
chelating shampoo every couple of washes

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.540 
chelating shampoo every couple of washes
you<00:05:08.199> might<00:05:08.320> not<00:05:08.500> need<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.770> do<00:05:08.889> it<00:05:08.919> every<00:05:09.190> single

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
you might not need to do it every single

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.950 
you might not need to do it every single
wash<00:05:09.849> because<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.270> might<00:05:10.389> be<00:05:10.419> too<00:05:10.660> much<00:05:10.780> for

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
wash because that might be too much for

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.300 
wash because that might be too much for
your<00:05:11.050> hair<00:05:11.259> and<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.470> might<00:05:11.590> just<00:05:11.770> make<00:05:11.919> it<00:05:11.979> dry

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
your hair and it might just make it dry

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.430 
your hair and it might just make it dry
and<00:05:12.520> damage<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.060> further<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:13.960> do<00:05:14.050> recommend

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
and damage it further but I do recommend

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.950 
and damage it further but I do recommend
using<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:15.250> clarifying<00:05:15.820> shampoo<00:05:15.960> occasionally

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
using a clarifying shampoo occasionally

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.120 
using a clarifying shampoo occasionally
especially<00:05:17.199> if<00:05:17.560> you're<00:05:17.680> going<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.979> be<00:05:18.070> in

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
especially if you're going to be in

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.249 
especially if you're going to be in
chlorinated<00:05:18.430> water<00:05:18.729> often<00:05:19.539> I<00:05:19.720> have<00:05:20.020> never

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
chlorinated water often I have never

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.670 
chlorinated water often I have never
found<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.979> clarifying<00:05:21.820> natural<00:05:22.750> shampoo<00:05:23.199> there

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
found a clarifying natural shampoo there

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.800 
found a clarifying natural shampoo there
might<00:05:23.889> be<00:05:23.919> one<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.430> market<00:05:24.550> but<00:05:25.300> I'm<00:05:25.479> not

might be one on the market but I'm not

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
the comments section below how to really

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.950 
the comments section below how to really
appreciate<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:30.610> but<00:05:31.419> if<00:05:31.570> you're<00:05:31.690> going<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.870> be

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
appreciate it but if you're going to be

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.600 
appreciate it but if you're going to be
using<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.349> clarifying<00:05:32.889> shampoo<00:05:33.039> you'll

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
using a clarifying shampoo you'll

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.580 
using a clarifying shampoo you'll
probably<00:05:33.820> swing<00:05:34.449> on<00:05:34.630> over<00:05:34.659> to<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.289> side<00:05:35.440> of

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
probably swing on over to the side of

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.810 
probably swing on over to the side of
the<00:05:35.650> store<00:05:35.830> where<00:05:36.039> they<00:05:36.159> sell<00:05:36.370> all<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
the store where they sell all the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.089 
the store where they sell all the
conventional<00:05:37.360> products<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.590> recommend

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
conventional products and I recommend

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.219 
conventional products and I recommend
this<00:05:39.220> one<00:05:39.280> by<00:05:39.550> Paul<00:05:39.789> Mitchell<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.810> didn't<00:05:41.110> cost

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
this one by Paul Mitchell it didn't cost

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.629 
this one by Paul Mitchell it didn't cost
you<00:05:41.409> much<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.710> want<00:05:41.889> to<00:05:41.949> say<00:05:42.039> that<00:05:42.159> I<00:05:42.220> got<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.550> at

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
you much I want to say that I got it at

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.210 
you much I want to say that I got it at
Ulta<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:43.030> this<00:05:43.389> one<00:05:43.599> was<00:05:43.840> like<00:05:44.380> twelve

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
Ulta and this one was like twelve

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.339 
Ulta and this one was like twelve
dollars<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.240> conditioner<00:05:46.659> cost<00:05:46.900> more<00:05:47.139> so

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
dollars the conditioner cost more so

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.110 
dollars the conditioner cost more so
that<00:05:47.470> was<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.620> little<00:05:47.770> annoying<00:05:48.010> and<00:05:48.909> the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
that was a little annoying and the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.339 
that was a little annoying and the
conditioner<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:50.110> comes<00:05:50.650> with<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:51.039> now<00:05:51.190> this

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
conditioner that comes with it now this

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.080 
conditioner that comes with it now this
actually<00:05:53.349> says<00:05:53.500> clarifying<00:05:53.979> shampoo<00:05:54.520> whereas

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
actually says clarifying shampoo whereas

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.460 
actually says clarifying shampoo whereas
there's<00:05:55.270> no<00:05:55.389> such<00:05:55.630> thing<00:05:55.780> as<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.930> clarifying

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
there's no such thing as a clarifying

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.290 
there's no such thing as a clarifying
moisturizer<00:05:57.220> so<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:57.610> just<00:05:57.820> got<00:05:57.940> something<00:05:58.150> in

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
moisturizer so I just got something in

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.520 
moisturizer so I just got something in
the<00:05:58.419> same<00:05:58.630> line<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.199> seems<00:05:59.380> to<00:05:59.500> work

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
the same line and it seems to work

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.550 
the same line and it seems to work
together<00:05:59.830> pretty<00:06:00.310> well<00:06:00.900> with<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.050> clarifying

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
together pretty well with the clarifying

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.560 
together pretty well with the clarifying
shampoo<00:06:03.159> it<00:06:03.310> has<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.490> really<00:06:03.729> great<00:06:03.909> smell<00:06:04.300> it

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
shampoo it has a really great smell it

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.210 
shampoo it has a really great smell it
takes<00:06:04.870> out<00:06:05.050> all<00:06:05.199> of<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.590> residue<00:06:06.009> that<00:06:06.159> you

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
takes out all of the residue that you

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.159 
takes out all of the residue that you
could<00:06:06.340> possibly<00:06:06.520> have<00:06:07.030> from<00:06:07.479> the<00:06:07.570> chlorine<00:06:07.780> I

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
could possibly have from the chlorine I

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.200 
could possibly have from the chlorine I
would<00:06:08.349> say<00:06:08.530> takes<00:06:09.280> it<00:06:09.400> all<00:06:09.490> out<00:06:09.699> I<00:06:09.729> didn't<00:06:10.090> have

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
would say takes it all out I didn't have

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.580 
would say takes it all out I didn't have
any<00:06:10.389> problems<00:06:10.750> with<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.960> afterwards

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
any problems with it afterwards

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.730 
any problems with it afterwards
um<00:06:11.770> takes<00:06:12.729> out<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:13.030> chlorine<00:06:13.330> smell<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.500> just
