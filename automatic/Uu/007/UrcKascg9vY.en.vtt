out there's probably a pretty good
chance<00:03:10.189> that<00:03:10.310> they'll<00:03:10.489> drop<00:03:10.669> and<00:03:11.030> if<00:03:11.599> you're

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
chance that they'll drop and if you're

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.000 
chance that they'll drop and if you're
patient<00:03:12.199> in<00:03:12.260> those<00:03:12.409> filters<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.980> can

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
patient in those filters you can

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.199 
patient in those filters you can
probably<00:03:13.280> find<00:03:13.519> them<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:13.909> like<00:03:14.030> eight

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
probably find them for like eight

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.539 
probably find them for like eight
thousand<00:03:14.629> coins<00:03:14.949> here's<00:03:15.949> a<00:03:16.010> really<00:03:16.250> cool

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
thousand coins here's a really cool

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.129 
thousand coins here's a really cool
thing<00:03:16.609> that<00:03:16.879> I<00:03:17.060> would<00:03:17.239> recommend<00:03:17.659> doing<00:03:17.810> if

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
thing that I would recommend doing if

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.780 
thing that I would recommend doing if
you<00:03:18.290> really<00:03:18.560> just<00:03:18.739> can't<00:03:19.159> get<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> hang<00:03:19.669> of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
you really just can't get a hang of

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.390 
you really just can't get a hang of
sniping<00:03:20.150> there's<00:03:20.870> an<00:03:20.989> Antonio<00:03:21.470> Gates<00:03:21.709> 85

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
sniping there's an Antonio Gates 85

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.369 
sniping there's an Antonio Gates 85
which<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.419> the<00:03:23.509> rookie<00:03:23.780> legend<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.229> then

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
which is the rookie legend and then

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.140 
which is the rookie legend and then
there's<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> regular<00:03:25.040> veteran<00:03:25.519> Antonio<00:03:25.970> gage

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
there's a regular veteran Antonio gage

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.699 
there's a regular veteran Antonio gage
so<00:03:26.269> there's<00:03:26.449> no<00:03:26.599> way<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.810> differentiate<00:03:27.290> them

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
so there's no way to differentiate them

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.409 
so there's no way to differentiate them
I<00:03:27.919> mean<00:03:28.250> other<00:03:28.430> than<00:03:28.579> looking<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.209> can't

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
I mean other than looking so you can't

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.270 
I mean other than looking so you can't
make<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.569> filter<00:03:29.870> for<00:03:30.199> him<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:30.769> basically<00:03:31.069> you

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
make a filter for him so basically you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.069 
make a filter for him so basically you
could<00:03:31.400> plug<00:03:31.609> in<00:03:31.759> Antonio<00:03:32.000> Gates<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:32.629> find<00:03:32.900> the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
could plug in Antonio Gates and find the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.749 
could plug in Antonio Gates and find the
super<00:03:33.409> good<00:03:33.560> one<00:03:33.739> for<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> really<00:03:34.639> low

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:34.759 
super good one for like a really low

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.939 
super good one for like a really low
price<00:03:34.939> I<00:03:35.299> really<00:03:36.169> hope<00:03:36.290> these<00:03:36.439> filters<00:03:36.829> do

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
price I really hope these filters do

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.530 
price I really hope these filters do
