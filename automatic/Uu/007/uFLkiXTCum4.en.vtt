00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 chain3 television too and good the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.189
 Yesterday I will tell you how it arises 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.769
 this salad but it's a little 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.740
 different I will use a rice that is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.630
 completely different is tuberose 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.050
 basmati is called basmati because it is a 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.270
 rice look very long and skinny 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 It is very beautiful and tastes delicious is something 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 a little jasmine I would like to use it in 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.029
 I found anywhere in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 find in any super salt you can 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.050
 find but if you have rice from 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 normal you can also make this recipe 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 it's that easy if not yes, it does all 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.989
 the steps and nothing else to make the salad 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.700
 with the income that we are going to use 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.260
 You can also do it because I myself 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 happened because I stay a lot of rice on 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 yesterday at lunch and I thought 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 good idea to make a rice salad 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.640
 we will do it with broth 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.000
 let's record a pan and I'll put 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.040
 cumin 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.680
 and I will move it very fast 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.210
 until you release the aroma in this 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 moment this animal jumping suns 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.900
 jumping we are getting the scent 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.000
 average indigenous we remove ok ok it 's very 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.320
 fast is very very fast in time 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.220
 which is the obvious that we did it is in the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.620
 real time 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 ok ok because it burns me and know 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.370
 completely full that lemon vat and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 olive oil 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.000
 of course salt 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.020
 and let's mix what I'm doing 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.610
 a little bit far from me because I'm going to occupy 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.240
 this whole table 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.040
 to this we have our first step of the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 right with this let's dress 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.040
 we are going now 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.960
 you also rice the ingredients of the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.180
 dishes that cost me more work and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.810
 surely many people also almost 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.130
 always the recipe is 2 x average water 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.120
 for a rice almost always but now 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.190
 everything has changed 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.400
 for example this rice needs nothing more 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.250
 two cups of water for one of rice you 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.440
 He has practiced it because he has 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 My mom gives me a sadness to say it but 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.080
 I'm always technically I do not know why 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.370
 I make the exact recipes my aunt does 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 for you who is an expert in the kitchen 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.780
 leave a room from Aunt Skate's and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.130
 it's really collective 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.780
 sorry I 'm telling you but it's been 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.790
 flour tortillas I'm going to like that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.410
 arrive to come and do them because 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.930
 it's a delightful version this holy week 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.320
 headquarters swallowed it does not not attend to us 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.320
 respect 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.640
 well I've measured it and comes out 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.680
 well and then I get it doing it the same 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.540
 equal mannequin and passes by equal 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.700
 but good usually happens in the kitchen 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 so we are not going to put a container now 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.120
 at medium heat we are going to prepare this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 delicious rice as I do it for 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.160
 being set up again is going to put the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.660
 cumin turmeric 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.660
 very fast water 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.849
 the aroma came out 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.190
 very well is a different voice I already said 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:09.450
 in this rice 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:13.739
 salt amount I'll wait for it to boil 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.900
 ok a few minutes and as soon as 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.700
 boil let's add the rice that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.950
 we need several salad me here 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.860
 I have a rice that we can see it is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.989
 completely yellowish tastes like turmeric 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.860
 it tastes like cumin and it's ready 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.870
 put the onion chop on these 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.700
 habits are delicious I like it a lot 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.620
 more than the onion I always his and 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.940
 I'm very supportive of that, it seems to me that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.299
 to people that I like onion is 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.299
 a good alternative 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.690
 is ready to use this onion of 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.970
 Cambrai will not throw them a 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.650
 anything else organic norm is 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.049
 look up now for example in the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.110
 recipe does not take them but I could 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.209
 put in my rice takes a little taste 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.860
 different to the best, he won the taste 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.660
 combine turmeric because it tastes a lot 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.370
 stronger but like that but I do not know in your 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.190
 home if I will not throw please 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:17.050
 no reason 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:17.050
 a habitat of onion and minced ribbon 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.099
 very different we are going to lay foundations myself 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.499
 I did not work much I went to the super and 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.439
 I buy tinned peppers that seem to me 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:33.320
 a very good option so here they are 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:36.470
 since julián and you're pepper has been 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.540
 ready we will make another 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.780
 so that we have enough 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.890
 color are spring colors remember 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.470
 in the spring 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.880
 full of colors everywhere 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.850
 program is very complete we are going to 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.850
 prepare mango cream for the body 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.139
 so good is great we're going to 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.009
 the green pepper 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.229
 let's put cilantro not all that little and 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.610
 I'm going to tell you that I'll be at the last minute 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.499
 currently the program I had the option 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.499
 to put so much chipote to the dressing of 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:09.840
 show slightly different then if 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:17.189
 like to put dressing type here is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:20.219
 and we will put and feel what 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:23.009
 the body receives boost we just 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.849
 change from a simple vinaigrette with 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.560
 cumin a chipotle vinaigrette 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.260
 flavored with cumin and quick and travis 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.960
 I have beans 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.090
 and collision there are three young people who is rich 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.010
 that we put them from last night those and the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.350
 we put it seemed very good idea 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.420
 to put us already knows that to wash them bean 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.480
 first it 's thumb the way my 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.020
 grandmother someone is thumb two already after 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.120
 of inches we are going to wash them with 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.590
 enough soap is very important 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.040
 wash them with a lot of soap 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:59.070
 remember it after we played very well and 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.680
 already rinsed I will tell you that the 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.560
 I put to work all night that did 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.350
 that rice that is a legume is 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.750
 dry it is hydrated a little and the time of 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.670
 cooking in the express pot or in a pot 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.590
 normal is less we are saving gas 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.200
 There are people who directly put my 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.790
 respect that good if we do not pay the 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.920
 same process that our 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:24.090
 grandmothers I am now watching 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.540
 our water is already boiling 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:32.460
 let's sprinkle our rice 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.919
 basmati basmati basmati let's go down 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.949
 at low heat and we go to a technique that 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:41.449
 it's called Simán in English we've already said 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:43.560
 here several times it's slow boil 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.840
 as long as there is a small 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.090
 opening that opening will allow me 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.460
 let the steam come out also and not be a 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.440
 Tosca strong cooking will go 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.940
 slightly knowing each other little by little and 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.370
 get off perfect now we have dressing 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.430
 integral integrated by very softwares 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.260
 well what is going to look great is a 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.530
 complete project complete brass and boats 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.600

 that nothing but delight 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.460
 and this is going to serve on some 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.740
 lettuce beds or we can put with 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.240
