00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.099
 hello how is it at the end of the neighborhood league 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.179
 of this we present a letter of deaths 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.630
 this letter is a variation of the cake of santiago 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.080
 in the only difference is that instead of ground almonds it takes nine 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 first of all we have four new 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.980
 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.050
 200 grams of walnuts about 30 grams of Pedro Ximénez and a little cinnamon 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 also a little hesperia duradero 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.650
 We put the nuts to crush or chop bigger but smaller 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.610
 We need to keep in mind that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.250
 the bigger the website, the more coarse the cake will be 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.370
 i percent below the walnuts will go away once the letter I made 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.970
 6 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.820
 6 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.310
 Yes Yes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.220
 6 once we have nothing that touches 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.540
 i little stops 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.190
 what we will do is mix the sounds 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.960
 the solids is lemon and cinnamon 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.350
 the lemon will put a little bit of zest this will make us 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.259
 refresh the cake a little and give that point to be here ten i a little 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.750
 of cinnamon not much 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.939
 when later we put it darker we will have the letter 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240
 we mix it again a little 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.820
 good for a band we already have the solids mixed and finished 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 now we have to whiten the eggs with the sugar as I said are four 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.150
 eggs 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 for 200 grams of sugar 6 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.930
 yes 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 the state is small but neither in excess 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.590
 because otherwise it would not rise much in the furnace p would fall down the sides 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 more than anything has to be a consistency c 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.180
 once done that what we will do is mix the solids with the egg of the 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.579
 seal 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.540
 we also put the wine 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.179
 el pedro ximénez 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.339
 now I know of data 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:17.979
 we will mix 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.090
 envolvent movements 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.239
 for what 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.819
 then do not download us 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.889
 well once we have this mixed 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.889
 we want it already to expose not in power 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.969
 well once we have 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.559
 everything is in the bush what we will do 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.009
 this 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.999
 of the blows 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.019
 in front 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.250
 and once we have this we put it in the oven the oven has to be 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.239
 preheated to 180 degrees 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.569
 and the tray 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.619
 where we are going to put it also has to be hot 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:55.719
 this letter we have now about 12 13 minutes you know depends on your 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.719
 ornate the ovens are different when these twelve thirteen minutes have passed 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.520
 open the oven look how it's going 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.009
 prick it a little bit so it does not go up much 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.579
 I think about the return because we give it back because normally percent of 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.259
 ovens heat more than one side than other 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:18.089
 and so that we stay the same cooked in the day-meter of him of the letter 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:20.409
 Well, we'll turn it around 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.819
 well we have also taken out of the oven 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.239
 and we've let it cool so we can unmold it 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 yes 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:30.999
 6 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.649
 yes let's see either 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.200
 well I think 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.259
 what did he know 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.730
 good 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.949
 we have explored it with a sugar icing 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.179
 here you have it 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:53.150
 and nothing I hope that you try to do in your homes is a very easy recipe 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.599
 isabel scholarship 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.649
 and you are again accept the league
