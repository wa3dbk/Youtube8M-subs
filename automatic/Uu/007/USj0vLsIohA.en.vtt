00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.879

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.879
 Oh'm level is a good meeting had 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.850

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.480
 Tears 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 4 Yosuke 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.289
 Now this time also started Facility video introduction program vs. 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.289
 Let's go to the original song this time 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.600
 Hiro-chan 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:44.289
 Please introduce the videos posted by everyone in this program for each facility 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.280
 It's such thing called Let's go there it was done this time but everyone is here 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.060
 Den 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.379
 Ueno animal 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:58.090
 Yes 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:03.190
 Including the Ueno Zoo Station small animals that Japan's occur joining the army's number in the Japan's oldest zoo 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:06.940
 I'm such that 500 varieties more than the animal has been bred I also went I still even though 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.190
 I kinda think that I want to prep in everyone's videos Nde never 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.260
 So let's take a look at once 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.090
 Is it out right away ? Is it a funny polar bear? 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:24.049
 Shirokuma-chan 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:29.090
 The temperature of this day is close to 30 degrees in the comment column, of course we humans and animals 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:36.530
 It was, but polar bears swam to feel looks good in the pool 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.080
 You see, you 're showing me a nicely swimming figure that doesn't really feel high pressure 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.620
 But 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 You such a polar bear 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:49.670
 We brink of extinction habitat is degraded under the influence of global warming 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.400
 Therefore, while cooperating with each other at zoos in Japan 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.500
 It is said that we are working on promoting breeding 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.710
 It is really difficult for timers to breed them in places where they do not originally live 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.710
 Hey 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.170
 Ya Jan 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.500
 So what's going on with videos that follow the fun day 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.070
 Thank you for putting in the title of Ueno Zoo 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:21.670
 Please try to be someone who can edit these guys 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:23.560
 And it is Ueno Zoo popular number one giant panda that appeared 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.670
 I'm sleeping 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.610
 This wish is I accidentally 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 Already 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.690
 It feels like it's going to go out in any daytime setting, but pandas that have moved too come out 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:41.280
 It was 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:46.560
 Giant pandas in this Imano Zoo are said to be parents and children 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:54.380
 This giant panda which still has a tremendous column despite the weekdays 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.380
 If you want to see the panda that one and move you want to see slowly is recommended to go to Tomokazu 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.660
 Jan No 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:07.100
 Come the end of the movie wonder if what the heck is up to come to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:09.760
 Active monkeys who are moving around energetically 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.190
 It is a Japanese monkey 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.180
 I have a lot 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:25.430
 Ueno is the first animal in the country to have monkeys 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:30.500
 Among the Japanese monkeys and monkeys that live most in Pita , the group of monkeys at Ueno Zoo is the world's largest 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.420
 It is a monkey that I brought from Shimokita Peninsula, Aomori Prefecture, which is the northern limit . 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.630
 I knew this 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.940
 According to the story of the later Sea Queen, if you look closely at Japanese monkeys etc. 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:46.910
 I understand that monkeys and so on 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:52.870
 It's interesting if you look at the relationship between animals and observe them 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.140
 By all means both Is not it perfect the challenges of everyone's summer students 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.950
 Jan No 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.100
 Since Come and go this time was to pick up the Ueno Zoo 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:07.069
 Other than the giant panda Oker 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.400
 And there is no saying that Kobitoka and so-called three major world beasts are here at Ueno Zoo 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.440
 Ne
