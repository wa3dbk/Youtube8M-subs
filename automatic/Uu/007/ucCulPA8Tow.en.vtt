will say like people who like
battlefield<00:01:42.740> tend<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.250> probably<00:01:43.610> also<00:01:43.790> like

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
battlefield tend to probably also like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.880 
battlefield tend to probably also like
firearms<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.930> people<00:01:45.200> who<00:01:45.320> certain

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
percentage people like firearms are

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.990 
percentage people like firearms are
probably<00:01:48.170> also<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:49.280> know<00:01:49.400> would<00:01:49.640> consider

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
probably also you know would consider

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.490

themselves<00:01:50.210> conservative<00:01:51.020> or<00:01:51.110> right-wing

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
themselves conservative or right-wing

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
honest like that'll feel for is somewhat

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.520 
honest like that'll feel for is somewhat
stale<00:03:42.640> after<00:03:43.060> battlefield<00:03:43.810> 3<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.260> was<00:03:44.380> you

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
stale after battlefield 3 it was you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.310 
stale after battlefield 3 it was you
know<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:44.950> kind<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.280> got<00:03:45.489> 3.5<00:03:46.300> yeah<00:03:46.630> so

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
know it's kind of a got 3.5 yeah so

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.770 
know it's kind of a got 3.5 yeah so
having<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.950> little<00:03:48.670> bit<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.970> fresh<00:03:49.209> take<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
having a little bit of a fresh take and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.260 
having a little bit of a fresh take and
I<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:50.980> admit<00:03:51.070> I'm<00:03:51.400> somewhat<00:03:51.790> confident

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
I have to admit I'm somewhat confident

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.150 
I have to admit I'm somewhat confident
about<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.660> look<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.290> single-player<00:03:53.890> I

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
about the look of this single-player I

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.570 
about the look of this single-player I
mean<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:54.970> didn't<00:03:55.270> even<00:03:55.620> click<00:03:56.620> campaign<00:03:57.280> on

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
mean I didn't even click campaign on

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.880 
mean I didn't even click campaign on
battlefield<00:03:58.060> 4<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:59.200> only<00:03:59.440> maybe<00:03:59.680> got

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
battlefield 4 and I only maybe got

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.949 
battlefield 4 and I only maybe got
halfway<00:04:00.160> through<00:04:00.430> three<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:00.970> mean<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.360> don't<00:04:01.630> I

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
halfway through three I mean I don't I

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.320 
halfway through three I mean I don't I
feel<00:04:02.140> like<00:04:02.320> they<00:04:02.470> were<00:04:02.790> not<00:04:03.790> making<00:04:04.209> very

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
feel like they were not making very

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.060 
feel like they were not making very
compelling<00:04:04.870> characters<00:04:05.290> or<00:04:05.470> story<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.950> way

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
compelling characters or story the way

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.090 
compelling characters or story the way
like<00:04:06.250> maybe<00:04:06.489> bat<00:04:06.760> company<00:04:07.150> did<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.800> I<00:04:08.830> was

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
like maybe bat company did and so I was

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.170 
like maybe bat company did and so I was
just<00:04:09.130> ready<00:04:09.520> to<00:04:09.610> say<00:04:09.790> forget<00:04:10.060> about

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
just ready to say forget about

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.880 
just ready to say forget about
single-player<00:04:10.840> altogether<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.530> this

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
single-player altogether but this

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.650 
single-player altogether but this
single-player<00:04:12.520> content<00:04:12.760> actually<00:04:13.209> looks<00:04:13.600> a

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
single-player content actually looks a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.000 
single-player content actually looks a
little<00:04:13.690> bit<00:04:13.870> more<00:04:14.110> interesting<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.860> only

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
little bit more interesting the only

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.039 
little bit more interesting the only
funny<00:04:15.190> thing<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.430> saw<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.270> will<00:04:16.810> point

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
funny thing I saw in this I will point

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.300 
funny thing I saw in this I will point
out<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.560> in<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.900> rescue<00:04:19.900> mode<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.739> dude<00:04:21.010> was

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
whatever it's that's trivial the only

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.360 
whatever it's that's trivial the only
thing<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.229> bothered<00:04:42.560> me<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.710> little<00:04:42.860> bit<00:04:43.130> was

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
thing that bothered me a little bit was

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.430 
thing that bothered me a little bit was
that<00:04:43.639> despite<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.690> really<00:04:45.080> kind<00:04:45.289> of

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
that despite the really kind of

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.779 
that despite the really kind of
cool-looking<00:04:45.680> mechanics<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.550> we<00:04:46.639> were

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
cool-looking mechanics that we were

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.980 
cool-looking mechanics that we were
seeing<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.800> there<00:04:49.669> what<00:04:50.210> still<00:04:50.539> wasn't<00:04:50.720> like

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
seeing that there what still wasn't like

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.590 
seeing that there what still wasn't like
a<00:04:51.020> dedication<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.919> realism<00:04:52.400> of<00:04:52.759> like<00:04:53.180> as<00:04:53.330> soon

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
a dedication to realism of like as soon

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.420 
a dedication to realism of like as soon
as<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.440> got<00:04:54.590> past<00:04:54.830> some<00:04:55.009> of<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.190> stealth

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
as like you got past some of the stealth

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.620 
as like you got past some of the stealth
mechanic<00:04:55.910> or<00:04:56.030> some<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.300> marking

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
mechanic or some of the marking

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.960 
mechanic or some of the marking
mechanics<00:04:57.110> all<00:04:57.680> of<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.039> sudden<00:04:58.400> you're<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:58.699> a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
mechanics all of a sudden you're in a

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.800 
mechanics all of a sudden you're in a
gunfight<00:04:59.180> and<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:01.130> know<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.820> destruction<00:05:02.660> is

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
gunfight and you know the destruction is

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.570 
gunfight and you know the destruction is
kind<00:05:03.020> of<00:05:03.080> cool<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.650> effects<00:05:04.160> are<00:05:04.340> kind<00:05:04.520> of

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
kind of cool the effects are kind of

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.920 
kind of cool the effects are kind of
cool<00:05:04.760> but<00:05:05.030> like<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.389> guy<00:05:05.539> is<00:05:05.600> standing

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
cool but like the guy is standing

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.090 
cool but like the guy is standing
straight<00:05:06.380> up<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.620> front<00:05:06.650> of<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:06.979> enemy

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
straight up in front of the enemy

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.760 
straight up in front of the enemy
getting<00:05:07.520> shot<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:08.060> returning<00:05:08.539> fire<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.260> like

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
getting shot and returning fire and like

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.670 
getting shot and returning fire and like
these<00:05:10.010> moments<00:05:10.340> where<00:05:10.789> all<00:05:11.630> of<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:11.990> sudden<00:05:12.350> it

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
these moments where all of a sudden it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.070 
these moments where all of a sudden it
departs<00:05:13.280> from<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.820> sense<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.270> realism<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.990> it

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
departs from a sense of realism and it

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.570 
departs from a sense of realism and it
popped<00:05:15.380> me<00:05:15.620> out<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.770> little<00:05:15.979> bit<00:05:16.190> watching<00:05:16.520> the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
popped me out a little bit watching the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.790 
popped me out a little bit watching the
footage<00:05:16.789> that<00:05:16.910> way<00:05:17.240> especially<00:05:17.449> like<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.680> the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
footage that way especially like in the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.500 
footage that way especially like in the
single-player<00:05:19.130> there<00:05:19.550> was<00:05:19.669> getting<00:05:20.300> cool

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
single-player there was getting cool

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.839 
single-player there was getting cool
mechanic<00:05:20.960> of<00:05:21.110> telling<00:05:21.860> people<00:05:21.889> to<00:05:22.220> freeze<00:05:22.490> and

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
mechanic of telling people to freeze and

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.430 
mechanic of telling people to freeze and
like<00:05:22.970> put<00:05:23.210> up<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:23.449> know<00:05:23.510> put<00:05:23.870> their<00:05:23.990> hands<00:05:24.289> up

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
like put up you know put their hands up

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.370 
like put up you know put their hands up
but<00:05:24.770> like<00:05:25.070> in<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:25.849> context<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:26.930> moment

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
but like in the context of that moment

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.499 
but like in the context of that moment
where<00:05:27.620> you're<00:05:27.860> assaulting<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.849> compound<00:05:29.330> with

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
where you're assaulting a compound with

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
in those gunfights I did notice that

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.990 
in those gunfights I did notice that
they<00:05:42.590> were<00:05:42.710> using<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.190> same<00:05:43.220> mechanics<00:05:43.880> as

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
they were using the same mechanics as

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.969 
they were using the same mechanics as
multiplayer<00:05:44.690> such<00:05:45.050> as<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.260> grappling<00:05:45.740> hook

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
multiplayer such as the grappling hook

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.089 
multiplayer such as the grappling hook
and<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.260> player<00:05:48.530> didn't<00:05:48.800> seem<00:05:48.919> be<00:05:48.979> able

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
and the the player didn't seem be able

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.740 
and the the player didn't seem be able
to<00:05:49.159> take<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.340> lot<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.520> damage<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:50.120> it's<00:05:50.599> good

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
to take a lot of damage so it's good

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.000

like<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:50.930> good<00:05:51.020> single-player<00:05:51.590> campaign

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
like a good single-player campaign

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.950
