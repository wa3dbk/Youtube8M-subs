here to a conference of television
exactly<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.830> think<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.490> first<00:00:08.670> thing<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.000> see

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
exactly I think the first thing to see

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.329 
exactly I think the first thing to see
Nick<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.599> when<00:00:10.080> actually<00:00:10.530> agreed<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.129> do

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:11.339 
Nick is that when actually agreed to do

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.730 
Nick is that when actually agreed to do
it<00:00:11.549> we<00:00:12.269> hadn't<00:00:12.749> predicted<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.379> was<00:00:13.499> going<00:00:13.679> to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
it we hadn't predicted what was going to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.400 
it we hadn't predicted what was going to
happen<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.419> degree<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.719> coverage<00:00:16.200> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
happen to the degree of coverage and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.519 
happen to the degree of coverage and
really<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.460> reason<00:00:17.880> I'm<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.690> primarily

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
really the reason I'm here was primarily

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.230 
really the reason I'm here was primarily
to<00:00:19.769> tell<00:00:20.460> people<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
to tell people that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
to tell people that
Marvin<00:00:21.599> is<00:00:21.689> still<00:00:21.900> missing<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:22.920> still

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
Marvin is still missing and we're still

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
Marvin is still missing and we're still
looking<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.789> her<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.330> particularly<00:00:24.720> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
looking for her and particularly to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.279 
looking for her and particularly to
touch<00:00:25.170> an<00:00:25.320> international<00:00:26.130> audience<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:28.080> what

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
touch an international audience and what

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.259 
touch an international audience and what
I<00:00:28.320> didn't<00:00:28.560> expect<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.580> such<00:00:29.849> intense

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I didn't expect was to be such intense

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.390 
I didn't expect was to be such intense
coverage<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:31.169> the<00:00:31.380> news<00:00:31.529> story<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.160> such<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
coverage of the news story for such a

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.010 
coverage of the news story for such a
long<00:00:32.669> time<00:00:32.750> why<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.810> you<00:00:33.960> think<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.560> I

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
long time why do you think that is I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.729 
long time why do you think that is I
think<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.969> undoubtedly<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:40.170> huge

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
think that there is undoubtedly a huge

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.880 
think that there is undoubtedly a huge
desire<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.760> people<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> feign

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
desire for people to one one to feign

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.670 
desire for people to one one to feign
modeling<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.699> know<00:00:44.850> what's<00:00:45.149> happening

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
modeling but to know what's happening

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.900 
modeling but to know what's happening
but<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.829> clearly<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.699> pressure

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but there clearly is a lot of pressure

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.270 
but there clearly is a lot of pressure
on<00:00:48.180> people<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.660> rate<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:50.070> now

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
on people to rate things just now

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
on people to rate things just now
because<00:00:50.789> they're<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.359> Portugal<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.350> there's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
because they're in Portugal when there's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
because they're in Portugal when there's
not<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:52.980> very<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.730> happening<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
not actually very much happening do you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
not actually very much happening do you
feel<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.649> ways<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.980> you've<00:00:56.219> unleashed

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
feel in some ways that you've unleashed

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
feel in some ways that you've unleashed
a<00:00:56.879> monster<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.570> early<00:00:57.899> stages<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a monster in the very early stages you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.819 
a monster in the very early stages you
were<00:00:58.710> desperate<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.340> publicity<00:00:59.519> and<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
were desperate for publicity and you

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
were desperate for publicity and you
courted<00:01:01.829> publicity<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.760> effectively<00:01:03.329> now

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
courted publicity very effectively now

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.970 
courted publicity very effectively now
do<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> feel<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.230> run<00:01:04.350> away<00:01:04.440> from<00:01:04.590> I

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
do you feel that you run away from I

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.310 
do you feel that you run away from I
think<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.480> far<00:01:06.780> too<00:01:06.840> simplistic

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
think I think that's far too simplistic

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
think I think that's far too simplistic
there<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> huge<00:01:08.310> media<00:01:08.670> presence<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.240> Pride

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
there was a huge media presence in Pride

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.270 
there was a huge media presence in Pride
illusion<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.110> won<00:01:10.350> before<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.130> had

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
illusion they won before we really had

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.570 
illusion they won before we really had
done<00:01:11.460> anything<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.840> did<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.710> make<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
done anything all we did was to make a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
done anything all we did was to make a
conscious<00:01:14.939> decision<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.630> interact<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
conscious decision to interact with the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.340 
conscious decision to interact with the
media<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.570> raise<00:01:18.750> awareness<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
media and to raise awareness of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.640 
media and to raise awareness of
Madeline's<00:01:19.799> disappearance<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.650> never

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
Madeline's disappearance and I never

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.920 
Madeline's disappearance and I never
ever<00:01:22.770> expected<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
ever expected and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
ever expected and
don't<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.100> necessary<00:01:26.520> beneficial<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
don't think it's necessary beneficial to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
don't think it's necessary beneficial to
have<00:01:27.300> constant<00:01:27.990> coverage<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.610> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
have constant coverage and what we just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
have constant coverage and what we just
won<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.570> given<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> huge<00:01:31.740> saturation

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
won is given the huge saturation

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
won is given the huge saturation
particularly<00:01:32.910> in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> UK<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.840> also<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
particularly in the UK and also in

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.920 
particularly in the UK and also in
Portugal<00:01:34.430> what<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.300> want<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.660> do

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
Portugal what we really just want to do

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.470 
Portugal what we really just want to do
I<00:01:37.230> mean<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.310> hope<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.640> never<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.300> but

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
I mean we hope they never get there but

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.720 
I mean we hope they never get there but
it<00:01:40.110> might<00:01:40.170> -<00:01:40.530> no<00:01:40.740> mess<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.190> just<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.580> to
