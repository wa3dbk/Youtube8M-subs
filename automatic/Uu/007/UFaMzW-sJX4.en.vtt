unique weapon in destiny and we're going
to<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.010> why<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.239> basically<00:01:00.989> how

to go into why that is and basically how

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
to go into why that is and basically how

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it works so as you can see here it is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.310 
it works so as you can see here it is
solar<00:01:04.019> damage<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> 323<00:01:05.939> attack<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
solar damage and it has a 323 attack now

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
solar damage and it has a 323 attack now
it<00:01:07.680> says<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> charge<00:01:08.369> rate<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.510> under

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it says the charge rate is just under

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
it says the charge rate is just under
half<00:01:09.900> way<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.549> charge<00:01:11.820> rate

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
half way but really the charge rate

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
half way but really the charge rate
isn't<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.450> factor<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.020> i'll<00:01:13.140> show<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> in

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
isn't a factor and i'll show you that in

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.850 
isn't a factor and i'll show you that in
a<00:01:13.890> second<00:01:14.420> next<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> impact<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> pretty<00:01:16.560> good

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
a second next the impact is pretty good

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
a second next the impact is pretty good
the<00:01:17.100> range<00:01:17.340> stability<00:01:18.060> reloaded<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the range stability reloaded it's a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
the range stability reloaded it's a
unique<00:01:19.470> weapon<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.159> those<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.150> you're

charge time and it fires a single bolt

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.359 
charge time and it fires a single bolt
with<00:01:53.939> each<00:01:54.149> trigger<00:01:54.600> pull<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:56.040> reality

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
with each trigger pull so in reality

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700 
with each trigger pull so in reality
that's<00:01:56.850> basically<00:01:57.420> saying<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that's basically saying that this is a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.550 
that's basically saying that this is a
full<00:01:59.100> auto<00:01:59.399> fusion<00:02:00.240> rifle<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.320> fire

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
full auto fusion rifle so you can fire

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.469 
full auto fusion rifle so you can fire
it<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.950> long<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.759> hold<00:02:02.939> down<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> button

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it as long as you hold down the button

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.310 
it as long as you hold down the button
until<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> reload<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.939> not

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
until you have to reload so it's not

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
until you have to reload so it's not
like<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.740> other<00:02:07.979> ones<00:02:08.399> where<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.030> other

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
like the other ones where the other

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.089 
like the other ones where the other
fusion<00:02:09.509> rifles<00:02:09.929> let's<00:02:10.110> say<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.500> look<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
fusion rifles let's say we look at the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.580 
fusion rifles let's say we look at the
murmur<00:02:11.580> where<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
murmur where you actually have to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
murmur where you actually have to
wait<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> charge<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.690> pretty

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
wait for it to charge up and it's pretty

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.640 
wait for it to charge up and it's pretty
pretty<00:02:16.860> close<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.700> being<00:02:18.239> slow<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.260> charge

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
pretty close to being slow as a charge

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.589 
pretty close to being slow as a charge
right<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> look<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.430> mean<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
right if you look I mean really the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.610 
right if you look I mean really the
charge<00:02:21.840> rates<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:22.200> look<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.560> different

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
charge rates don't look that different

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.830 
charge rates don't look that different
but<00:02:23.340> you're<00:02:23.519> gonna<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> game<00:02:24.569> plate

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
but you're gonna see in the game plate

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.680 
but you're gonna see in the game plate
that<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:25.290> basically<00:02:25.890> firing<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:27.209> any<00:02:27.420> other

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
that I'm basically firing like any other

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.500 
that I'm basically firing like any other
auto<00:02:28.019> rifle<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.739> one<00:02:29.310> big<00:02:29.819> difference<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.360> you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
auto rifle and one big difference as you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.470 
auto rifle and one big difference as you
can<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.129> murmur<00:02:32.400> fusion<00:02:32.940> rifle<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.450> a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
can see is the murmur fusion rifle is a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.949 
can see is the murmur fusion rifle is a
special<00:02:34.080> weapon<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.180> vex<00:02:36.180> math<00:02:36.420> class<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
special weapon and the vex math class is

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.979 
special weapon and the vex math class is
a<00:02:36.989> primary<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:38.120> pretty<00:02:39.120> pretty<00:02:39.660> unique

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
a primary so pretty pretty unique

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.539 
a primary so pretty pretty unique
probably<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.440> most<00:02:40.560> unique<00:02:40.890> weapon<00:02:41.370> in

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
probably the most unique weapon in

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.479 
probably the most unique weapon in
destiny<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.840> we're<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> go<00:02:43.680> over<00:02:43.769> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
destiny so we're going to go over the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.640 
destiny so we're going to go over the
ballistics<00:02:45.480> here<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.079> aggressive

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
ballistics here you have aggressive

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.470 
ballistics here you have aggressive
ballistics<00:02:47.160> more<00:02:47.549> predictable<00:02:48.060> recoil

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
ballistics more predictable recoil

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
ballistics more predictable recoil
enhanced<00:02:49.019> impact<00:02:49.410> shorter<00:02:49.799> range<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.220> more

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
enhanced impact shorter range and more

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.030 
enhanced impact shorter range and more
recoil<00:02:50.910> then<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.500> predictable

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
recoil then we have more predictable

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.089 
recoil then we have more predictable
recoil<00:02:53.489> slight<00:02:54.150> boots<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.989> range<00:02:55.349> an<00:02:55.620> impact

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
recoil slight boots to range an impact

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.880 
recoil slight boots to range an impact
and<00:02:56.280> more<00:02:56.549> recoil<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.239> then<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:58.500> smart

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and more recoil and then we have smart

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.860 
and more recoil and then we have smart
drift<00:02:59.190> control<00:02:59.629> predictable<00:03:00.629> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
drift control predictable and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.170 
drift control predictable and
controllable<00:03:01.110> recoil<00:03:01.799> penalty<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.610> range<00:03:02.819> so

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
controllable recoil penalty to range so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.660 
controllable recoil penalty to range so
really<00:03:04.019> these<00:03:04.319> are<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.190> preference

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
really these are really a preference

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
really these are really a preference
point<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.180> don't<00:03:06.450> see<00:03:06.660> too<00:03:06.870> big<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
point I don't see too big of a

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.490 
point I don't see too big of a
difference<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.829> even<00:03:08.160> make<00:03:08.540> really<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.569> change

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
difference to even make really a change

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
difference to even make really a change
obviously<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> stability<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:11.940> can<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.299> here

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
obviously the stability you can see here

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.600 
obviously the stability you can see here
goes<00:03:12.660> up<00:03:12.870> quite<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.110> bit<00:03:13.379> but<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.069> does<00:03:14.310> decrease

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
goes up quite a bit but it does decrease

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.580 
goes up quite a bit but it does decrease
the<00:03:15.030> range<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.329> impact<00:03:15.690> quite<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> bit<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.440> I'm

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
the range and impact quite a bit so I'm

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250 
the range and impact quite a bit so I'm
not<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:17.129> too<00:03:17.370> big<00:03:17.579> of<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.850> deal<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.209> me<00:03:18.630> its

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
not not too big of a deal to me its

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.170 
not not too big of a deal to me its
overall<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.859> very<00:03:19.980> good<00:03:20.489> weapon<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.000> don't

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
overall a very good weapon you don't

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.849 
overall a very good weapon you don't
have<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.450> worry<00:03:21.660> about<00:03:21.780> these<00:03:22.139> perks<00:03:22.530> here

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
have to worry about these perks here

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.280 
have to worry about these perks here
next<00:03:23.700> we<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:24.000> these<00:03:24.209> end<00:03:24.540> moments<00:03:25.049> one<00:03:25.200> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
next we have these end moments one of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.539 
next we have these end moments one of
the<00:03:25.380> key<00:03:25.560> perks<00:03:25.859> for<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.489> is

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
the key perks for this and this is

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.039 
the key perks for this and this is
causing<00:03:26.910> damage<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.810> weapon

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
causing damage with this weapon

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.650 
causing damage with this weapon
increases<00:03:28.920> its<00:03:29.190> stability<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:30.180> as<00:03:30.450> you're

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
increases its stability so as you're

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.539 
increases its stability so as you're
firing<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.200> hitting<00:03:31.319> your<00:03:31.590> target<00:03:31.620> it's

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
firing and hitting your target it's

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.670 
firing and hitting your target it's
going<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.849> stabilize<00:03:33.480> better<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.230> actually

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
going to stabilize better and actually

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.890 
going to stabilize better and actually
increase<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.579> stability<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.540> that's<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
increase the stability so that's a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.809 
increase the stability so that's a
pretty<00:03:37.139> cool<00:03:37.560> perk<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> gun

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
pretty cool perk to have on a gun

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.259 
pretty cool perk to have on a gun
especially<00:03:39.450> one<00:03:39.569> that<00:03:39.630> originally<00:03:40.440> has<00:03:41.069> a

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
especially one that originally has a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.050 
especially one that originally has a
fairly<00:03:42.269> high<00:03:43.040> recoil<00:03:44.040> when<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.549> firing<00:03:44.819> it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
fairly high recoil when you're firing it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.210 
fairly high recoil when you're firing it
it's<00:03:45.239> not<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:45.480> high<00:03:45.989> obviously<00:03:46.829> as<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> can

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
it's not that high obviously as you can

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.120 
it's not that high obviously as you can
see<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.549> stability<00:03:48.060> but<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.480> will<00:03:48.690> even

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
see the stability but this will even

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.280 
see the stability but this will even
this<00:03:50.130> will<00:03:50.400> even<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.849> out<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.150> make<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.660> much

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
this will even it out and make it a much

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.589 
this will even it out and make it a much
better<00:03:52.620> weapon<00:03:53.069> overall<00:03:53.459> next<00:03:54.299> we<00:03:54.389> have<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
better weapon overall next we have the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.020 
better weapon overall next we have the
upgrade<00:03:55.200> damage<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.859> then<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> second<00:03:56.819> tier

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
upgrade damage and then the second tier

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.120 
upgrade damage and then the second tier
we<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.329> extended<00:03:57.900> mag<00:03:58.139> now<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.620> actually

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
we have extended mag now this actually

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.610 
we have extended mag now this actually
increases<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.209> magazine<00:04:00.690> quite<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.109> bit<00:04:01.349> if<00:04:01.470> we

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
increases the magazine quite a bit if we

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.610 
increases the magazine quite a bit if we
go<00:04:01.799> let's<00:04:02.250> say<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.489> send<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.150> which<00:04:03.630> increases

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
go let's say to send it which increases

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.349 
go let's say to send it which increases
range<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.160> accuracy<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:05.819> see<00:04:06.120> there

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
range and accuracy you can see there

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.800 
range and accuracy you can see there
goes<00:04:06.569> up<00:04:06.959> quite<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.579> but<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:09.000> see<00:04:09.269> it

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
goes up quite a bit but you can see it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.470 
goes up quite a bit but you can see it
goes<00:04:10.079> down<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.650> 21<00:04:11.099> bullets<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.450> magazine

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
goes down to 21 bullets in the magazine

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.640 
goes down to 21 bullets in the magazine
that<00:04:13.049> is<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> big<00:04:13.680> difference<00:04:14.180> then<00:04:15.180> 35<00:04:16.169> as<00:04:16.560> you

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
that is a big difference then 35 as you

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.250 
that is a big difference then 35 as you
can<00:04:16.739> see<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.099> 14<00:04:17.820> more<00:04:18.060> bullets<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.570> have<00:04:18.780> with

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
can see so 14 more bullets you have with

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.279 
can see so 14 more bullets you have with
the<00:04:19.560> extra<00:04:20.099> mag<00:04:20.280> perk<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.239> quite<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> difference

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
the extra mag perk so quite a difference

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.460 
the extra mag perk so quite a difference
I<00:04:22.530> always<00:04:23.400> run<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.090> I

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
I always run this I

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.620 
I always run this I
haven't<00:04:24.980> changed<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.580> one<00:04:25.970> since<00:04:26.270> I've<00:04:26.450> had

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
haven't changed this one since I've had

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.680 
haven't changed this one since I've had
it<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.520> obviously<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.790> we<00:04:28.970> look<00:04:29.180> at<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.420> send

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
it so obviously if we look at the send

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.570 
it so obviously if we look at the send
it<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:30.170> can<00:04:30.350> see<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.620> increases<00:04:31.100> range<00:04:31.370> and

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
it you can see it increases range and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.670 
it you can see it increases range and
accuracy<00:04:31.790> but<00:04:32.300> overall<00:04:32.690> doesn't<00:04:33.380> really

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
accuracy but overall doesn't really

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.210 
accuracy but overall doesn't really
change<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.430> enough<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.600> sway<00:04:36.470> me<00:04:36.710> from<00:04:37.040> the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
change it enough to sway me from the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.250 
change it enough to sway me from the
extended<00:04:37.730> bake<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.240> then<00:04:38.840> we<00:04:39.050> have

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
extended bake and then we have

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.320

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
lightweight when held this weapon grants

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.660 
lightweight when held this weapon grants
plus<00:04:41.660> two<00:04:41.900> character<00:04:42.440> agility<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.130> not<00:04:43.400> too

plus two character agility so not too

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.900 
plus two character agility so not too

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
big of a deal obviously most of us if we

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.340 
big of a deal obviously most of us if we
have<00:04:47.060> this<00:04:47.210> weapon<00:04:47.630> are<00:04:47.840> going<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.050> be<00:04:48.140> using

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
increased for a short period of time so

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.870 
increased for a short period of time so
if<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.780> got<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.020> couple<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.650> enemies<00:05:10.430> in<00:05:10.460> front

be able to kill the others at a faster

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.790 
be able to kill the others at a faster
rate<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.850> more<00:05:17.120> efficiently<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:17.960> crowd

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
rate and more efficiently so crowd

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.350 
rate and more efficiently so crowd
control<00:05:18.919> is<00:05:19.250> a<00:05:19.310> really<00:05:19.520> nice<00:05:19.669> perk<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.150> have

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
control is a really nice perk to have

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.870 
control is a really nice perk to have
it's<00:05:21.020> not<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.440> best<00:05:21.620> out<00:05:21.890> of<00:05:21.919> all<00:05:22.190> perks<00:05:22.580> when

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
it's not the best out of all perks when

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.450 
it's not the best out of all perks when
it<00:05:23.000> comes<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.480> fusion<00:05:24.290> rifles<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:24.919> primary

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
it comes to fusion rifles and primary

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.730 
it comes to fusion rifles and primary
weapons<00:05:25.880> but<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.419> very<00:05:26.660> good<00:05:27.290> and

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
weapons but it is very good and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.270 
weapons but it is very good and
definitely<00:05:28.520> in<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:28.970> top<00:05:29.000> for<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.020> perks<00:05:30.830> for
