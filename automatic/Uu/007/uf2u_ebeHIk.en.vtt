00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
think twilight has cuz steering she

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.190 
think twilight has cuz steering she
doesn't<00:05:21.920> even<00:05:21.980> have<00:05:22.160> wings<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.730> game

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.770 

well<00:05:27.400> ask<00:05:28.400> her<00:05:28.670> she<00:05:29.180> has<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.450> tools<00:05:29.630> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
well ask her she has the tools to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.680 
well ask her she has the tools to
measure<00:05:29.990> all<00:05:30.290> that<00:05:33.250> okay<00:05:34.390> so<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.420> guess<00:05:35.540> we

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
measure all that okay so I guess we

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.180 
measure all that okay so I guess we
might<00:05:35.810> as<00:05:35.870> well<00:05:36.110> take<00:05:36.290> out<00:05:36.530> Trixie's<00:05:36.920> left<00:05:37.100> and

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
might as well take out Trixie's left and

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.410 
might as well take out Trixie's left and
I<00:05:37.220> always<00:05:37.430> switch<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.850> page<00:05:38.060> even<00:05:38.240> though

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
I always switch the page even though

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.140 
I always switch the page even though
it's<00:05:38.600> right<00:05:38.840> beside<00:05:39.050> Twilight's<00:05:39.710> weapon

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150

if<00:05:55.220> that's<00:05:55.460> this<00:05:55.820> is<00:05:55.940> actually<00:05:56.210> good<00:05:56.300> weakness

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
if that's this is actually good weakness

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.540 
if that's this is actually good weakness
in<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.750> game<00:05:56.930> or<00:05:57.740> is<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:57.980> taking<00:05:58.190> off<00:05:58.340> more
