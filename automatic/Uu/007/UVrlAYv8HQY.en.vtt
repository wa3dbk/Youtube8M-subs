 Hi

 we are blogs like we do not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.679
 comic books 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.839
 we think comics in 2010 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.699
 we create the blog because we realize that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.100
 women are poorly represented in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.109
 comics on hqs 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.410
 we are saved by our hero 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.960
 beautiful thin and hot focuses are his 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 era was wrong for four years 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.930
 we advocate and create means 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 to show that women write 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.270
 drawing law 4 years and deserves to be well 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.969
 represented with everything else but let's 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.460
 focus on the comics until today only 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.860
 we stay online for our lives events 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.719
 and more embu tex facts never 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.940
 we combined a meeting with pomp and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 circumstance to create together 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.590
 thinking to discuss rethink risk 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.530
 that's why we need your help the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.489
 first meeting laws count 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 transgressing the female representation 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.420
 in the comics will be a day of debates 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.950
 with workshop panel display 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 interventions our goal is to bring together 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 people who want to subvert the presentation 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 the hqs and create means of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.210
 programming will be the expense 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.880

 other details to sit all this at 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 People need some money. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.150
 we estimate that it will be necessary to collect 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.430
 16 thousand reais so that everything works out in the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.200
