00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.980
 Let's talk about another one now . 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.559
 mp 500 update 1.40 function that 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.350
 is with turbo pressure control 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.440
 that they control is a 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.360
 Turbo pressure control the image 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.120
 open call or people 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.070
 program the opening day percentage of the 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.810
 bush valve 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.520
 this will make them suggest 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.370
 different pressures in each car 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.800
 but a very simple and easy way 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.900
 to set up a street car one 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.210
 pressure of everything for example rpm 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.970
 then existed in the previous version of 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.950
 up to 500 that control per rpm that is 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 indicates how much percent you want 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.820
 place the entrepreneur according to the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.210
 pm with this doing for example a 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.050
 overboost for example typing with 80% of 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.840
 opening of the valve uesc up to 2,600 and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.960
 for example from 4,000 indian it to me 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:08.500
 I want 50% and then at 57 thousand 508 thousand I 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 I'll put 30% to reduce the pressure 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.959
 I can make a statement and 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.380
 whether I'm going to have a higher 

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:19.119
 beginning will force the giant shell 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.679
 ends faster because it reduces 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.749
 maintains a certain pressure to decrease in 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.020
 end of turn to protect the engine or 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.729
 for some function so good that it has to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.709
 new point 40 that you can now 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.840
 make this control by speed of 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.520
 wheel and in this case the wheel speed 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.420
 that is, it is not the wheel of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.039
 traction 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.359
 unless there is no time 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.670
 drag loss and can be made by 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.939
 attraction street but in general it is done by 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.770
 wrong side because when it hits the car 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.499
 it is not in any case that it is appropriate 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.539
 more turbo pressure still this way 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.520
 you can put for example every 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.619
 speed that Iraq has at 0 with 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.329
 next 50 100 per hour 150 200 and 250 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.429
 How many percent of debuchy then? 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.369
 for example if you want at speeds 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.939
 smaller I want only 10% and bush to 100 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.310
 kilometers per hour already and you want 50 to 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.770
 total pressure over 150 kilometers 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.680
 per hour 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.210
 with this it will make a progression of 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.040
 according to what the car can 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.420
 accept and put on the floor 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.580
 this very interesting function because of 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.320
 the circuit because of the street a car 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.080
 track day that really succeeds 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.390
 much more power with more 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.970
 higher speeds 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.270
 if it is a car, for example, 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.550
 best function now is by time and there 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.290
 comes a new option because in fact 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.330
 before they always cause blows 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.680
 practically obligatory 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.640
 use a pulse controller 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.440
 now with this new function it is possible 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.960
 use the function of 500 to 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.440
 several cases of pick-up cars 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.220
 example you have one that does not need 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.530
 co2 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 this is going to be practically the difference 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.660
 because a car that needs co2 or 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.730
 either they force a lot of pressure on the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.100
 next time he will usually need the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.470
 external control but a car like that 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.940
 Suddenly it's the street that will start 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.950
 sometimes a car that really have 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.690
 a concern even with relief from 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.090
 weight not to get rafael 2 not 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.470
 doing nothing in this way can become 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.630
 an interesting function because even 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.720
 simplifies installation are less 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 modules and if everything goes straight then I go 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.380
 give an example here of a car that 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.370
 he would leave like this with up to a second he left 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.350
 with 10% of bush and in five seconds in 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.190
 already put forth 100 percent 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.410
 example 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.260
 and then I can do an interpolation 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.150
 here and do when passing a second 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.110
 after the touch will always have 10% 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.760
 when 25 32 and still 15 seconds goes 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.040
 being with you always felt bush to the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.130
 end has an option also this output 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.840
 be progressive or is it for the car 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.000
 of the circuit for example in general a 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.190
 street car to the detran I gave is very 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.230
 interesting curve output power dosage 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.670
 this is what it means when you have 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.500
 with the pedal between 10 and 90% it goes 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.650
 propose to do a proportion of the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.400
 total value of the opening of the seminar 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.200
 that is, if it is a case of a car 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.470
 the track day for example that you have 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.419
 using speed time it rotates 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.840
 is 100 kilometers per hour that would be 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:26.199
 50% of valve opening and it has 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.570
 with over 90% dtps it really is 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.210
 with 50% however if he is half 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.150
 of the way here dosing it will be lonely 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.039
 with 25 percent instead of 50 here 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.960
 this will cause can decrease 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.580
 turbo pressure not because the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.539
 butterfly rejects in the air that enters 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.520
 district Attorney 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.870
 But why are you relieving and going? 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.479
 make the car much more controllable 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.130
 progressive by foot 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.620
 if it does not matter, you can 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.780
 motivate the boost above such a tell you 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.639
 tps for example and this will also be 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.740
 a function of reducing the price of everything 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.030
 when you take your foot 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.830
 here we are the frequency of 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.180
 sÃ´nia maria of the olive groves in 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.639
 25 reais but now in the new version at 1.49 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.650
 500 people have the option of up to 300 reais 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.590
 by chance of smaller sounds often 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.039
 have the option also leave the 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.020
 0 active again be held at 24:01 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.150
 very cool function that already existed 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.190
 now can be used in conjunction with 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.990
 any of the ways that the button is 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.479
 boost, that is to say, it can be a button on the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.909
 steering wheel for example that of the pilot 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.180
 push a button and will add 20% 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.199
 on the value that is in the table 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.590
 increasing the pressure of the 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.930
 turbo and when it is a pickup car 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.610
 to use the time it has to 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.740
 regulate the pressure to make 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.280
 during the technician then that is regulated 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.860
 for example dropped 14% of the opening 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.320
 my valve for uncle step then 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.270
 in this case will have it will adjust and see 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.340
 how much of this shift's management here 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.030
 he need to put more or less 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.500
 in this case thus opens up new 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.740
 possibilities to use 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.750
 turbo pressure in the 500 itself and not 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.400
 with resources you can do many 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.400
 different things with that
