 mushrooms an essential amino acids 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.809
 there are - should our body 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.460

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.379
 urgently for various body function 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.550

 vegans and vegetarians out there

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.140
 amino acids needs very very good cover 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.680
 n partially these amino acids in meat 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.750
 contain 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.040
 Of course there are also important vitamins in 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.380
 fungus to be included are the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.710
 that also minerals are natural in the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.240
 potassium are reasonably contain the for 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.950
 a regulated water balance in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.110
 our body cares and iron 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.250
 but not only zinc and zinc 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.990

 want to participate in muscle building 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.100
 because sinks you say that is the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.990
 testosterone production in male or female 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.979
 improved in the human body and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.549
 of course that strengthens too 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.149
 immune system and improved wound healing 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.700
 mushrooms are really one 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.930
 Super thing generally mushroom super thing 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.430
 I can only recommend you are 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.799
 very nutritious rich in important 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.689
 vitamins and, of course, also 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.430
 mineral materials and the advantage on 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.780
 this is also the case here 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.579
 You could not consume it raw 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.070
 with every picture at the champignon one can 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.600
 but that is only when he is fresh 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.159
 So few have bought as a two 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.869
 days you can consume him 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.880
 were then only prepared 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.549
 why cook it all the easy way 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.500
 the egg whites in the originals are going down 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.150
 a few days after 345 days 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 Become the poisonous to the human 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.780
 body then you can not die but 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.010
 You do not have to risk anything 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.230
 any stomach upsets or 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 something accordingly the mushroom if you 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.160
 really want to consume him that 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.870
 just fresh otherwise as I said 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.850
 the mushroom is very good at diets 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.700
 Therefore, he has so few calories and he is 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.720
 as I said very, very nutritious and 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.060
 Of course you can also do the lightning in the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.560
 but only if you collect forest 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.670
 idea 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.349
 because you can easily do so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.670
 Assassinate and aid is not too 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.790
 There is no joking language there 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.800
 really poisonous things and you can do that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.150
 champignon with another 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.290
 mix mushroom and this is poisonous 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.050
 So just be careful 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.510
 And if you mushrooms from the forest, yes 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.420
 does not consume too much in the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.580
 weeks because the mushrooms are really so so 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.040
 a small sucker are like sponges 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.019
 they suck all the ingredients in them 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.540
 on and accordingly one may to 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.300
 example Eastern Europe how to get in 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.830
 Eastern Europe does not consume mushrooms because 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.239
 these are still burdened by 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.760
 Chernobyl these are important clues 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.049
 so on the edge but view fungus mushrooms so 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.040
 who can buy in the supermarket 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.709
 Do not worry about it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.080
 they were specially bred 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.060
 greenhouses or jan too 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.940
 Spaces are not greenhouses 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.080
 and picture over thing now I would 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.780
 like to know you since you 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.519
