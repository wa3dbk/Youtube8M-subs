00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.460
 there we are again at watch v beats and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
 today our cooking tips special week 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 I'll show you how to roll a sushi 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.240
 inside out properly rolls because you needed 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.490
 First of all, this wonderful dori leaf 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 you certainly know what you are for her 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.439
 used that has two sides funny 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.349
 Honor a side that is very rough 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.090
 Here recognizes the home and the side 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.199
 is very smooth 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.969
 you always give the attraction to the rough 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.160
 side was there he holds better though 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.600
 Quality test a good logical 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.020
 recognize in it it will pick up 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.059
 so the hands right once the fist 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.379
 Together forest and then so out of hand 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 lets out that it is really small 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.129
 crumbs there is a lesser quality 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.230
 then it recognizes that it stays 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.829
 simply this folie overhears again 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.079
 rises 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.510
 so when you buy new really on 8 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 rather spend more euro because that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 the same does not happen on your palate 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.149
 you have good story melts the go 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.699
 connects with the rice you notice 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 not bad 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.729
 lisa how are gummi what your mouth off 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.740
 therefore always quietly one euro more 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.299
 So spend the job now 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.710
 First of all we have good story 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.939
 since half the rent 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.369
 make the worksheet a bit damp 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.680
 and then pull the rough side up 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.080
 lightly moisten the hands shows that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.119
 you care about it with cold water 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 then the rice does not stick so in the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.240
 Hands will definitely recognize sushi again 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.409
 Cooked rice that he did not finish in 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.970
 The hands stick with cold water 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.320
 that does not happen so much to everyone 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.909
 here now distribute the rich 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.040
 and there is very important that we now 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.400
 do not start pushing like crazy 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.159
 on the journey but very easy 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.290
 stays because he is already too tight presses 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.240
 He really had a big role and he did 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.759
 Think thinks is after two pieces erwin 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.119
 stone then easy then stays 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.670
 the role remains easy to see 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.540
 I did not press hard 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.750
 and yet you can see here 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.219
 there is nothing down so the rice 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.369
 applied now we turn the roll 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.369
 around 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.259
 now her green horseradish comes to her 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.360
 know that taut once such a trace 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.640
 enter into the center 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 You also have to do that because that is 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.580
 the salt in the soup is one without 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.090
 Trying is really a complete one 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.640
 difference 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.560
 that really needs to be achieved right now 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.820
 I just cucumber here in fine 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.650
 cut strips for now 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.270
 lax roll for a piece of salmon 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.030
 the vegetarian subfolder is one 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.840
 long way now comes another avocado 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.660
 the processed followed 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.080
 around it in contrast to turn so 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.320
 then she goes to see the core 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.209
 The best way to do this is with a knife here 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.980
 but hit because the markets are still 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.320
 turn it around 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.940
 Zack because it now explain two thin 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.230
 slices of the avocado comes to me 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.540
 directly from the skin then looks down 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.350
 Also here you can eat here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.840
 pull it off 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.180
 a little tip for you at home with 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 the avocado buys buys yes this 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.209
 The harsh shells have the name of hate 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:21.200
 avocado and those are the best ten 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:25.140
 where you are in the middle from behind 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.269
 high encased the whole now synonymous for 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.030
 Cautiously press it rolls in easily 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.560
 lasso then has the bamboo mat 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.590
 I have now can see well in 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.690
 clear film wrapped when a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.459
 normal sushi roll does where the outside 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.340
 alk is not needed but at this 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.989
 art inside outside which means that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.600
 it must be definitely a rip-off 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.680
 beating it everywhere 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.790
 that he does not give in shape 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.560
 does not train his back 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.040
 just bring in shape 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.910
 that looks good looks like that 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.070
 moisten the knife while cutting 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.880
 cut through the middle 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:15.950
 both help each other and now 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:19.750
 are here again twice next 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.789
 can make new reading about it 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.949
 realized as easy as it can be 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.330
 the pot you boil looks you the 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.889
