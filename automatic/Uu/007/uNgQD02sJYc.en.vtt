taken to black metal in this project is
kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.260> experimental<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.500> lo-fi<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
kind of experimental it's lo-fi there is

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and the song just before the closer is

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.770 
and the song just before the closer is
one<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.070> most<00:04:17.220> aggressive<00:04:17.780> propulsive

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
one of the most aggressive propulsive

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.560 
one of the most aggressive propulsive
hard-hitting<00:04:19.739> songs<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.549> entire<00:04:20.880> LP<00:04:21.329> this

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
hard-hitting songs on the entire LP this

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.839 
hard-hitting songs on the entire LP this
this<00:04:21.989> record<00:04:22.289> really<00:04:22.440> ends<00:04:22.800> off<00:04:23.010> with<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> bang

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
this record really ends off with a bang

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.520 
this record really ends off with a bang
I<00:04:23.880> think<00:04:24.180> compositionally<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.200> record<00:04:25.440> has

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
I think compositionally this record has

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.750 
I think compositionally this record has
quite<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.860> bit

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
quite a bit

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.380 
quite a bit
of<00:04:26.900> variety<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.170> even<00:04:28.920> if<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.550> very<00:04:30.060> rough

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
of variety to it even if the very rough

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.390 
of variety to it even if the very rough
and<00:04:30.540> lo-fi<00:04:30.900> production<00:04:31.500> leaves<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:32.220> lot<00:04:32.370> of

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
and lo-fi production leaves a lot of

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.940 
and lo-fi production leaves a lot of
these<00:04:32.640> songs<00:04:32.880> feeling<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.660> little<00:04:34.140> Sammy<00:04:34.560> Sammy

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
these songs feeling a little Sammy Sammy

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.610 
these songs feeling a little Sammy Sammy
but<00:04:35.220> even<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.580> all<00:04:35.730> these<00:04:35.880> tracks<00:04:36.180> have<00:04:36.420> a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
but even if all these tracks have a

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.220 
but even if all these tracks have a
similarly<00:04:37.620> hazy<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.000> fuzzy<00:04:39.600> feel<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.110> them

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
similarly hazy and fuzzy feel to them

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.750 
similarly hazy and fuzzy feel to them
it's<00:04:40.350> really<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.650> compositions<00:04:41.310> underneath

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
it's really the compositions underneath

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.150 
it's really the compositions underneath
that<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.990> attract<00:04:43.470> me<00:04:43.740> there<00:04:44.010> are

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
that that just attract me there are

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.790 
that that just attract me there are
maybe<00:04:44.370> two<00:04:45.120> or<00:04:45.300> three<00:04:45.330> songs<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:46.350> this<00:04:46.530> thing

where<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.070> feel<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:47.460> maybe<00:04:48.230> melodically

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
where I feel like maybe melodically

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.280 
where I feel like maybe melodically

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
these tracks are a little too basic I

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.470 
these tracks are a little too basic I
wish<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.860> harmonium<00:04:53.490> came<00:04:53.790> in<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.360> did

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
wish that the harmonium came in and did

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.810
