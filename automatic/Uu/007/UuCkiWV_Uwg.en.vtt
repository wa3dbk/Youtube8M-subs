 the dance for the transformation of the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.430
 our clientele we deliver 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.729
 directly from the current faction with itself 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.220
 the courier we are able to maintain 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.690
 very very low prices and to give 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.690
 a really high quality 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 after 25 years of working in the sector 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.280
 some coffee 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.090
 we felt the need to create a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.250
 new product with coffee extract 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.730
 this product is called coffee map 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.100
 is a product made with the extraction of 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.280
 pure coffee comes in the coffee that comes 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.410
 toasted it is ground and then it is done 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.870
 an extraction as if it were a man who 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.850
 coffee juice is extracted 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.630
 cabins 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.270
 is a name that actually gives from carpenedo 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.060
 which is a town in the province of Brescia 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.899
 where it is located practically in ours 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.820
 Coffee hornbeam roasting was 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.119
 designed to create something different 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.759
 so as to satisfy the palates also a 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:11.209
 little demanding we have seen that hearts to 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.140
 coffee was more alcohol than the product 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.690
 let's say so pure coffee has us 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.319
 induced to have to do something 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.890
 different by creating a product based 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.489
 own coffee and with an addition 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.850
 minimum of alcohol in order to keep one 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.890
 conservation without being served without 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.430
 nothing we added 15 degrees of 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.250
 alcohol 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.900
 these 15 other degrees serve only 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.660
 precisely for product conservation 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.360
 Hornbeam coffee is a product that has been 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.269
 created to be consumed after meal is 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.820
 a classic living land having coffee 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.130
 this product has an alcohol content 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.739
 very low can also be consumed 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.660
 during the day because 15 degrees that 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.280
 have been placed are only for the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.959
 product preservation 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.740
 then it's fine as coffee where they leave 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.600
 well 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.030
 mid-morning can go sailing 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.280
 afternoon can be okay there is a little 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.830
 of cold you can go combined m 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.230
 they studied about cakes on ice cream 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.860
 I recommend the coffee creams papers can 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.720
 be drunk cold temperature 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.420
 environment or can be consumed 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.200
 warm heated little the favor with the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.740
 earthworm coffee machine or in a 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.470
 traditional pan on the gas o 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.170
 otherwise for those who have an influx of 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.930
 important people is to say do a 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.090
 pretty fast service we have one 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.460
 machine that keeps the product warm and 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.690
 in a short time he manages to serve 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:51.260
 I do n't even know 100 200 people are okay for 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.240
 who makes parties in catering for those 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.820
 do weddings in ski resorts 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.650
 where the influx of people is consistent 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.770
 we have created some nuances 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.830
 brown label details 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.810
 logically with a coffee bean that 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.400
 he made the drop so as to exalt 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.890
 just what the sciences are from 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.620
 coffee the coffee extract so that who 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.410
 sees the label has already seen the 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.130
 product that there may be in the inter 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.740
 the classic we say so produced a 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.800
 pages of heart a product based on 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.220
 true a coffee coffee hornbeams a product 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.860
 regional without preservatives genuine 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.289
 I recommend everyone to taste it make 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.369
 actually count 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.369
 product we are talking about
