 parents of public school students 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.490
 but parents have realized that their participation in activities 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 schooling is one way of tackling the problem. 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 since March this year 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.260
 the Brazilian adolescent of 14 years 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.570
 has 20% of body burned 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 by a schoolmate 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 everything happened after a discussion in which the two girls the student silmara 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.999
 16 years old 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.680
 threw the contents of a bottle 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.070
 came with gasoline and set fire to the body of graziele clint eastwood 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.490
 you have a son you did not make secrets inside the school itself 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.580
 let's get a CD that does not exist precedent 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580
 the father amuses himself he wants justice done 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.560
 complicated 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 in the case of his son killed in a very difficult confrontation 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 to your dreams 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.730
 the cases of violence have been recurrent in the schools of São Paulo 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.549
 research of the institute fernand braudel 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.930
 points to violence 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.770
 one of the main concerns of the parents of public school students in 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.630
 the city of são paulo, they defend policing in front of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.640
 institutions as a way to curb the problem 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.570
 imagine the following are the children 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 this is a child and you have a 1% risk of some problem like that if it happens 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.480
 surely your perception of your fear 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.040
 It's rather a joke. 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.560
 because the parents have great inner concern, they want me to live the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.910
 schools 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.350

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.890
 violence, thanks to the participation of parents in the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 students routine is very smart 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.870
 interesting to see parents participating 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.870

 reduced to meet your child's school 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.190
 and we have also noticed that these parents every day the parasite has 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.790
 brought new ideas to improve the pedagogical physical space of the school 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.529
 the client always in my team has to do in the school in which they begin to 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.509
 improve the bike that was missing 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.979
 the room was not afraid that the daughter-in-law was too hot 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.279

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.949
 as well as the service is certain that everyone wins 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.819
 but also give a spy the team has that I do not have 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:38.079
 I'm always going to try to be the director of these years, you know my parents have 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.359

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.540
 it is not only out that we hear a lot there are few know 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.719
 that the child is 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.769
 and the little ones approve the constant presence of the parents in the school you like 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.199
 Your mother is always around here. 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.559
 go with a parent awareness for improvements 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:05.079
 in schools and schools before governments is certainly a good 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.970
