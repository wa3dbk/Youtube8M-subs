actually<00:00:21.920> I'm<00:00:22.010> not<00:00:22.100> sure<00:00:22.160> if<00:00:22.460> it's<00:00:22.550> just

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
actually I'm not sure if it's just

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.850

then finding basis like this it's like

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.330 
then finding basis like this it's like
how<00:02:02.840> am<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.049> supposed<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.439> skip<00:02:03.679> this<00:02:03.920> how<00:02:04.159> do<00:02:04.219> I

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.110 
sorry four hundred eighty-six thousand
elixir<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.010> can't<00:02:56.430> skip<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.910> i

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
elixir and it's like I can't skip this i

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.600 
elixir and it's like I can't skip this i
I<00:02:57.450> can't<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.920> would<00:02:59.250> hurt<00:02:59.280> me<00:02:59.580> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I can't it like it would hurt me a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.140 
I can't it like it would hurt me a
tremendously<00:03:00.300> if<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.540> did<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:02.220> think

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
tremendously if I did that so I think

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.540 
tremendously if I did that so I think
the<00:03:03.390> last<00:03:03.570> raid<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.170> actually<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> 920<00:03:05.430> k

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
the last raid was actually like a 920 k

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.900 
the last raid was actually like a 920 k
raid<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.780> one<00:03:06.959> we're<00:03:07.200> looking<00:03:07.290> at<00:03:07.530> about

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
raid and this one we're looking at about

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.550 
raid and this one we're looking at about
five<00:03:08.910> from<00:03:09.150> yeah<00:03:09.450> let's<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.720> say<00:03:09.870> 500,000

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
five from yeah let's just say 500,000

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.460 
five from yeah let's just say 500,000
elixir<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.160> pretty<00:03:11.640> much<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.060> 850<00:03:12.990> k<00:03:13.170> rain

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
elixir so pretty much like an 850 k rain

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.830 
elixir so pretty much like an 850 k rain
so<00:03:14.459> not<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:14.790> much<00:03:14.880> as<00:03:14.940> last<00:03:15.209> one<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:15.630> still<00:03:15.720> a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
so not as much as last one but still a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.420 
so not as much as last one but still a
really<00:03:16.260> good<00:03:16.440> amount<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.800> i<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.010> want<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> go

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
really good amount so i do want to go

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.060 
really good amount so i do want to go
for<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.720> pretty<00:03:18.720> much<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.260> don't<00:03:19.740> even<00:03:19.860> need

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
for this pretty much I don't even need

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.730 
for this pretty much I don't even need

come on like I what am I supposed to say
I<00:03:25.140> put<00:03:25.590> down<00:03:25.709> my<00:03:25.800> balloons<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.340> put<00:03:26.489> down<00:03:26.580> my

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
I put down my balloons I put down my

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.610 
I put down my balloons I put down my
dragons<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:27.989> put<00:03:28.170> down<00:03:28.260> some<00:03:28.440> rage

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
dragons and I just put down some rage

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.810 
dragons and I just put down some rage
spells<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.040> are<00:03:29.160> gonna<00:03:29.250> rip<00:03:29.400> away<00:03:29.550> at<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
spells and are gonna rip away at the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.240 
spells and are gonna rip away at the
base<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.269> that's<00:03:31.260> pretty<00:03:31.470> much<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.920> I

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
base so that's pretty much of that I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.920 
base so that's pretty much of that I
guess<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.730> might<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:32.940> well<00:03:33.239> talk<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.900> guys

last rate I actually managed to find a

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:38.659 
last rate I actually managed to find a
pretty<00:04:37.349> big<00:04:37.559> base<00:04:37.799> and<00:04:38.129> I<00:04:38.189> was<00:04:38.309> really<00:04:38.489> excited

point of this video this these are the
kind<00:04:41.999> of<00:04:42.059> bases<00:04:42.269> that<00:04:42.569> I<00:04:42.629> wanted<00:04:42.899> to<00:04:42.989> find<00:04:43.259> for

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
balloons on the left side so they can

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:01.559 
dumb of me to attack from this side just

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.199 
dumb of me to attack from this side just
because<00:05:01.919> I<00:05:01.949> didn't<00:05:02.369> even<00:05:02.459> notice<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:03.059> the

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:03.209 
because I didn't even notice that the

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:05.179 
because I didn't even notice that the
air<00:05:03.389> sweeper<00:05:03.869> was<00:05:04.169> pointed<00:05:04.649> down<00:05:04.829> this<00:05:04.979> way

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
air sweeper was pointed down this way

air sweeper was pointed down this way
that<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:05.909> something<00:05:06.209> I<00:05:06.479> seem<00:05:07.139> to<00:05:07.289> have<00:05:07.469> trouble

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
with and like noticing i guess just

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.559 
with and like noticing i guess just
because<00:05:11.339> i<00:05:11.519> don't<00:05:11.699> really<00:05:11.789> use<00:05:11.969> air<00:05:12.179> troops<00:05:12.449> i

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:42.809 
writing this base but we'll see how

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.719 
writing this base but we'll see how
things<00:05:43.110> turn<00:05:43.169> out<00:05:43.439> my<00:05:43.949> dragons<00:05:44.399> actually
