00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.200
 I liked the first part as well but easy 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.490
 I go away 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.180
 against the team with which tar against the team m black vanessa trike 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.919
 photo molton counterattack 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.919
 I quickly liked my team 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.949
 it's normal or little 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.980
 no part 1 sheet look 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.140
 keriver ahahah this is the situation that we free have to look for 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.660
 that receiving in the table football is a game I eat as well as under pressure 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 but in the end there was a game in the end 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.020
 the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.760
 I'm really happy 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.130
 for racism they did everything 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.350
 all that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.630
 it was in his 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.120
 his head is happy gorilla 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.220
 Romanist fans who 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.790
 made the trip i 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 they cheered me on 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.500
 I am always happy with society as well 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.440
 ok or for my family 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.410
 I believe it is born 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.620
 it is a desire to win the biggest i that when this arrives me the zoo 80 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.620
 he's afraid to have everything you've done 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.220
 is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.050
 I believe the parameter this time 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.730
 it is very risky 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 sent to then is gone 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.240
 to set the game here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.510
 we have 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.410
 I suffered though 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.790
 a little fear the end is normal this happens 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.400
 still missing 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.350
 lots and lots of things that normal this happens 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 perilli were the result for us and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 a marvel now 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.680
 and we are already thinking of a 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.520
 the atanta that the team that has more 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 points he made at the start of the season 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 it will be a thing will become a thing 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.150
 I am of color this is a team from Real is a team 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:17.229
 that has this desire that we look for in the spring season 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.309
 it's a team that thinks it can 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.309
 do much better still and 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:31.669
 for me it is very important to have this hunger without doing - if but if it does nothing 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.669
 having no penalties in football alone 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.309
 the treasures are lucky and pain this red
