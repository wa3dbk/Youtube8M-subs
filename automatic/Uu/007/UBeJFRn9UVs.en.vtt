00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.709 

after<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.199> run<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.739> preset<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:57.270> really

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
looking that great first of all when I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:09.380

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
don't want a too bright

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.130 
don't want a too bright
I<00:02:17.360> think<00:02:18.360> that's<00:02:18.540> about<00:02:18.690> right<00:02:18.990> there<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
I think that's about right there and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.960 
I think that's about right there and
then<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.650> wanted<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.250> any<00:02:23.430> other<00:02:23.520> brushes

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
then if I wanted to do any other brushes

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.360 
then if I wanted to do any other brushes
like<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.750> wanted<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.200> burn<00:02:25.590> some<00:02:25.950> things<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
like if I wanted to burn some things to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
like if I wanted to burn some things to
make<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.580> darker<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> could<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.570> or<00:02:27.870> I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
make it darker I could do that or I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.550 
make it darker I could do that or I
might<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.450> choose<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> new<00:02:30.780> brush<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
might just choose a new brush just to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.690 
might just choose a new brush just to
sharpen<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.410> like<00:02:34.410> her<00:02:34.650> hair<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
sharpen and like her hair and the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.210 
sharpen and like her hair and the
blanket<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.770> give<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.130> more<00:02:38.370> crisp<00:02:38.790> look<00:02:40.220> all

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
blanket to give it a more crisp look all

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
blanket to give it a more crisp look all
right<00:02:41.430> that's<00:02:41.760> good<00:02:45.380> all<00:02:46.380> right<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.850> can

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
right that's good all right so I can

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.810 
right that's good all right so I can
come<00:02:48.480> back<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.890> when<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.340> create<00:02:50.760> a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
come back to this that when we create a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:03:00.980 
come back to this that when we create a
new<00:02:51.030> snapshot<00:02:51.830> after<00:02:53.270> dodging<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.780> was

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
new snapshot after dodging so this was

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.160 
new snapshot after dodging so this was
before<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:02.040> dodging<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.209> after<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
before the dodging and this is after the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.940 
before the dodging and this is after the
dodging<00:03:05.930> well<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.930> made<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.320> huge

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
dodging well it just made a huge

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.360 
dodging well it just made a huge
difference<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.990> image<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:14.040> really

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
difference to the image and just really

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.900 
difference to the image and just really
popped<00:03:14.640> her<00:03:14.820> face<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.420> made<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.750> more<00:03:15.930> lively

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
popped her face and made it more lively

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.860 
popped her face and made it more lively
all<00:03:17.910> right<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.510> now<00:03:18.870> what<00:03:19.440> I'm<00:03:19.530> gonna<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:20.870> I'm

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
all right so now what I'm gonna do I'm

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.170 
all right so now what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:03:21.959> scroll<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.800> have<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> vignette<00:03:23.580> preset

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
gonna scroll up I have a vignette preset

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.920 
gonna scroll up I have a vignette preset
already<00:03:24.600> made<00:03:24.840> I'm<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.530> gonna<00:03:25.650> click<00:03:26.459> this

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
already made I'm just gonna click this

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.330 
already made I'm just gonna click this
vignette<00:03:27.930> preset<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.920> might<00:03:29.100> be<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
vignette preset and that might be a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.949 
vignette preset and that might be a
little<00:03:29.610> too<00:03:29.820> much<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.600> don't<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
little too much so if you don't have a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.720 
little too much so if you don't have a
vignette<00:03:31.470> preset<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.730> down<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.269> your

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
vignette preset you can go down to your

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.420 
vignette preset you can go down to your
right<00:03:35.730> panel<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.450> go<00:03:36.540> all<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.019> way<00:03:37.050> down<00:03:37.430> to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
right panel and go all the way down to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.540 
right panel and go all the way down to
the<00:03:38.580> effects<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.440> can<00:03:40.680> create<00:03:41.220> your<00:03:41.489> own

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
the effects and you can create your own

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.520 
the effects and you can create your own
the<00:03:42.060> vignette<00:03:42.450> over<00:03:42.750> here<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.140> I'm<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.260> going

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the vignette over here so I'm just going

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.320 
the vignette over here so I'm just going
to<00:03:43.650> kind<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.950> tone<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.610> down<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.820> little<00:03:45.030> bit

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
to kind of tone it down a little bit

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.240 
to kind of tone it down a little bit
maybe<00:03:45.780> feather<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.530> little<00:03:46.800> bit<00:03:46.950> more<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
maybe feather it a little bit more I

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.850 
maybe feather it a little bit more I
think<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.610> looks<00:03:50.790> really<00:03:50.880> good<00:03:51.300> like<00:03:51.360> that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
think that looks really good like that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.350 
think that looks really good like that
and<00:03:52.860> now<00:03:53.760> I'm<00:03:53.850> going<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.090> create<00:03:54.269> another

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and now I'm going to create another

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.589 
and now I'm going to create another
snapshot<00:03:56.900> after

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.780 

so<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.379> can<00:04:02.620> see<00:04:05.340> what<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.459> look<00:04:06.579> like<00:04:06.609> before

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
so you can see what it look like before

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.039 
so you can see what it look like before
the<00:04:07.389> vignette<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.819> after<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:10.150> vignette

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.819 

there<00:04:14.049> we<00:04:14.290> go<00:04:15.389> so<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:16.930> made<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.199> huge

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
there we go so that just made a huge

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.650 
there we go so that just made a huge
difference<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.459> then<00:04:18.609> we<00:04:18.699> can<00:04:18.910> go<00:04:19.060> back<00:04:19.239> to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
difference and then we can go back to

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.170 
difference and then we can go back to
the<00:04:19.989> black<00:04:20.259> and<00:04:20.289> white<00:04:20.650> conversion<00:04:21.130> what<00:04:22.030> it

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
the black and white conversion what it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.180 
the black and white conversion what it
looked<00:04:22.360> like<00:04:22.509> before<00:04:22.690> we<00:04:23.020> added<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.650> brushes

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
looked like before we added the brushes

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.210 
looked like before we added the brushes
and<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.520> vignette<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.270> just<00:04:26.259> a<00:04:26.440> little<00:04:26.889> couple

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
and the vignette so just a little couple

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.189 
and the vignette so just a little couple
of<00:04:27.460> quick<00:04:27.910> things<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.509> can<00:04:28.870> make<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.080> huge

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
of quick things that can make a huge

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.870 
of quick things that can make a huge
impact<00:04:30.070> in<00:04:30.580> your<00:04:30.759> photos<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.639> then<00:04:33.639> I<00:04:33.699> can

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
impact in your photos and then I can

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.370 
impact in your photos and then I can
