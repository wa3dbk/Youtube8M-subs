00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
I'm looking at is there a knife lunge in

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.450 
I'm looking at is there a knife lunge in
black<00:00:06.390> ops<00:00:06.600> 2<00:00:06.779> multiplayer<00:00:07.290> now<00:00:08.040> there<00:00:08.309> are

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
black ops 2 multiplayer now there are

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.250 
black ops 2 multiplayer now there are
four<00:00:08.700> main<00:00:09.000> methods<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.510> knifing<00:00:09.900> we'll<00:00:10.080> get

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
four main methods of knifing we'll get

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.220 
four main methods of knifing we'll get
to<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.790> also<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.389> believe<00:00:12.690> there<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.049> two

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
to that and also I believe there are two

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.990 
to that and also I believe there are two
different<00:00:13.440> ways<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.799> knife<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.670> just

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
different ways to knife you can be just

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.380 
different ways to knife you can be just
stationary<00:00:15.240> like<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.839> panic<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:17.029> sprinting<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
stationary like a panic or sprinting so

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.320 
stationary like a panic or sprinting so
anyways<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> first<00:00:19.500> way<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.070> by<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.699> using<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
anyways the first way is by just using a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.060 
anyways the first way is by just using a
gun<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.779> use<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.080> clicking<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> knife<00:00:22.740> button

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
gun and use in clicking the knife button

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.920 
gun and use in clicking the knife button
that's<00:00:23.340> pretty<00:00:23.640> obvious<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.660> you're

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that's pretty obvious right so you're

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's pretty obvious right so you're
just<00:00:25.080> you're<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.529> moving<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.279> click

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
just you're not moving you just click

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.279 
just you're not moving you just click
the<00:00:26.460> knife<00:00:26.730> button<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.449> very<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:27.990> movement

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the knife button or very little movement

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.710 
the knife button or very little movement
and<00:00:28.769> you're<00:00:29.670> able<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> knife<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.449> way<00:00:30.660> so

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and you're able to knife that way so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600 
and you're able to knife that way so
this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:31.260> I'm<00:00:31.349> testing<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.520> can

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
this is what I'm testing here as you can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
this is what I'm testing here as you can
tell<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> beginning<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.050> no

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
tell at the beginning there was like no

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
tell at the beginning there was like no
lunge<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.309> sprinting<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.270> person

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
lunge and I'm sprinting up this person

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.200 
lunge and I'm sprinting up this person
now<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> suspect<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.160> sprinting<00:00:39.000> has

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
now I suspect that sprinting has

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
now I suspect that sprinting has
something<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.290> gives<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> some<00:00:40.890> kind

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
something to do it gives you some kind

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.190 
something to do it gives you some kind
of<00:00:41.219> lunging<00:00:41.910> ability<00:00:42.329> you'll<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.079> right

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
of lunging ability you'll see right

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.049 
of lunging ability you'll see right
there<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.460> bit<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.820> lunch

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
there that was a little bit of a lunch

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.540 
there that was a little bit of a lunch
it's<00:00:45.329> hard<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> tell<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:47.070> lot<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> these

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's hard to tell and a lot of these

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.569 
it's hard to tell and a lot of these
little<00:00:47.760> tests<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.719> kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.579> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
little tests are gonna be kind of you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
little tests are gonna be kind of you
know<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:51.570> could<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.899> different<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.590> could

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
know they could be different you could

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.319 
know they could be different you could
have<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> massive<00:00:53.460> lunge<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:54.239> not
