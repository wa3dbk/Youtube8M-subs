00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
like I said these are the mustard yellow
colors<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.630> reflective<00:01:10.290> 3m<00:01:10.710> material

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
colors it's got reflective 3m material

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
colors it's got reflective 3m material
in<00:01:11.369> I'll<00:01:11.670> try<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.240> footage<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> that

later<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.530> reflective<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
later it's really reflective so if you
