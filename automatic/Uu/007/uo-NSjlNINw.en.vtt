00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
a huge fan of hidden entrances and

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.540 
a huge fan of hidden entrances and
that's<00:00:13.570> exactly<00:00:13.990> what<00:00:14.680> I've<00:00:14.830> got<00:00:15.070> for<00:00:15.250> you

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:20.169 
today right here so as you can see I'm

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.329 
today right here so as you can see I'm
in<00:00:20.199> my<00:00:20.619> study<00:00:20.980> which<00:00:21.369> looks<00:00:22.800> rather<00:00:23.800> normal

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
in my study which looks rather normal

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.429 
in my study which looks rather normal
but<00:00:25.919> when<00:00:26.919> I<00:00:26.949> I've<00:00:27.820> got<00:00:28.210> this<00:00:28.390> diamond<00:00:28.960> here

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
but when I I've got this diamond here

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.400 
but when I I've got this diamond here
and<00:00:29.650> when<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:29.919> stand<00:00:30.489> on<00:00:30.759> this<00:00:30.999> chair<00:00:31.329> and<00:00:31.749> I

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
and when I stand on this chair and I

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.229 
and when I stand on this chair and I
throw<00:00:32.800> it<00:00:32.860> in<00:00:33.010> front<00:00:33.280> of<00:00:33.400> me<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:33.670> can<00:00:33.820> see<00:00:34.030> this

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
throw it in front of me you can see this

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.869 
throw it in front of me you can see this
pierce<00:00:35.609> and<00:00:36.609> this<00:00:37.149> is<00:00:37.359> what<00:00:37.539> happens<00:00:38.879> there

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
pierce and this is what happens there

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.470 
pierce and this is what happens there
you<00:00:40.000> go<00:00:40.210> so<00:00:40.539> now<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.930> chair<00:00:41.469> has<00:00:41.710> been<00:00:41.890> reset

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you go so now the chair has been reset

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.060 
you go so now the chair has been reset
everything<00:00:43.480> actually<00:00:44.140> has<00:00:44.260> been<00:00:44.440> reset<00:00:44.829> so

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
everything actually has been reset so

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.700 
everything actually has been reset so
you<00:00:45.129> can<00:00:45.370> just<00:00:45.399> use<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.120> again<00:00:46.390> this<00:00:47.109> is<00:00:47.410> what

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
you can just use it again this is what

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.000 
you can just use it again this is what
happens<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:52.870> go<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.469> double<00:00:53.769> piston

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
happens there you go the double piston

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.540 
happens there you go the double piston
extender<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.660> tracts<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.350> pulls<00:00:57.010> out<00:00:57.250> again

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
extender we tracts and pulls out again

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.139 
extender we tracts and pulls out again
chests<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.149> just<00:00:58.929> with<00:00:59.620> enough<00:01:00.100> time<00:01:00.370> between

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
chests in just with enough time between

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.300 
chests in just with enough time between
it<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:02.440> actually<00:01:03.160> fall<00:01:03.399> through<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.980> this<00:01:05.980> is

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
it to actually fall through so this is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.880 
it to actually fall through so this is
the<00:01:06.700> Redstone<00:01:07.180> now<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:07.840> actually<00:01:08.140> quite<00:01:08.530> big

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the Redstone now it's actually quite big

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.399 
the Redstone now it's actually quite big
but<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:12.040> double<00:01:12.670> piston<00:01:12.850> extender<00:01:13.119> isn't<00:01:14.079> now

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
but the double piston extender isn't now

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.260 
but the double piston extender isn't now
it's<00:01:14.680> four<00:01:14.979> by<00:01:15.159> four<00:01:15.430> by<00:01:15.610> four<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.150> that's

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
it's four by four by four so that's

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.710 
it's four by four by four so that's
really<00:01:16.720> compact<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.619> my<00:01:18.009> opinion<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
really compact in my opinion and it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.130 
really compact in my opinion and it
works<00:01:19.990> very<00:01:20.140> smooth<00:01:20.649> let<00:01:21.340> me<00:01:21.460> just<00:01:22.140> delete

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
works very smooth let me just delete

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.550 
works very smooth let me just delete
those<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.689> go<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:28.560> pushing

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
those there you go and the pushing

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.219 
those there you go and the pushing
mechanism<00:01:30.189> is<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> bit<00:01:30.909> weird<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:33.189> it<00:01:33.579> works<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
mechanism is a bit weird but it works so

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.469 
mechanism is a bit weird but it works so
it's<00:01:35.380> really<00:01:35.530> nice<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.159> it's<00:01:36.759> just<00:01:37.119> for<00:01:37.329> my

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
it's really nice and it's just for my

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.929 
it's really nice and it's just for my
foot<00:01:37.719> bad<00:01:37.750> for<00:01:38.200> yeah<00:01:38.979> I'm<00:01:39.250> really<00:01:39.520> happy<00:01:39.670> with

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
foot bad for yeah I'm really happy with

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.889 
foot bad for yeah I'm really happy with
this<00:01:40.090> one<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:41.710> how<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.159> did<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:43.000> one<00:01:43.329> I<00:01:44.259> made<00:01:44.590> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
this one now how I did this one I made a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.929 
this one now how I did this one I made a
there<00:01:46.899> is<00:01:47.140> actually<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:50.250> mine<00:01:51.250> cart<00:01:51.520> with<00:01:51.909> a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
there is actually a mine cart with a

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.719 
there is actually a mine cart with a
hopper<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.840> there<00:01:53.170> which<00:01:53.619> actually<00:01:53.920> picks<00:01:54.520> up

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
hopper in there which actually picks up

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.870 
hopper in there which actually picks up
items<00:01:55.719> if<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.439> if<00:01:56.770> there<00:01:56.979> if<00:01:57.399> there<00:01:57.549> is<00:01:57.789> an

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
items if the if there if there is an

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.529 
items if the if there if there is an
item<00:01:58.289> even<00:01:59.289> one<00:01:59.710> block<00:02:00.009> above<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:00.820> that's

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
item even one block above it so that's

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.550 
item even one block above it so that's
kind<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.710> how<00:02:03.039> it<00:02:03.070> works<00:02:03.430> there<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.560> sorting

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
kind of how it works there is a sorting

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.440 
kind of how it works there is a sorting
system<00:02:05.920> over<00:02:06.219> here<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:06.579> you've<00:02:06.729> got<00:02:06.759> like<00:02:07.090> five

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
system over here so you've got like five

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.259 
system over here so you've got like five
tries<00:02:07.990> for<00:02:08.380> five<00:02:09.009> different<00:02:09.580> items<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.239> then

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
tries for five different items and then

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.339 
tries for five different items and then
it<00:02:10.720> will<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:12.099> won't<00:02:12.400> even<00:02:12.700> let<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.690> diamond

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
it will it won't even let the diamond

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.340 
it will it won't even let the diamond
through

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
through

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
through
and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.210> goes<00:02:17.570> right<00:02:18.530> up<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:19.160> this

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and then it goes right up to this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.850 
and then it goes right up to this
dispenser<00:02:19.880> with<00:02:20.180> which<00:02:20.600> dispenses<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> item

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
dispenser with which dispenses the item

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.430 
dispenser with which dispenses the item
so<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.610> get<00:02:22.790> your<00:02:22.820> item<00:02:23.330> back<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.200> case

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
so you get your item back in this case

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.510 
so you get your item back in this case
the<00:02:24.650> diamond<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.480> I've<00:02:26.480> got<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.930> zoom<00:02:26.990> voids

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
the diamond and I've got a zoom voids

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.720 
the diamond and I've got a zoom voids
pulse<00:02:28.520> extender<00:02:29.060> over<00:02:29.480> here<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.310> then<00:02:31.310> that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
pulse extender over here and then that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.380 
pulse extender over here and then that
leads<00:02:32.600> all<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.990> way<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.890> 4<00:02:34.460> by<00:02:34.640> 4<00:02:35.060> piston

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
leads all the way to this 4 by 4 piston

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.520 
leads all the way to this 4 by 4 piston
extender<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.800> design<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.690> yeah<00:02:39.140> let's

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
extender so this design so yeah let's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.340 
extender so this design so yeah let's
build<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:41.090> right<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:41.780> we're<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:42.140> to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
build it all right so we're going to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.830 
build it all right so we're going to
start<00:02:42.650> off<00:02:42.830> by<00:02:42.890> placing<00:02:43.520> our<00:02:43.820> sticky<00:02:44.300> pistons

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
start off by placing our sticky pistons

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.950 
start off by placing our sticky pistons
so<00:02:45.560> we're<00:02:45.800> going<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.100> build<00:02:46.270> three<00:02:47.270> pistons<00:02:47.750> up

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
so we're going to build three pistons up

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.470 
so we're going to build three pistons up
like<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.500> sticky<00:02:49.010> pistons<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.730> two<00:02:50.210> sticky

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
like this sticky pistons and two sticky

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.290 
like this sticky pistons and two sticky
pistons<00:02:50.990> like<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.180> going

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
pistons like this and then we're going

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.320 
pistons like this and then we're going
to<00:02:53.480> place<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.020> block<00:02:54.740> of<00:02:54.890> iron<00:02:55.160> or<00:02:55.490> whatever

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
to place the block of iron or whatever

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.890 
to place the block of iron or whatever
your<00:02:56.570> floor<00:02:56.900> block<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.440> right<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.900> just

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
your floor block is right there just

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.960 
your floor block is right there just
keep<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.260> mind<00:03:00.530> though<00:03:00.710> that<00:03:00.740> this<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
keep in mind though that this is the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.780 
keep in mind though that this is the
block<00:03:02.210> that<00:03:02.450> will<00:03:02.630> be<00:03:02.780> filled<00:03:03.110> up<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:04.760> one<00:03:05.350> so

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
block that will be filled up this one so

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.540 
block that will be filled up this one so
yeah<00:03:07.790> when<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.530> kind<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.740> figure<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.310> out

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
yeah when you kind of figure this out

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.510 
yeah when you kind of figure this out
we're<00:03:10.910> going<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.240> continue<00:03:12.160> with<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.340> red

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
we're going to continue with the red

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.460 
we're going to continue with the red
circuit<00:03:14.000> you're<00:03:14.570> going<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.780> place<00:03:14.960> two<00:03:15.320> blocks

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
circuit you're going to place two blocks

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.660 
circuit you're going to place two blocks
like<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:16.660> block<00:03:17.660> right<00:03:18.050> there<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.770> cord

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
like this a block right there a cord

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.080 
like this a block right there a cord
slap<00:03:20.060> or<00:03:20.360> what<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.930> slap<00:03:21.230> right<00:03:22.190> there<00:03:22.460> and<00:03:22.700> a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
slap or what a slap right there and a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.180 
slap or what a slap right there and a
block<00:03:23.390> right<00:03:23.600> there<00:03:23.630> now<00:03:24.080> this<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.590> important

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
block right there now this is important

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.220 
block right there now this is important
because<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.820> our<00:03:25.940> input<00:03:26.240> make<00:03:26.990> sure<00:03:27.170> i'm

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
because this is our input make sure i'm

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.010 
because this is our input make sure i'm
going<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.560> put<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:28.310> lever<00:03:28.550> on<00:03:28.850> top<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.840> this

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
going to put the lever on top of this

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.890 
going to put the lever on top of this
we're<00:03:30.800> going<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.980> place<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.640> redstone<00:03:32.390> right

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
we're going to place a redstone right

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
we're going to place a redstone right
there<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.800> repeater<00:03:34.250> right<00:03:34.610> there<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.030> if

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
there and a repeater right there so if

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.080 
there and a repeater right there so if
you<00:03:35.270> power<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.710> top<00:03:37.010> two<00:03:37.310> pistons<00:03:37.880> will

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
you power this the top two pistons will

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.640 
you power this the top two pistons will
push<00:03:38.960> out<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.560> retract<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:41.180> right<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.410> what

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
push out and retract all right and what

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.200 
push out and retract all right and what
we're<00:03:42.830> going<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.130> do<00:03:43.280> then<00:03:43.490> is<00:03:43.670> we're<00:03:43.910> going<00:03:44.090> to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
we're going to do then is we're going to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.620 
we're going to do then is we're going to
continue<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.380> circuit<00:03:46.480> actually<00:03:47.480> we're

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
continue this circuit actually we're

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.730 
continue this circuit actually we're
going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.930> place<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.170> block<00:03:48.440> right<00:03:48.710> there

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
going to place a block right there

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.020 
going to place a block right there
because<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.460> be<00:03:52.580> powered

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
because this is a this can be powered

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.540 
because this is a this can be powered
this<00:03:53.780> restaurant<00:03:54.410> can<00:03:54.680> be<00:03:54.800> powered<00:03:55.040> by<00:03:55.250> this

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
this restaurant can be powered by this

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.940 
this restaurant can be powered by this
rents<00:03:55.910> down<00:03:56.090> list<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:57.500> right<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:57.860> we're

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
rents down list all right then we're

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.440 
rents down list all right then we're
going<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.250> place<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.460> repeater<00:03:58.700> right<00:03:59.240> there

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
going to place a repeater right there

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.500 
going to place a repeater right there
sitting<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.960> fol<00:04:00.410> delay<00:04:00.740> a<00:04:01.010> block<00:04:01.790> right<00:04:02.480> there

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
sitting on fol delay a block right there

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.900 
sitting on fol delay a block right there
and<00:04:03.230> there<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.860> then<00:04:04.250> we're<00:04:04.490> going<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.700> place

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
and there and then we're going to place

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.930 
and there and then we're going to place
another<00:04:05.150> repeater<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.990> full<00:04:06.380> delay<00:04:06.620> again<00:04:06.940> so

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
another repeater on full delay again so

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.800 
another repeater on full delay again so
this<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.210> how<00:04:08.840> your<00:04:09.350> system<00:04:10.190> will<00:04:10.250> look<00:04:10.810> then

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
this is how your system will look then

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.420 
this is how your system will look then
I'm<00:04:11.930> going<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.200> continue<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.160> green

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
I'm going to continue on the green

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.770 
I'm going to continue on the green
circuit<00:04:13.880> we're<00:04:14.000> going<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.180> place<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.600> two

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
circuit we're going to place the two

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.900 
circuit we're going to place the two
blue<00:04:15.020> block<00:04:15.560> one<00:04:15.860> block<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:16.580> a

is there you go now all your three

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.800 
is there you go now all your three
pistons<00:04:32.840> are<00:04:33.050> extended<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.699> will<00:04:35.060> retract<00:04:35.479> as

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
pistons are extended and will retract as

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.760 
pistons are extended and will retract as
well<00:04:37.150> alright<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.509> on<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.289> next<00:04:39.470> part

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
well alright so on to the next part

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.040

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
repeater on three tix right there that

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.620 
repeater on three tix right there that
will<00:04:48.410> power<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:48.979> bottom<00:04:49.310> paste<00:04:49.520> them<00:04:49.759> then

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
will power this bottom paste them then

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.570 
will power this bottom paste them then
we're<00:04:50.900> going<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.229> place<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.710> dropper<00:04:52.160> next<00:04:52.490> to

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
we're going to place a dropper next to

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.790 
we're going to place a dropper next to
this<00:04:52.759> torch<00:04:53.120> facing<00:04:53.930> up<00:04:54.139> with<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.500> hopper

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.670 
this torch facing up with a hopper
facing<00:04:55.250> down<00:04:55.520> right<00:04:55.820> into<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.530> dropper<00:04:57.530> and

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
facing down right into the dropper and

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.590 
facing down right into the dropper and
you're<00:04:58.070> going<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.250> place<00:04:58.400> random<00:04:58.880> item<00:04:59.240> in<00:04:59.449> the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
you're going to place random item in the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.589 
you're going to place random item in the
dropper<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.910> then<00:05:01.910> you're<00:05:02.120> going<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.360> place

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
dropper and then you're going to place

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.050 
dropper and then you're going to place
two<00:05:02.810> blocks<00:05:02.990> like<00:05:03.349> this<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.889> a<00:05:04.310> comparator

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
two blocks like this and a comparator

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.779 
two blocks like this and a comparator
running<00:05:05.300> out<00:05:05.449> of<00:05:05.509> this<00:05:05.840> hopper<00:05:06.349> and<00:05:06.639> that<00:05:07.639> will

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
running out of this hopper and that will

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.779 
running out of this hopper and that will
power<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.270> piston<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.039> then<00:05:10.039> for<00:05:10.280> lasting

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
power this piston and then for lasting

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.820 
power this piston and then for lasting
you're<00:05:11.030> going<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.240> place<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.630> slab<00:05:12.259> right<00:05:12.560> there

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
you're going to place a slab right there

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.360 
you're going to place a slab right there
a<00:05:13.070> repeater<00:05:13.970> right<00:05:14.570> there<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.470> block<00:05:15.949> right

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
a repeater right there and a block right

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.480 
a repeater right there and a block right
there<00:05:16.690> now<00:05:17.690> if<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.050> flick<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.500> switch<00:05:18.949> which

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
there now if you flick the switch which

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.900 
there now if you flick the switch which
is<00:05:19.699> right<00:05:19.940> here<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:21.620> can<00:05:21.800> see<00:05:22.130> that<00:05:22.759> it

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
is right here you can see that it

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.230 
is right here you can see that it
extends<00:05:23.539> two<00:05:23.930> blocks<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.430> is<00:05:25.759> all<00:05:25.940> your

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
extends two blocks so that is all your

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.480 
extends two blocks so that is all your
redstone<00:05:26.660> done<00:05:27.050> alright<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.889> last<00:05:27.919> thing<00:05:28.370> I

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
redstone done alright the last thing I

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.219 
redstone done alright the last thing I
want<00:05:28.759> to<00:05:28.820> tell<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.210> guys<00:05:29.240> about<00:05:29.690> this<00:05:30.020> system

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
want to tell you guys about this system

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.620 
want to tell you guys about this system
is<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:30.680> all<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.729> rest<00:05:31.940> on<00:05:32.180> can<00:05:32.360> be<00:05:32.449> made

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
is that all the rest on can be made

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.529 
is that all the rest on can be made
invisible<00:05:33.250> just<00:05:34.250> by<00:05:34.400> replacing<00:05:34.580> some<00:05:35.300> blocks

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
invisible just by replacing some blocks

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.770 
invisible just by replacing some blocks
over<00:05:35.750> here<00:05:36.169> and<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.590> can<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:38.210> your<00:05:38.240> chef

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
over here and you can have your chef

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.960 
over here and you can have your chef
just<00:05:39.110> like<00:05:39.260> this<00:05:39.440> just<00:05:39.740> for<00:05:40.639> those<00:05:40.699> two

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
just like this just for those two

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
just like this just for those two
pistons<00:05:41.419> they<00:05:41.630> will<00:05:41.870> be<00:05:42.520> visible<00:05:43.990> otherwise

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
pistons they will be visible otherwise

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.010 
pistons they will be visible otherwise
you<00:05:45.260> should<00:05:45.289> have<00:05:45.830> a<00:05:46.190> way<00:05:46.880> mark<00:05:47.180> van<00:05:47.449> system

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
you should have a way mark van system

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.200 
you should have a way mark van system
and<00:05:48.260> it<00:05:48.380> probably<00:05:48.740> will<00:05:49.340> take<00:05:49.729> much<00:05:50.180> more

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
and it probably will take much more

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.339 
and it probably will take much more
space<00:05:50.810> than<00:05:51.139> this<00:05:51.470> system<00:05:52.039> does<00:05:52.750> also<00:05:53.750> what<00:05:54.320> is

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
space than this system does also what is

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.310 
space than this system does also what is
very<00:05:54.680> nice<00:05:54.889> is<00:05:55.340> that<00:05:55.610> you've<00:05:56.570> got<00:05:56.780> your<00:05:56.810> floor

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
very nice is that you've got your floor

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.580 
very nice is that you've got your floor
right<00:05:57.560> here<00:05:57.590> so<00:05:58.400> you<00:05:58.490> can<00:05:58.849> place<00:05:59.120> a<00:05:59.590> bookshelf

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
right here so you can place a bookshelf

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.180 
right here so you can place a bookshelf
or<00:06:00.889> a<00:06:00.949> crafting<00:06:01.610> table<00:06:01.639> right<00:06:02.150> there<00:06:02.389> so<00:06:03.190> just

like this people won't notice that there
might<00:06:07.789> be<00:06:07.849> something<00:06:08.409> underneath<00:06:09.409> this<00:06:09.770> so

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
might be something underneath this so
