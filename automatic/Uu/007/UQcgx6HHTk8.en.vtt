oh no no no there's six other people in
New<00:05:08.650> Zealand<00:05:08.680> building<00:05:09.220> these<00:05:09.310> at<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.520> moment

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
New Zealand building these at the moment

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.250 
New Zealand building these at the moment
as<00:05:09.850> well<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.150> it's<00:05:10.240> only<00:05:10.389> growing<00:05:10.540> is<00:05:10.870> awesome

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
as well and it's only growing is awesome

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.870 
as well and it's only growing is awesome
it's<00:05:12.010> really<00:05:12.250> starting<00:05:12.370> to<00:05:12.550> take<00:05:12.610> off

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
it's really starting to take off

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.490 
it's really starting to take off
especially<00:05:13.240> with<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.389> price<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.600> guess<00:05:13.840> it

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
especially with the price I guess it

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.740 
especially with the price I guess it
cost<00:05:14.770> Gavin<00:05:15.130> about<00:05:15.340> two<00:05:15.639> dollars<00:05:15.850> a<00:05:16.090> time<00:05:16.419> to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
cost Gavin about two dollars a time to

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.500 
cost Gavin about two dollars a time to
charge<00:05:17.050> his<00:05:17.260> car<00:05:17.530> for<00:05:18.010> each<00:05:18.160> 60k<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:19.000> Motoring

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
charge his car for each 60k of Motoring

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.570 
charge his car for each 60k of Motoring
and<00:05:19.840> he<00:05:20.229> plans<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.710> build<00:05:20.919> his<00:05:21.160> own<00:05:21.280> wind

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
and he plans to build his own wind

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.090 
and he plans to build his own wind
generator<00:05:22.090> or<00:05:22.300> solar<00:05:22.600> unit<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:23.650> it'll<00:05:23.889> cost

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
generator or solar unit so it'll cost

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.450 
generator or solar unit so it'll cost
him<00:05:24.300> exactly<00:05:25.300> nothing<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.650> possibly<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.250> time

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
him exactly nothing so possibly the time
