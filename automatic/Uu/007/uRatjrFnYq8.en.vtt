really<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:02.360> think

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.050 

most<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> technology<00:01:09.100> we<00:01:09.250> suspended<00:01:09.909> in

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
most of the technology we suspended in

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060 
most of the technology we suspended in
today<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:10.600> complex<00:01:11.049> it's<00:01:11.320> abstract<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.950> us

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
today is so complex it's abstract to us

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.130 
today is so complex it's abstract to us
and<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.000> affects<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.420> way<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.570> see<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.960> world

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
and it affects the way we see the world

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.190 
and it affects the way we see the world
and<00:01:14.470> how<00:01:14.500> we<00:01:15.130> think<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:16.570> problematic

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.899 

it's<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.350> dangerous<00:01:20.740> short<00:01:21.009> circuit<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.549> human
