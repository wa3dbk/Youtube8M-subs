ok<00:00:02.590> the<00:00:02.770> next<00:00:02.800> series<00:00:03.429> of<00:00:03.639> examples<00:00:04.680> are<00:00:05.680> what

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:05.920 
ok the next series of examples are what

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.700 
ok the next series of examples are what
I<00:00:05.950> call<00:00:06.250> zigzag<00:00:06.910> rolling<00:00:07.360> shifts<00:00:07.840> okay<00:00:08.440> and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
I call zigzag rolling shifts okay and

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.740 
I call zigzag rolling shifts okay and
basically<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:11.400> designed<00:00:12.400> to<00:00:12.519> help<00:00:12.700> you<00:00:12.850> see

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
basically it's designed to help you see

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.840 
basically it's designed to help you see
the<00:00:14.130> two<00:00:15.130> scale<00:00:16.119> patterns<00:00:17.490> side-by-side<00:00:18.490> the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
the two scale patterns side-by-side the

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.580 
the two scale patterns side-by-side the
three<00:00:19.360> note<00:00:19.480> per<00:00:19.630> string<00:00:19.660> scale<00:00:20.170> patterns

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
three note per string scale patterns

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.370 
three note per string scale patterns
we're<00:00:21.460> going<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.610> be<00:00:21.730> doing<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:23.199> going<00:00:23.320> to

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
we're going to be doing we're going to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.260 
we're going to be doing we're going to
be<00:00:23.470> using<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.949> legato<00:00:24.310> technique<00:00:25.150> here

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
be using the legato technique here

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.790 
be using the legato technique here
basically<00:00:28.270> it's<00:00:29.050> going<00:00:29.199> to<00:00:29.260> be<00:00:29.410> something

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
basically it's going to be something

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.799 
basically it's going to be something
like<00:00:35.339> okay<00:00:36.339> and<00:00:36.999> I'm<00:00:37.089> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.269> play<00:00:37.420> it<00:00:37.569> slow

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
like okay and I'm going to play it slow

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.989 
like okay and I'm going to play it slow
don't<00:00:37.989> worry<00:00:38.519> so<00:00:40.139> the<00:00:41.139> concept<00:00:41.679> is<00:00:41.949> that<00:00:42.789> after

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
don't worry so the concept is that after

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.860 
don't worry so the concept is that after
you<00:00:43.359> have<00:00:43.539> a<00:00:43.569> role<00:00:43.989> okay<00:00:45.539> you're<00:00:46.539> going<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.749> go

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
you have a role okay you're going to go

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.520 
you have a role okay you're going to go
to<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:47.079> next<00:00:47.260> string<00:00:48.839> after<00:00:49.839> you<00:00:50.109> have<00:00:50.289> this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
to the next string after you have this

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.639 
to the next string after you have this
descending<00:00:51.309> phrase<00:00:52.139> you're<00:00:53.139> going<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.350> shift

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
descending phrase you're going to shift

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.489 
descending phrase you're going to shift
either<00:00:54.399> up<00:00:54.819> or<00:00:54.969> down<00:00:55.030> depending<00:00:55.269> on<00:00:56.079> what<00:00:56.319> your

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
either up or down depending on what your

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.549 
either up or down depending on what your
last<00:00:56.769> ship<00:00:57.459> was<00:00:57.789> because<00:00:58.479> as<00:00:58.659> you<00:00:58.809> can<00:00:58.839> see<00:00:58.989> i'm

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
last ship was because as you can see i'm

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.789 
last ship was because as you can see i'm
shifting<00:01:00.190> back<00:01:00.729> and<00:01:00.760> forth<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:02.469> scale

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
shifting back and forth from scale

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.670 
shifting back and forth from scale
pattern<00:01:03.159> to<00:01:03.249> scale<00:01:03.519> pattern<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.540> uh<00:01:04.930> not

more okay now ascending the Rope the
rules<00:01:44.439> are<00:01:44.799> somewhat<00:01:45.430> reversed<00:01:46.140> after<00:01:47.140> you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
rules are somewhat reversed after you

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.990

have a ascending melodic phrase you're
going<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.210> go<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.509> next<00:01:52.689> string<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.820> then

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
going to go to the next string and then

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.609 
going to go to the next string and then
when<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.329> have<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.539> role<00:01:55.960> you're<00:01:56.409> going<00:01:56.560> to

shift up or down depending on what your
last<00:01:59.649> shift<00:02:00.220> was<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.479> for<00:02:02.409> instance<00:02:02.500> when<00:02:02.979> we

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
last shift was so for instance when we

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
last shift was so for instance when we
go<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:04.689> have<00:02:05.380> our<00:02:05.530> ascending<00:02:06.159> melodic<00:02:06.670> phrase

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
go we have our ascending melodic phrase

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.270 
go we have our ascending melodic phrase
go<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.380> next<00:02:08.530> string<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:11.980> we're

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
go to the next string and then we're

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.949 
go to the next string and then we're
going<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.549> shift<00:02:12.849> up<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.910> have<00:02:16.060> an<00:02:16.209> ascending

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
going to shift up we have an ascending

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.690 
going to shift up we have an ascending
melodic<00:02:17.410> phrase<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.160> we're<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.489> go<00:02:18.519> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
melodic phrase so we're going to go to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.979 
melodic phrase so we're going to go to
the<00:02:18.730> next<00:02:18.970> string<00:02:21.599> okay<00:02:22.599> we're<00:02:22.780> going<00:02:22.900> to

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
the next string okay we're going to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.650 
the next string okay we're going to
shift<00:02:23.140> down<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.769> time<00:02:24.090> because<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.390> last

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
shift down this time because my last

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.509 
shift down this time because my last
shift<00:02:25.989> wasn't<00:02:26.440> up<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.920> time<00:02:27.190> we're<00:02:27.340> going<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
shift wasn't up this time we're going to

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.720 
shift wasn't up this time we're going to
shift<00:02:27.670> down<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:29.049> we<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.410> our<00:02:30.390> sending<00:02:31.390> phrase

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
shift down so we have our sending phrase

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:42.870 
shift down so we have our sending phrase
the<00:02:33.730> next<00:02:34.000> string<00:02:35.700> shift<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:38.760> extreme

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.760

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
sitting quantic phrase for the next

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:56.809 
sitting quantic phrase for the next
string
