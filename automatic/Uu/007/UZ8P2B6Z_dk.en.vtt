within<00:00:47.899> 20<00:00:48.199> minutes<00:00:48.319> your<00:00:48.589> blood<00:00:48.649> sugar

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
within 20 minutes your blood sugar

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.340 
within 20 minutes your blood sugar
spikes<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:49.549> your<00:00:49.639> liver<00:00:49.819> responds<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.199> the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
spikes and your liver responds so the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.779 
spikes and your liver responds so the
minute<00:00:51.589> we<00:00:51.679> kick<00:00:51.889> that<00:00:52.069> liver<00:00:52.280> into<00:00:52.609> motion

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
minute we kick that liver into motion

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.959 
minute we kick that liver into motion
then<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.959> bursts<00:00:54.920> insulin<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:55.729> can<00:00:55.879> you

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
then it bursts insulin so can you

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.529 
then it bursts insulin so can you
imagine<00:00:56.209> if<00:00:56.629> you<00:00:56.780> are<00:00:56.920> syndrome<00:00:57.920> X

hypoglycemic or diabetic what it's going

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.819 
hypoglycemic or diabetic what it's going
to<00:01:00.530> do<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:02.449> livers<00:01:02.989> screaming<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.589> its

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
to do to you the livers screaming is its

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.530 
to do to you the livers screaming is its
first<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.280> with<00:01:04.430> insulin<00:01:04.730> coming<00:01:05.059> out<00:01:05.180> then

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
first in with insulin coming out then

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.270 
first in with insulin coming out then
within<00:01:05.690> 40<00:01:06.140> minutes<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.890> caffeine

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
within 40 minutes the caffeine

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.460 
within 40 minutes the caffeine
absorption<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:07.880> totally<00:01:08.210> complete<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.870> so

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
absorption is totally complete and so

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.920 
absorption is totally complete and so
your<00:01:09.620> pupils<00:01:10.010> are<00:01:10.100> dilated<00:01:10.730> the<00:01:10.850> same<00:01:11.360> way<00:01:11.630> as

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
your pupils are dilated the same way as

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.470 
your pupils are dilated the same way as
if<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.710> had<00:01:13.100> taken<00:01:13.850> some<00:01:14.120> kind<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.360> an

if you had taken some kind of an
amphetamine<00:01:15.020> your<00:01:15.800> blood<00:01:15.980> pressure<00:01:16.190> rises

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
amphetamine your blood pressure rises

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.520 
amphetamine your blood pressure rises
your<00:01:16.880> pupils<00:01:17.210> are<00:01:17.330> dilated<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.350> liver

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
your pupils are dilated and your liver

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.290 
your pupils are dilated and your liver
dumps<00:01:18.830> more<00:01:19.100> sugar<00:01:19.490> into<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.730> bloodstream<00:01:19.970> to

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
dumps more sugar into the bloodstream to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.400 
dumps more sugar into the bloodstream to
try<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.510> overcome<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.370> okay<00:01:22.400> then<00:01:23.090> within<00:01:23.410> 45

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
try to overcome that okay then within 45

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.050 
try to overcome that okay then within 45
minutes<00:01:24.440> your<00:01:24.890> body<00:01:25.010> increases<00:01:25.730> dopamine

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
production and the dopamine production

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.240 
production and the dopamine production
stimulates<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.690> pleasure<00:01:30.410> centers<00:01:30.980> of<00:01:31.010> your
