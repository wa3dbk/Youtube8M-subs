00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends with you dan drank ws 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.470
 if you knew how I got lazy and not 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.590
 added a long time ago video and how i play 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.710
 now and how not to keep statistics 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 a tear that you would have for a long time and spat 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.880
 would put on like and unsubscribe from 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.300
 my channel because i really 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.150
 come from somewhere out there with heavy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.910
 activities of your labor and lie down on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 sofa I put a laptop on my stomach to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 I've never done this before 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.809
 start playing tanks like that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.809
 It has become statist is not accordingly 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.770
 statistics falls hands curves are obtained 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.870
 and everything is all going wrong somehow 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.239
 and so they say, and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
 it is against this and more nerves when you 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 losing well how so how so 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 killed extras 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 who lies on the couch is scratching his belly 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.460
 pancake with one hand and the other playing tanks 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.789
 Well, now the essence is not about that, but we 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 let's talk a little more abasi second 3 3 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.010
 video is my second bose I already 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.360
 added with nines there fights with 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.729
 sevens now added again with 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.240
 sevens where in the top here is the food on the tundra 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.939
 on the right flank now where mostly and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.090
 screed from pawns with a break of 175 is quite 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.689
 enough if anyone knows what of 2 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.150
 so this is what they gave us on May 9 in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.950
 action game on stock in the store up 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 Wargaming sold here and this tank 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.430
 it looks like from a normal branch issued from 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.500
 the first is usually but slightly different in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 the characteristics are at 50 percent here 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.210
 it would seem more straightforward to be worse 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.360
 yes streaming tank but it was not there 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.670
 this tank is better but yes reduced here 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.920
 engine capacity is 100 then here is 600 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.910
 against 700 and here speed is faster 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 highway rotation 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.390
 that is, but because 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.430
 compensated by the passage of the soil these 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.310
 600 horses they also absolutely 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.619
 pull the tank out as usual and here 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.570
 talked about statistics and in principle 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.550
 nothing special is moving in 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.160
 two now and it shoots now 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.790
 speech all from co2 tactics shot 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.530
 and it is already necessary to take there all these 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.330
 small tanks which in principle 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 no threat to me anymore 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.989
 It represents 1700 damage and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.900
 imagine what a difference yes straight 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.760
 it is straight tank he delivers more 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.370
 a lot of pleasure when it brings more 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.630
 silver and plus when he gets to the top he 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.030
 really seven on 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.700
 really surpasses the other tanks there 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.620
 sisters and the same especially peter even 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.770
 when throws to the same eight and with 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.110
 sixth let's say this tank then he 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.239
 feels comfortable enough 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.840
 because he has an identical gun which 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.750
 from a 6 with the same spread of information from 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.239
 same with the same breakthrough that is 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.840
 You can easily punch gold out of six 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.260
 with 217 penetration 175 can also be targeted 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.810
 us any hatches hooks here and 2 100 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.819
 damage and average damage and so I said 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.549
 I'm on my paunch 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.950
 lie down and play about yes laptop on 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.109
 bubble and play tank in tank and 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.469
 Respectively, the statistics scorches but 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.230
 I have a rule on certain tanks 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:30.969
 no play with a laptop on 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.969
 and this one enters this rule from 2 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:36.340
 why in all because I raise 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:41.799
 it statistics that is to meet him 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.879
 home stones 1750 which is almost equal 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.480
 there is an average damage to the top players and I 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.169
 in no case will I be on this tank 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:59.560
 play when there is inadequate 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:00.250
 or is there tired or there I lie on the couch with 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.040
 a laptop 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.449
 that's why I fight accordingly 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.000
 added just because I was sitting and 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:13.719
 clearly trying to get to the result here 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.419
 Now I grab the base and apt-85 there we are 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.549
 see what feeds becomes lithium 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.110
 aiming yes sort of tank panther 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.090
 he heals but doesn't hit 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.639
 like the panther there is no panther shorter 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.330
 I started talking about capturing 8:11 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.520
 and i need homework 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.139
 raising on this tank all the same therefore 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.389
 i'm so here for the little knights here 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.729
 gently roll back or roll away 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.289
 same that t-34 11 times it means that i have 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.099
 recharge injected can be squeezed out 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.690
 Guslyu excellent pick up the score 9:11 and me 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.639
 I don't want to grab the base at all 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.680
 why because i'm raising stats 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.610
 again if biolage is on the couch with 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.719
 laptop on the belly with a salty sweater 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.789
 then yes, but here damage is important to me 18 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:04.120
 seconds left the capture remains this 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.340
 It means that we must leave Kursk 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.380
 21 for grabs let him shoot down capture them 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.240
 how they want it but it doesnâ€™t really 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.639
 trying to seize this base too 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.469
 because it climbs its cardboard tower 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.199
 and see what lights up here 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.330
 light bulb it means that su 122 44 already on 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.710
 that side sees me here and and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.500
 control means she's not going anywhere 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.140
 and so let's click on the base and how you 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.370
 think here now from 2 see on the right 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.730
 flank here out of 2 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.230
 that is, he does not go around to where 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.850
 first line means he will go in principle 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.310
 through this little town 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.340
 so I can meet his principle but 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.280
 in front of the bridge there control tiger 1 and and 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.500
 su 122 44 if the capture of our base did not go 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.600
 it means they are coming here to shoot down to capture and 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.040
 i see here and from the second and what i do 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.070
 I turn the place to 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.140
 shoot back immediately go back rather 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.800
 no shoot right turn the gun and 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.930
 finish 124 shot I shoot test minutes 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.890
 for ISU second and immediately what do you think 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.440
 go to 122 44 good she is not me 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.300
 punches but punches tiger 1 i don't 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.490
 managed to naturally recharge and already 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.950
 they are not going anywhere is that we know that 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.220
 i recharged odd respectively 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.060
 and I lost my glasses again lost strength 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.940
 two hundred fifty six strength points and 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:27.080
 Only thanks to this error when I 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:31.370
 you did not get much and left 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.910
 on the bridge but got myself here and left with 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.830
 bases 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.580
 naturally the team is tense 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:43.220
 naturally they are now you are aiming for 85 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.810
 finally and accordingly we can 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.310
 here notice what should now 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:51.110
 climb and in theory because the capture is 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.200
 must lead here two against 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.690
 three I'm on two blows from the second he 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.970
 trying to target me here but not 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.190
 he shoots and I have on one hit 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.980
 means tiger second finish off whom 2 and 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.620
 su 122 44 to make such a mistake he could 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.870
 already see me out of 2 I now forget about 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.610
 of 2 and he 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.150
 come back finish me already whom 2 would be there 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:15.700
 finished off somehow together already but he 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.660
 make a mistake and he pull out no 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:23.170
 save the battle and now I see here that 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:26.530
 stays here out of 2 which is easy and 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:29.050
 in principle, you can freely 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.180
 It was necessary to seize the base Mages 2000 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.930
 there were still nineteen hundred knockin so 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.840
 fight try guys i just really 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:40.380
 I want to add good fights but somehow 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.630
 I can't do it all the time I'm tired and 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.710
 the horse starts not to watch its 

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.570
 become statistics 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:51.360
 Thank you all who liked to put 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.360
 likes and see you soon bye bye
