has<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.030> do<00:00:38.149> with<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.390> case<00:00:38.710> upon<00:00:39.710> which<00:00:39.980> makes

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
has to do with the case upon which makes

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.150 
has to do with the case upon which makes
up<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.239> foundation<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.020> engine<00:00:42.500> which

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
up the foundation of the engine which

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.759 
up the foundation of the engine which
also<00:00:43.370> locates<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.089> chassis<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.050> it<00:00:45.290> what<00:00:45.680> it

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
also locates the chassis so it what it

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.100 
also locates the chassis so it what it
provides<00:00:45.949> is<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.879> way<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.420> make<00:00:47.720> a<00:00:47.750> motorcycle

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
provides is a way to make a motorcycle

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.799 
provides is a way to make a motorcycle
that<00:00:48.559> will<00:00:48.710> last<00:00:48.890> for<00:00:49.250> all<00:00:49.280> time<00:00:49.400> it's<00:00:50.120> machine

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
that will last for all time it's machine

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.590 
that will last for all time it's machine
from<00:00:51.050> 800<00:00:51.530> pounds<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.159> billet<00:00:52.940> aluminum<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
from 800 pounds of billet aluminum and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.020 
from 800 pounds of billet aluminum and
it<00:00:53.900> takes<00:00:54.230> well<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:55.070> excess<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.550> 100<00:00:55.940> hours

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
it takes well in excess of 100 hours

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.030 
it takes well in excess of 100 hours
just<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.659> create<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.050> cases<00:00:57.650> of<00:00:57.860> that

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
just to create the cases of that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.000 
just to create the cases of that
motorcycle<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.199> vision<00:01:00.649> behind

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
motorcycle and so the the vision behind

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.889 
motorcycle and so the the vision behind
the<00:01:01.100> motorcycle<00:01:01.340> was<00:01:01.789> that<00:01:01.969> we<00:01:02.120> would<00:01:02.359> create

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
the motorcycle was that we would create

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.439 
the motorcycle was that we would create
a<00:01:03.140> timeless<00:01:03.920> elegant<00:01:04.489> design<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.300> would

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
a timeless elegant design that would

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.810 
a timeless elegant design that would
actually<00:01:06.080> over<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.619> years<00:01:06.950> create<00:01:07.580> more

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
actually over the years create more

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.050 
actually over the years create more
value<00:01:08.170> more<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.289> an<00:01:09.380> heirloom<00:01:09.800> emotion<00:01:10.640> with

also with always ride like it does down

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.830 
also with always ride like it does down
the<00:01:15.830> line<00:01:16.009> over<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.520> years<00:01:16.759> like<00:01:17.420> what<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.720> was

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the line over the years like what it was

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080 
the line over the years like what it was
new<00:01:18.050> we<00:01:18.710> really<00:01:19.009> love<00:01:19.160> to<00:01:19.280> do<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.729> create

the next motorcycle the next motorcycle

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.139 
the next motorcycle the next motorcycle
is<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.030> next<00:01:23.720> generation<00:01:24.020> fighter<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.190> it's

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
is the next generation fighter and it's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.580 
is the next generation fighter and it's
already<00:01:27.080> testing<00:01:27.950> at<00:01:28.070> about<00:01:28.310> 225<00:01:29.179> horsepower

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
already testing at about 225 horsepower

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.280 
already testing at about 225 horsepower
and<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.740> most<00:01:30.920> we've<00:01:31.159> ever<00:01:31.280> done<00:01:31.460> before<00:01:31.850> is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
and the most we've ever done before is

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.590 
and the most we've ever done before is
162<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:34.400> it's<00:01:34.520> going<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.700> be<00:01:34.820> much<00:01:35.270> more

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
162 so it's going to be much more

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.350 
162 so it's going to be much more
explosive<00:01:36.100> much<00:01:37.100> more<00:01:37.369> dynamic<00:01:37.579> I<00:01:38.150> mean<00:01:38.299> I

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
explosive much more dynamic I mean I

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.810 
explosive much more dynamic I mean I
can't<00:01:38.600> wait<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:38.960> after<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.310> don't<00:01:40.759> know

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
years of production and we want to grow

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.810 
years of production and we want to grow
the<00:01:48.799> company<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.810> 135<00:01:50.810> bikes<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.439> we<00:01:51.560> are

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
the company to 135 bikes so we are

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.030 
the company to 135 bikes so we are
scaling<00:01:52.820> up<00:01:52.970> just<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.329> little<00:01:53.360> bit<00:01:53.600> now<00:01:54.040> because

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
scaling up just a little bit now because

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.280 
scaling up just a little bit now because
we<00:01:55.340> have<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:55.820> grown<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.869> new<00:01:57.049> facility

we have now grown we have a new facility
and<00:01:58.009> we<00:01:58.549> have<00:01:58.700> enough<00:01:59.030> capacity<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.840> build

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
and we have enough capacity to build

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.289 
and we have enough capacity to build
three<00:02:00.439> motorcycles<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:01.159> week<00:02:01.340> on<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:01.579> 45<00:02:02.090> week

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
three motorcycles a week on a 45 week

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.740 
three motorcycles a week on a 45 week
schedule<00:02:02.509> which<00:02:02.840> would<00:02:02.990> be<00:02:03.159> 135<00:02:04.750> motorcycles

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
schedule which would be 135 motorcycles

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.749 
schedule which would be 135 motorcycles
so<00:02:05.960> we're<00:02:06.110> gonna<00:02:06.200> grow<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.469> little<00:02:06.680> bit<00:02:06.890> but

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759
