with<00:02:37.000> classic<00:02:37.390> sonic<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:37.989> remember<00:02:38.290> back

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
with classic sonic you can remember back

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.229 
with classic sonic you can remember back
in<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.680> day<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.129> Genesis<00:02:39.610> Sonic<00:02:40.120> was

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
in the day on the Genesis Sonic was

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.729 
in the day on the Genesis Sonic was
really<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.780> matter<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.080> pressing<00:02:41.500> forward

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
really just a matter of pressing forward

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.380 
really just a matter of pressing forward
or<00:02:41.950> backwards<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.550> d-pad<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.269> he

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
or backwards on the d-pad and then he

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.780 
or backwards on the d-pad and then he
consisted<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:43.989> two<00:02:44.230> simple<00:02:44.560> moves<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:45.430> jump

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
consisted of two simple moves to jump

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.729 
consisted of two simple moves to jump
you<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.540> hit<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> button<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.470> Spin<00:02:47.709> Dash

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
you just hit a button and a Spin Dash

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.410 
you just hit a button and a Spin Dash
you<00:02:48.190> press<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.430> down<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.700> hammer<00:02:49.030> down<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you press it down and hammer down the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.789 
you press it down and hammer down the
jump<00:02:49.629> button<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.959> how<00:02:50.140> they<00:02:50.200> released<00:02:50.560> and

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
jump button is how they released and

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.500 
jump button is how they released and
Sonic<00:02:51.069> flew<00:02:51.370> across<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> screen<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.420> could

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
Sonic flew across the screen you could

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.270 
Sonic flew across the screen you could
also<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:52.930> press<00:02:53.200> down<00:02:53.410> while<00:02:53.650> running<00:02:53.920> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
also just press down while running to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.039 
also just press down while running to
turn<00:02:54.489> into<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> ball<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:55.360> basically<00:02:55.599> those

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
turn into a ball but basically those

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.630 
turn into a ball but basically those
were<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.319> two<00:02:56.440> main<00:02:56.590> controls<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.280> controls

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
were the two main controls the controls

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.670 
were the two main controls the controls
were<00:02:57.760> simple<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.599> all<00:02:58.720> honesty<00:02:58.750> it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
were simple and in all honesty it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.619 
were simple and in all honesty it
doesn't<00:03:00.160> feel<00:03:00.340> one<00:03:00.610> bit<00:03:00.640> different<00:03:01.330> on<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
doesn't feel one bit different on the

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.050 
doesn't feel one bit different on the
modern<00:03:01.930> concepts<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.620> spin<00:03:02.920> dash<00:03:03.099> has<00:03:03.730> been

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
modern concepts the spin dash has been

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.089 
modern concepts the spin dash has been
mapped<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.870> single<00:03:05.140> button<00:03:05.500> now<00:03:05.739> but<00:03:06.010> it

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
mapped to one single button now but it

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.620 
mapped to one single button now but it
can<00:03:06.190> still<00:03:06.310> be<00:03:06.459> done<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.880> classic<00:03:07.299> way<00:03:07.450> as

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
can still be done the classic way as

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.449 
can still be done the classic way as
modern<00:03:07.989> Sonic<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.620> still<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> homing

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
modern Sonic we still have the homing

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.059 
modern Sonic we still have the homing
attack<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:10.000> slide<00:03:10.299> sidestep<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.470> booze<00:03:11.739> and

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
attack the slide sidestep and booze and

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.559 
attack the slide sidestep and booze and
other<00:03:12.220> than<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.700> wins<00:03:12.910> very<00:03:13.180> well<00:03:13.420> with

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
other than that it wins very well with

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.880 
other than that it wins very well with
plastic<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.140> never<00:03:14.319> feels<00:03:14.560> out<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.799> place

I<00:03:15.310> will<00:03:15.610> admit<00:03:15.940> though<00:03:16.150> at<00:03:16.329> times<00:03:16.360> if<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.110> played

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
I will admit though at times if I played

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.050 
I will admit though at times if I played
a<00:03:17.379> lot<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.680> modern<00:03:18.160> Sonic<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:18.790> jumped

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
a lot of modern Sonic and then jumped

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.670 
a lot of modern Sonic and then jumped
over<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.269> classic<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.930> was<00:03:20.049> easy<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.319> forget

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
over the classic it was easy to forget

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
classic sonic has no voice which

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.200 
classic sonic has no voice which
actually<00:06:08.650> makes<00:06:09.040> the<00:06:09.190> cut<00:06:09.460> seems<00:06:09.700> a<00:06:09.820> bit<00:06:10.030> more

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
actually makes the cut seems a bit more

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.210 
actually makes the cut seems a bit more
entertaining<00:06:10.720> and<00:06:11.020> in<00:06:11.170> my<00:06:11.380> own<00:06:11.560> opinion<00:06:11.860> I

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
entertaining and in my own opinion I

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.980 
entertaining and in my own opinion I
feel<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.640> this<00:06:12.760> was<00:06:12.970> a<00:06:13.000> smart<00:06:13.300> choice<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:13.780> just

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
feel that this was a smart choice I just

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.750 
feel that this was a smart choice I just
can't<00:06:14.140> picture<00:06:14.410> classic<00:06:15.070> sonic<00:06:15.280> without<00:06:15.640> the
