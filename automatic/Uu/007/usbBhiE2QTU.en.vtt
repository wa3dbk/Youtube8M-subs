00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800 
now I haven't touched a cigarette since
I<00:02:06.980> think<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.550> was<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.880> easiest<00:02:08.300> part<00:02:08.690> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
I think that was the easiest part the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.450 
I think that was the easiest part the
easiest<00:02:09.020> part<00:02:09.260> was<00:02:09.530> was<00:02:09.860> stopping<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
easiest part was was stopping the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.690 
easiest part was was stopping the
cigarettes

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.880 

but<00:02:14.240> once<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.480> was<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.780> vaporizer<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.620> I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
but once I was on the vaporizer that's I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.110 
but once I was on the vaporizer that's I
would<00:02:15.950> say<00:02:16.220> let's<00:02:16.400> work<00:02:16.550> out<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> little

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
would say let's work out a little

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.360 
would say let's work out a little
trickier<00:02:17.540> because<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.709> was<00:02:18.890> actually

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
trickier because that was actually

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.390 
trickier because that was actually
trying<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.790> get<00:02:20.360> rid<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.870> hobby<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:22.250> was
