00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.180 
that but I enjoy more rustic ingredients
and<00:03:30.739> simple<00:03:31.489> food<00:03:31.760> but<00:03:32.030> at<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.900> same<00:03:33.049> time<00:03:33.290> you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
and simple food but at the same time you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.640 
and simple food but at the same time you
can<00:03:34.370> definitely<00:03:34.519> play<00:03:34.910> with<00:03:35.389> global<00:03:35.840> flavors

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
can definitely play with global flavors

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.550 
can definitely play with global flavors
and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.589 
and
and<00:03:37.980> make<00:03:38.550> something<00:03:38.880> that's<00:03:39.060> fairly

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
and make something that's fairly

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.390 
and make something that's fairly
traditional<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> flavor<00:03:40.890> profile<00:03:41.280> could

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
traditional but the flavor profile could

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.430 
traditional but the flavor profile could
be<00:03:41.489> completely<00:03:41.880> different<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.360> think<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.230> key

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
be completely different I think the key

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.350 
be completely different I think the key
to<00:03:43.470> staying<00:03:43.770> relevant<00:03:44.160> now<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.730> making<00:03:45.180> sure

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
to staying relevant now is making sure

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.949 
to staying relevant now is making sure
that<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:46.250> are<00:03:47.250> eating<00:03:47.489> out<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.599> seeing

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
that you are eating out and and seeing

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.680
