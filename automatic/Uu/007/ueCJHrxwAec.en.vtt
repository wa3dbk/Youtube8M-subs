00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.380 

antidiuretic<00:00:26.810> hormone<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.890> produced<00:00:27.980> in<00:00:28.730> a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
antidiuretic hormone is produced in a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.950 
antidiuretic hormone is produced in a
region<00:00:29.750> of<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.900> brain<00:00:30.050> here<00:00:31.239> known<00:00:32.239> as<00:00:32.270> the

region of the brain here known as the
hypothalamus<00:00:37.510> like<00:00:38.510> all<00:00:38.750> hormones<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:39.739> flows

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
hypothalamus like all hormones it flows

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.530 
hypothalamus like all hormones it flows
through<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.180> bloodstream<00:00:41.449> and<00:00:43.180> its<00:00:44.180> target

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
through the bloodstream and its target

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:53.710 
through the bloodstream and its target
is<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.829> kidney<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:51.379> effect<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.720> antidiuretic

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
is the kidney the effect of antidiuretic

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.110 
is the kidney the effect of antidiuretic
hormone<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:56.360> control<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.530> alter<00:00:58.340> the

composition or the quantity of water
which<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.780> in<00:01:02.989> blood<00:01:04.990> so<00:01:05.990> antidiuretic

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
which is in blood so antidiuretic

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.919 
which is in blood so antidiuretic
hormone<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:07.899> d<00:01:08.899> h<00:01:09.520> has<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.789> ability<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.509> make

hormone a d h has the ability to make

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.300 
hormone a d h has the ability to make
the<00:01:12.140> blood<00:01:12.369> more<00:01:13.369> or<00:01:13.640> less<00:01:14.119> concentrated<00:01:14.929> and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
the blood more or less concentrated and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.820 
the blood more or less concentrated and
we'll<00:01:16.310> remember<00:01:16.640> from<00:01:17.090> previous<00:01:17.300> work<00:01:18.110> how

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
we'll remember from previous work how

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.760 
we'll remember from previous work how
the<00:01:18.890> importance<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.470> establish<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the importance is to establish that the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.109 
the importance is to establish that the
tissue<00:01:22.009> fluid<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.990> isotonic<00:01:24.820> our<00:01:25.820> tissue

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
tissue fluid is isotonic our tissue

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.840 
tissue fluid is isotonic our tissue
fluid<00:01:26.420> here<00:01:26.929> is<00:01:27.310> isotonic<00:01:28.310> with<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
fluid here is isotonic with the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.740 
fluid here is isotonic with the
cytoplasm<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.869> cell<00:01:31.180> this<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.420> role

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
cytoplasm of the cell this is the role

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
cytoplasm of the cell this is the role
of<00:01:32.780> ADH

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.399 

ADH<00:01:37.240> actually<00:01:38.230> targets<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:40.690> collecting<00:01:41.470> duct

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.389 

so<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> target<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.789> D<00:01:48.600> H<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.679> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so this is the target for a D H and the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.669 
so this is the target for a D H and the
effect<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> ADH<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.909> allows<00:01:54.679> more

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
effect of ADH is that it allows more

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:04.840 
effect of ADH is that it allows more
water<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:01.439> come<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.729> collecting<00:02:03.210> duct

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
water to come out of the collecting duct

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
water to come out of the collecting duct
so<00:02:05.850> already<00:02:06.240> we've<00:02:06.569> learned<00:02:06.959> that<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so already we've learned that the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.830 
so already we've learned that the
collecting<00:02:08.009> duct<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:09.709> responsible<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.739> water

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
collecting duct is responsible for water

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.300 
collecting duct is responsible for water
so<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.049> collecting<00:02:13.560> duct<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.099> where

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so in the collecting duct this is where

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.690 
so in the collecting duct this is where
water<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:21.110> selectively<00:02:22.250> reabsorbed<00:02:23.250> into<00:02:23.519> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
water is selectively reabsorbed into the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.910 
water is selectively reabsorbed into the
blood<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:25.769> it's<00:02:25.890> possible<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> increase<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
blood but it's possible to increase the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.890 
blood but it's possible to increase the
amount<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.250> water<00:02:29.459> going<00:02:29.670> into<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> blood<00:02:30.390> by

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
amount of water going into the blood by

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.410 
amount of water going into the blood by
applying<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.620> hormone<00:02:32.420> antidiuretic

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
applying the hormone antidiuretic

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.699 
applying the hormone antidiuretic
hormone<00:02:33.769> ADH<00:02:35.599> ADH<00:02:36.599> actually<00:02:37.170> makes<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
hormone ADH ADH actually makes the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.690 
hormone ADH ADH actually makes the
collecting<00:02:38.310> duct<00:02:38.519> walls<00:02:38.849> more<00:02:39.810> porous<00:02:40.700> so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
collecting duct walls more porous so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.580 
collecting duct walls more porous so
that<00:02:41.849> more<00:02:42.090> water<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:43.530> actually<00:02:43.860> escape<00:02:45.590> from

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that more water can actually escape from

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.550 
that more water can actually escape from
the<00:02:46.739> collecting<00:02:47.190> duct<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:48.360> water<00:02:48.690> goes

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
the collecting duct and this water goes

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.140 
the collecting duct and this water goes
back<00:02:49.590> into<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.579> blood

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.390 

the<00:02:56.080> consequence<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.239> ADH<00:02:58.239> secretion<00:02:59.010> is<00:03:00.010> that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
the consequence of ADH secretion is that

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.330 
the consequence of ADH secretion is that
the<00:03:00.670> urine<00:03:01.239> coming<00:03:02.170> from<00:03:02.409> here<00:03:03.010> would<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.269> more

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
the urine coming from here would be more

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.039 
the urine coming from here would be more
concentrated<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:08.769> would<00:03:08.920> have<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.519> lower

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
concentrated and it would have a lower

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:16.199 
concentrated and it would have a lower
volume<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:13.180> with<00:03:13.360> ADHD<00:03:14.079> chr√©tien<00:03:14.909> more<00:03:15.909> water

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
volume so with ADHD chr√©tien more water

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.869 
volume so with ADHD chr√©tien more water
goes<00:03:16.540> back<00:03:16.569> into<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.230> blood<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:18.489> urine

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
goes back into the blood the urine

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.630 
goes back into the blood the urine
becomes<00:03:19.090> more<00:03:19.540> concentrated<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.680> volume

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
becomes more concentrated and the volume

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.479 
becomes more concentrated and the volume
decreases<00:03:23.040> students<00:03:24.040> might<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.459> to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
decreases students might like to

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.680 
decreases students might like to
consider<00:03:25.319> what<00:03:26.319> is<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.470> ADH<00:03:27.340> response<00:03:28.239> how

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
consider what is the ADH response how
