your<00:03:20.400> fighting<00:03:20.730> style<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.840> focus

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
your fighting style you you know focus

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.379 
your fighting style you you know focus
on<00:03:22.620> certain<00:03:22.980> attacks<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.579> we<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.209> new

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
on certain attacks so we have a new

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.449 
on certain attacks so we have a new
hardware<00:03:24.750> new<00:03:24.900> graphics<00:03:25.530> technology<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.280> so

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
hardware new graphics technology and so

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.789 
hardware new graphics technology and so
we<00:03:26.700> really<00:03:27.000> wanted<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.359> present<00:03:27.510> blood<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
we really wanted to present blood in the

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.740 
we really wanted to present blood in the
most<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.639> sounds<00:03:29.940> like<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.060> real<00:03:30.239> real

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
most you know it sounds like a real real

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.809 
most you know it sounds like a real real
word<00:03:31.109> but<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.950> realistic<00:03:32.430> approach<00:03:32.760> to

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
word but it's the realistic approach to

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.479 
word but it's the realistic approach to
blood<00:03:33.470> not<00:03:34.470> many<00:03:34.650> people<00:03:34.829> have<00:03:35.040> seen<00:03:35.280> blood

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
blood not many people have seen blood

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.920 
blood not many people have seen blood
flying<00:03:35.849> all<00:03:36.030> over<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.239> place<00:03:36.329> in<00:03:36.540> real<00:03:36.720> life

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
flying all over the place in real life

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.599 
flying all over the place in real life
but<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:37.829> wanted<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.130> make<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.280> look<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
but we really wanted to make it look a

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.780 
but we really wanted to make it look a
little<00:03:38.760> less<00:03:39.000> cartoony<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.560> less

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
little less cartoony a little less

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.740 
little less cartoony a little less
saturated<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.000> colors<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
saturated with the colors so it's a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.240 
saturated with the colors so it's a
little<00:03:42.959> darker<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.380> little<00:03:43.650> more<00:03:43.769> serious

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
little darker a little more serious

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.599 
little darker a little more serious
approach<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.910> presenting<00:03:45.480> blood<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.609> that

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
approach to presenting blood and that

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:48.860 
approach to presenting blood and that
really<00:03:47.880> comes<00:03:48.060> through<00:03:48.299> when<00:03:48.419> you<00:03:48.540> see<00:03:48.720> the
