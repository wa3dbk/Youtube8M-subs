00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
I was going out there looking from h2

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.810 
I was going out there looking from h2
tech<00:00:08.559> video<00:00:08.860> say<00:00:09.219> we're<00:00:09.340> gonna<00:00:09.459> be<00:00:09.519> doing<00:00:09.700> a

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
tech video say we're gonna be doing a

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.000 
tech video say we're gonna be doing a
size<00:00:10.030> comparison<00:00:10.240> between<00:00:10.869> the<00:00:11.200> new<00:00:11.410> iPad

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
size comparison between the new iPad

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.589 
size comparison between the new iPad
Mini<00:00:12.039> 3<00:00:12.340> and<00:00:12.879> the<00:00:13.629> Galaxy<00:00:14.230> Tab<00:00:14.500> s<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:19.480> it

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
Mini 3 and the Galaxy Tab s so here it

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.650 
Mini 3 and the Galaxy Tab s so here it
is<00:00:20.369> now<00:00:21.369> keep<00:00:21.550> in<00:00:21.700> mind<00:00:21.730> that<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.119> iPad<00:00:22.420> Mini

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
is now keep in mind that the iPad Mini

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.480 
is now keep in mind that the iPad Mini
gives<00:00:22.930> a<00:00:23.020> 7.9<00:00:23.830> inch<00:00:24.060> display<00:00:25.060> and<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.650> iPad

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
gives a 7.9 inch display and the iPad

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.689 
gives a 7.9 inch display and the iPad
excuse<00:00:27.970> me<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.420> Galaxy<00:00:28.900> Tab<00:00:29.050> s<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.619> an<00:00:29.830> 8.4

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
excuse me the Galaxy Tab s is an 8.4

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.119 
excuse me the Galaxy Tab s is an 8.4
inch<00:00:30.730> display<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:31.930> first<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.559> all<00:00:32.710> if<00:00:32.800> we<00:00:32.890> just

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
inch display so first of all if we just

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.639 
inch display so first of all if we just
line<00:00:33.430> up<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.820> screens<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:35.109> see<00:00:35.320> how<00:00:35.469> much

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
line up the screens you see how much

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.469 
line up the screens you see how much
extra<00:00:36.039> real<00:00:36.190> estate<00:00:36.460> you<00:00:36.640> do<00:00:36.819> get<00:00:37.030> on<00:00:37.179> the<00:00:37.269> tab

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.479 
extra real estate you do get on the tab

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.040 
extra real estate you do get on the tab
s<00:00:37.749> versus<00:00:38.229> the<00:00:38.379> Mini<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:39.609> then<00:00:40.600> if<00:00:40.719> we<00:00:40.839> take

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
s versus the Mini and then if we take

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.349 
s versus the Mini and then if we take
them<00:00:41.289> this<00:00:41.530> way<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:45.120> slightly<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.300> little

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
them this way see that slightly a little

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.649 
them this way see that slightly a little
bit<00:00:46.809> less<00:00:47.019> on<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.319> edge<00:00:48.089> so<00:00:49.089> that's<00:00:49.299> where<00:00:49.539> you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
bit less on the edge so that's where you

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:56.099 
bit less on the edge so that's where you
lose<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:50.260> hair<00:00:52.920> flip<00:00:53.920> them<00:00:54.129> over<00:00:54.929> take<00:00:55.929> a<00:00:55.959> look

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
lose a hair flip them over take a look

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.899 
lose a hair flip them over take a look
at<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.289> design<00:00:56.649> so<00:00:57.010> these<00:00:57.129> are<00:00:57.280> both<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.609> gold

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
at the design so these are both the gold

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.469 
at the design so these are both the gold
options<00:00:59.100> the<00:01:00.100> backing<00:01:00.549> on<00:01:00.729> here<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:01.239> goal<00:01:01.449> is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
options the backing on here the goal is

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.629 
options the backing on here the goal is
a<00:01:01.629> slightly<00:01:02.019> different<00:01:02.309> whereas<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.429> have<00:01:03.609> a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
a slightly different whereas you have a

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.289 
a slightly different whereas you have a
shiny<00:01:03.999> just<00:01:04.299> a<00:01:04.390> real<00:01:04.570> basic<00:01:04.750> gold<00:01:05.199> on<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.500> iPad

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
shiny just a real basic gold on the iPad

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.710 
shiny just a real basic gold on the iPad
and<00:01:07.299> you<00:01:08.200> turn<00:01:08.890> them<00:01:09.070> sideways<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:10.150> compare<00:01:10.780> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and you turn them sideways and compare I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.630 
and you turn them sideways and compare I
would<00:01:13.720> say<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:14.200> these<00:01:14.380> are<00:01:14.440> probably<00:01:15.040> pretty

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
would say that these are probably pretty

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.420 
would say that these are probably pretty
evenly<00:01:16.090> matched<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.930> terms<00:01:17.830> of<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.190> thinness

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
evenly matched in terms of the thinness

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.730 
evenly matched in terms of the thinness
doesn't<00:01:19.210> seem<00:01:19.390> like<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:19.900> is<00:01:20.140> there<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.590> other

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
doesn't seem like one is there the other

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.700 
doesn't seem like one is there the other
I<00:01:21.040> could<00:01:21.430> say<00:01:21.730> that<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.150> Tab<00:01:22.840> s<00:01:23.140> may<00:01:23.470> have<00:01:23.680> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
I could say that the Tab s may have a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.970 
I could say that the Tab s may have a
slight<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.030> too<00:01:25.600> close<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.140> tell<00:01:26.650> Lily

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
slight but it's too close to tell Lily

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.640 
slight but it's too close to tell Lily
that's<00:01:27.370> how<00:01:27.870> close<00:01:28.870> they<00:01:29.080> are<00:01:29.260> so<00:01:29.500> that's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
that's how close they are so that's

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.080 
that's how close they are so that's
awesome<00:01:32.010> bezel<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:33.100> going<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.370> be<00:01:33.520> pretty<00:01:34.060> much

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
awesome bezel is going to be pretty much

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.770 
awesome bezel is going to be pretty much
the<00:01:34.270> same<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.560> our<00:01:35.800> bezel<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.790> iPad

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
the same and our bezel is the iPad

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.420 
the same and our bezel is the iPad
doesn't<00:01:38.050> want<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.380> rotate<00:01:38.500> back<00:01:38.980> because<00:01:39.280> he

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
doesn't want to rotate back because he

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.760 
doesn't want to rotate back because he
likes<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:40.000> sit<00:01:40.240> in<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.390> position

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.260 

it's<00:01:45.770> always<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> role<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.550> him<00:01:46.790> there

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
it's always that the role of him there

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.210 
it's always that the role of him there
we<00:01:47.420> go<00:01:47.600> all<00:01:48.530> right<00:01:50.410> yep<00:01:51.440> probably<00:01:51.920> say<00:01:52.070> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
we go all right yep probably say the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.910 
we go all right yep probably say the
bezels<00:01:52.670> are<00:01:52.880> just<00:01:53.300> about<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.750> same<00:01:54.050> in<00:01:54.860> terms

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
bezels are just about the same in terms

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.230 
bezels are just about the same in terms
of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.730> thinness<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:58.220> do<00:01:58.430> notice<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.910> that

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
of the thinness you do notice that that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.750 
of the thinness you do notice that that
the<00:01:59.420> bottom<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.830> tablet<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.460> little

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the bottom of the tablet it's a little

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.540 
the bottom of the tablet it's a little
bit<00:02:01.880> shorter<00:02:02.300> because<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.960> round<00:02:03.950> button<00:02:04.340> here

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
bit shorter because of round button here

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.670 
bit shorter because of round button here
versus<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> flat<00:02:05.450> button<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:08.440> kind<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.500> have

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
versus a flat button and kind of have

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.700 
versus a flat button and kind of have
this<00:02:09.890> brown<00:02:10.520> color<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.870> front<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.230> us<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
this brown color the front of us is the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.740 
this brown color the front of us is the
white<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:15.160> but<00:02:16.160> that's<00:02:16.340> about<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.640> guys<00:02:19.750> we

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
white so but that's about it guys we

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.710 
white so but that's about it guys we
already<00:02:20.930> did<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.380> way<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.610> feel<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:26.210> it's

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
already did this way so I feel like it's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.870 
already did this way so I feel like it's
a<00:02:26.810> little<00:02:27.080> bit<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> bezel<00:02:27.920> con<00:02:28.460> around<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
a little bit the bezel con around the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.050 
a little bit the bezel con around the
edges<00:02:29.210> a<00:02:29.300> little<00:02:29.330> bit<00:02:29.720> shinier<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.880> tab<00:02:32.120> s

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
edges a little bit shinier on the tab s

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.010 
edges a little bit shinier on the tab s
in<00:02:35.060> terms<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.900> weight<00:02:37.600> say<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.780> they're

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
in terms of the weight say that they're

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.600 
in terms of the weight say that they're
pretty<00:02:39.560> even<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:40.550> terms<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.380> thickness

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
pretty even in terms of the thickness

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.920 
pretty even in terms of the thickness
big<00:02:43.610> difference<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.330> be<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.660> screen

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
big difference is going to be the screen

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.660 
big difference is going to be the screen
quality<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.590> obviously<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:46.190> we're<00:02:46.370> taking

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
quality and obviously now we're taking

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.000 
quality and obviously now we're taking
deeper<00:02:46.970> into<00:02:47.270> what<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.660> not<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> size

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
deeper into what is not just the size

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.760 
deeper into what is not just the size
but<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:50.690> has<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:52.570> 2560<00:02:53.570> by<00:02:53.690> 1440<00:02:54.110> display

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
but this has a 2560 by 1440 display

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.100 
but this has a 2560 by 1440 display
whereas<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:56.140> iPad<00:02:57.140> Mini<00:02:58.750> that's<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.870> little

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
whereas the iPad Mini that's a little

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.590 
whereas the iPad Mini that's a little
bit<00:03:00.230> over<00:03:00.440> tunity<00:03:00.769> resolution<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.180> looks

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
bit over tunity resolution but it looks

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.259 
bit over tunity resolution but it looks
like<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.050> S<00:03:03.769> does<00:03:04.550> look<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.790> little<00:03:04.910> bit<00:03:05.120> better

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
like the S does look a little bit better

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.900 
like the S does look a little bit better
in<00:03:05.480> terms<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.930> quality<00:03:06.140> but<00:03:07.010> anyway<00:03:07.519> this

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
in terms of the quality but anyway this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.630 
in terms of the quality but anyway this
is<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.300> guys<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:08.690> wanted<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> basic
