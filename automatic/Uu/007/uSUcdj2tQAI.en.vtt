it's<00:00:21.800> actually<00:00:21.980> working<00:00:22.369> which<00:00:22.669> is<00:00:22.699> nice

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
it's actually working which is nice

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.159

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
gig SSD in there if we take a look

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.229 
gig SSD in there if we take a look
around<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.980> system<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.670> has<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.030> Kensington

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
lock a us two USB ports here then there

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.459 
lock a us two USB ports here then there
is<00:00:57.289> a<00:00:57.649> SD<00:00:58.159> card<00:00:58.429> slot<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:58.730> full-size<00:00:59.359> one<00:00:59.780> if<00:01:00.379> we

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
is a SD card slot a full-size one if we

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.079 
is a SD card slot a full-size one if we
take<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.649> look<00:01:00.800> around<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.159> bottom<00:01:01.550> we<00:01:01.730> can<00:01:01.850> see

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
take a look around the bottom we can see

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.819 
take a look around the bottom we can see
that<00:01:02.239> there<00:01:02.420> are<00:01:02.449> some<00:01:02.749> speakers<00:01:03.289> here<00:01:03.620> and

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
that there are some speakers here and

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.100 
that there are some speakers here and
then<00:01:04.340> there's<00:01:04.520> a<00:01:04.610> slot<00:01:04.940> for<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.330> heat<00:01:05.690> escape

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
then there's a slot for the heat escape

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.340 
then there's a slot for the heat escape
which<00:01:07.040> is<00:01:07.070> very<00:01:07.490> very<00:01:08.420> exciting<00:01:08.870> to<00:01:09.020> keep<00:01:09.140> your

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
trackpad very briefly you did notice

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.540 
trackpad very briefly you did notice
that<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.900> pull<00:01:30.110> in<00:01:30.200> off<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.500> side<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.950> we

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
that we can pull in off the side and we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.220 
that we can pull in off the side and we
can<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.910> kind<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.180> swipe<00:01:32.390> around<00:01:32.540> but<00:01:33.050> it

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
can to kind of swipe around but it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.350 
can to kind of swipe around but it
doesn't<00:01:33.260> have<00:01:33.980> any<00:01:34.190> integrated<00:01:34.700> mouse

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
doesn't have any integrated mouse
