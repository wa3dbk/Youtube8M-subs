 the whole was held by Tim Cook and co-workers Panetta 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.610

 to find out about Apple stores in China 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 a lot of numbers and repetitions to Ayew is free 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.550
 There were also comparisons 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.989
 from the wind 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.240
 and Next 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.870
 and he also some facts about alternative 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.230
 came to the iPhone 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.289
 the 5 percent that in the worldwide mobile phone market meanwhile 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.750
 the iPad has a share of 74 percent 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.550
 on the tablet market 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.230
 In total there are 250 million a lawyer devices 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.460
 43 percent of mobile systems are controlled by Taylor 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.720
 then the couch was introduced 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.170
 it's easy to use maps 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.300
 Send Anette which then by mail 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.649
 where the switches send Actress fourth receiver 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.189
 So you can design a card with the iPhone and iPad Alper Tat 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.280
 a few percent the card for a kind the whole 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.380
 costs 4 $ 99 in Europe 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.120
 is about equivalent 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.240
 four euros 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.350
 the whole then costs 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.450
 choose was in a hurry us5 presented a whole lot again 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.390
 a boy 5 is released on 12 believes Bobo 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.550
 So there I can that each of you can load and then solve 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.760
 under Manama we write all messages via one 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.900
 metrology-owned businesses 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.220
 as the main course in shipping is still to speak 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.140
 he could look forward to it 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.250
 that became a new feature 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.440
 called find my friends 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.289

 that we are allowed to use his location data 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.600
 if we look at it at any time to see how far this friend way is 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.449
 out of that became a new iPod Nano middle 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.509
 so to speak an operating system turns off 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:21.059
 There is now a tattoo with Cher instead of this single ERC 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.410
 and for 16 and peace 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.839
 There is also a bracelet right now 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.030
 and you can, so to speak, now place an Alcott Nano as a clock 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.919

 the whole thing is about to be on the plates of the Beatbox 3 60 player but oven 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.629
 Of course the scope is not quite as strong 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.939
 the new iPhone 4s 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.069

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.489
 it has the same as the iPhone 4 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.289
 and he has 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:17.229
 an important role is 3g speed of up to 15 point 4 maier-witt pro 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.129
 second 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.699
 It has full HD video recordings 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.509
 with image stabilizer and noise cancellation and one important 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.080
 the year of the camera with 8 megapixels 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.699

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.020
 the cowls 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.760
 after that 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.340
 Newcomer 5 seconds 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.479
 It has some point of view detection and can take macro pictures

 and it has a new lighting system the winter has gotten bigger and 5 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.229
 optical lenses were installed which makes the lighting better and the 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.759
 Quality much better 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.639
 You can take a look at some examples. "I'll 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.639
 now easily link in the video description 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.639
 besides, there is the new feature we do 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.779
 this company had bought adware and so could now with your Altona 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.480
 For example, talking about how many days are there until 24 Cen 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.430
 December 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.610
 or how many days are left until Christmas and the device will show you 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.310
 all in days of just a few hours a week everything you like 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.719
 wanted to" 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.059
 by asking how the weather will be tomorrow in San Francisco 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.650
 or in percent Berlin and the iPhone shows you the corresponding data 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.589
 but you can also say that 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.629
 How much this SMS in front of the iPhone will read you the SMS and you can 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:34.460
 then say 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.089
 answer 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.289
 I'll be back to the meeting a little later tomorrow please or her 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.470
 can also say two of 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.170
 if I do not remember 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.170
 the Hotel Palace that my wife call » 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.800
 The iPhone can now answer complete questions 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.210
 You do not have to go back to voice control 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.319
 who had a shit detection anyway 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.770
 certain sentences or something announcements but you can with right 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.570
 Kaczmarczyk 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.420
 and right sentences work and the iPhone also answers in the right way 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.990
 records 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.569
 for example, it is also possible to ask questions 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:08.580
 around 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.729
 how much money like each of us or 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.620
 find a capable experience in Berlin for me and it will be just like everyone 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.300
 in mind 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.930
 on lists in each case after the evaluation 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.660
 the iPhone 4s can be seen after the seventh are still gate so this one 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.770
 Friday presented 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.770
 and it will come out on the 14th of October 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.710
 Of course, it will bring a lot of new things per cent 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.960
 and how it works with better Airstream one that Wikipedia bought 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960
 and many other applications 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.370
 and the iPhone comes in 16 32 or 64's work 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.610
 the question is now 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.440
 I would like to ask you to comment on one of the 32 gigabytes 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.570
 or get the 64 gigabyte iPhone 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.620
 I'm not sure 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.080
 my ipod touch off at 32 the work 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.200
 just three each at free but also because only courage because there are still photos 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.729
 absence 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.320
 I have not synchronized on it yet and then I'm in the fall holidays 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.880
 Israel and there you have to take many photos and videos and make 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:08.809
 Percent then the memory will be relatively fast consequences to 64 little 

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:11.649
 Gigabyte Indira Weis full-hd is huge 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:15.330
 so if you like the comments, how do you find the new iPhone I know 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.080
 none of the ERC has a bigger screen 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.039
 but I'm not that bad either 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.589
 Wyatt 

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:24.189
 That would be the battery consumption would rise extremely 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.300
 and the Mattner Vettel is lost and you will suddenly pixels again 

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:28.369
 See the display 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:30.590
 and who I think that's not so good 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.590
 I think the size is really sufficient 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.839
 the design is also beautiful from the iPhone 4 so I'm convinced 

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:42.110
 I also know that many girls have fallen into the earth file too 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.719
 understand if you have expectations but are only disappointed or the 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:47.069
 Expectation of life to be fulfilled 

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:49.839
 That's why I rarely set expectations for something like that 

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.770
 i would definitely cool i think i'll buy it 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.339
 a because of that 

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:56.440
 Thank you for listening 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.469
 and I want you one more wonderful day 

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:59.109
 Goodbye
