00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.840
 and here we are in a case like the federation and we are 

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.019
 on the stand of regulars focus 6 we are preparing a nice surprise to 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.820
 a nice surprise yes you see it on the screen which is the rc30 way on 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.179
 wii 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.690
 but it is on wii is seen more on pc and it still 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.490
 and that's okay it's gonna change a bit it's okay 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.920
 get others to use the really intolerable short payment that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.960
 It can 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.279
 sometimes we were quite surprised by this version of trackmania wii 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.140
 since almost all the content that was present on the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.789
 previous versions of trackmania 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.520
 then we find 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.500
 the independent differences in accidents of the novel did not submit 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 for dr australia stadium alain destandau 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.070
 % and so it's just ugly people do that's the hope of here 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.340
 why there is no crime 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.890
 the padres asked simply because the mobility 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.960
 it was difficult actually to manage large buildings in terms of survival 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.810
 technically this is graphically it's quite difficult to manage so there is 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.790
 not being able to erase the scars on the table for the one thing that 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.890
 lack of what can be done 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.190
 we can do almost all ben here is the case of mauthausen holden our 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.700
 platform 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.230
 new circuits 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.840
 he was going to change circuit 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.289
 they said it was still pretty good 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.900
 apparently having the multiplayer that is pretty friendly 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.150
 then run more played live as on pc 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.210
 the agreement is played another site that is to say 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.170
 after the meal they could also play four year crance pitt is 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 so that's a bit of happiness on the metropolis like this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960
 later on a big screen still remembers that of a beautiful screen that 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.929
 can be nice very comfortable very nice 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.300
 away they played little 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.480
 the congo 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.810
 we do not wish to play at the pace of a hair 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.649
 you can play with the steering wheel if the balloon is a crossroads leading to 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.900
 neighborhood turn the steering wheel for me to turn that so it takes pretty much 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.820
 we expect anyway in the municipality as for other members 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.860
 and 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.900
 the pq and then and then follow the rule set today to favorite 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.760
 aerial and the level buyer there is neither your level exactly can create 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.510
 your own your own circuits in the foreword courson and exchange them 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.980
 then between friends it's a real this amazing announcement converting that 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.530
 it's very very very complicated 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.049
 good by cons I do not see a little wait because it's not going out 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.700
 right away sixty-six years 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.340
 except two goals early 2010 so patience patience patience to all 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.660
 amateurs exactly those who play on pc and wii consoles then for their 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.560
 little cousins ​​or their parents because most have always 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.270
 Ben voila you can at the pot and plays with the trackmania on wii 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.039
 quite a good pick we are happy in any case of 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.859
 of having to have seen that we are glad we presented it we are 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.929
 very happy to go out as soon as possible we are 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.189
 so 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.350
 for years 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.080
 but surely 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.479
 yeah you're right to talk about him 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.149
 it's your anniversary of trouble with his services that it was his birthday 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.389
 that we celebrate a little bit with these funds 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.869
 a little champagne I m'insurge I m'insurge it's not true I do not 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.249
 see who can champagne consume it in moderation here go 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.579
