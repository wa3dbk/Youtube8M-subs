right hand of this so then you start off
playing<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.590> I'll<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.010> play<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.399> let

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
playing the I'll just play it and let

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.800 
playing the I'll just play it and let
you<00:01:02.579> watch<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.740 

and<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.619> thing<00:01:11.750> but

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and you don't have to do this thing but

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.179 
and you don't have to do this thing but
it<00:01:12.869> makes<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.049> sound<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.590> closer<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.100> how

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it makes it sound a little closer to how

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
it makes it sound a little closer to how
it's<00:01:14.369> played<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> actual<00:01:15.299> song<00:01:15.540> plus<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it's played in the actual song plus I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's played in the actual song plus I
think<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.439> funner<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> play<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.189> way

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
think it's funner to play it that way

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:33.800 
think it's funner to play it that way
you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.970> choose<00:01:18.450> however<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> prefer

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.760 

okay<00:01:34.810> I'll<00:01:34.990> go<00:01:35.110> over<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.320> rest<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.650> later

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
okay I'll go over the rest of it later

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.100 
okay I'll go over the rest of it later
so<00:01:36.340> here's<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.640> plate<00:01:36.909> bottom<00:01:37.330> hand<00:01:37.509> portion<00:01:37.840> of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
so here's a plate bottom hand portion of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.070 
so here's a plate bottom hand portion of
it<00:01:38.229> still<00:01:38.979> fairly<00:01:39.400> basic<00:01:39.690> once<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.750> start<00:01:40.960> off

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
it still fairly basic once you start off

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.680

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
goes it's C B G E and that's it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.369 
goes it's C B G E and that's it
I<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.560> play<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.859> over<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.370> over<00:03:04.379> now

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379

tricky<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.019> had<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.169> practice<00:03:11.530> playing<00:03:11.769> it

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
tricky I just had to practice playing it

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.199 
tricky I just had to practice playing it
over<00:03:11.949> and<00:03:12.099> over<00:03:12.310> again<00:03:12.579> till<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.909> could<00:03:13.060> just

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
over and over again till I could just

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.110 
over and over again till I could just
get<00:03:13.329> him<00:03:13.449> to<00:03:13.540> play<00:03:13.719> in<00:03:13.780> sync<00:03:14.169> but<00:03:15.040> here's<00:03:15.969> how<00:03:16.090> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
get him to play in sync but here's how I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.629 
get him to play in sync but here's how I
play<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.419> bottom<00:03:16.599> hand<00:03:16.900> portion<00:03:17.199> of<00:03:17.409> that

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
play the bottom hand portion of that

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.819 
play the bottom hand portion of that
it's<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:19.509> same<00:03:19.750> chord<00:03:20.109> progression<00:03:20.169> that<00:03:20.769> I

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
it's the same chord progression that I

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.410 
it's the same chord progression that I
did<00:03:21.099> in<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.310> very<00:03:21.430> beginning<00:03:21.819> of<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:21.970> song

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.910 

here

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.470 

and<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.490> part<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.730> pretty<00:03:32.880> tricky<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.360> play

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
and this part is pretty tricky to play

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.480 
and this part is pretty tricky to play
with<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.750> upper<00:03:33.990> hand<00:03:34.170> going<00:03:34.380> at<00:03:35.190> least<00:03:35.310> it

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
with that upper hand going at least it

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.080 
with that upper hand going at least it
was<00:03:35.580> for<00:03:35.790> me<00:03:35.910> maybe<00:03:36.569> won't<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.990> for<00:03:37.170> you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
was for me maybe won't be for you

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.670 
was for me maybe won't be for you
so<00:03:38.750> I'll<00:03:38.810> play<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.080> together<00:03:39.200> real<00:03:39.500> quick

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
so I'll play that together real quick

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.220 
so I'll play that together real quick
just<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.010> can<00:03:40.130> hear<00:03:40.310> what<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.459> sound<00:03:41.230> so

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
just so you can hear what it sound so

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.170 
just so you can hear what it sound so
here's<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.770> beginning<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.700> guitar<00:03:43.940> solo

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
here's the beginning of the guitar solo

00:03:44.180 --> 00:04:15.830 
here's the beginning of the guitar solo
portion

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.120 

okay<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.049> now<00:04:17.200> here's<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.799> end<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.040> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
okay and now here's the end of the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.979 
okay and now here's the end of the
guitar<00:04:18.250> solo<00:04:18.700> portion<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.419> after<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:19.750> goes

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
guitar solo portion and after this goes

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.280 
guitar solo portion and after this goes
straight<00:04:20.169> into<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> bridge<00:04:21.120> okay<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.960> let's

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
straight into the bridge okay and let's

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.650 
straight into the bridge okay and let's
see<00:04:23.500> this<00:04:24.370> part<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.669> pretty<00:04:24.700> easy<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:25.210> just<00:04:25.240> do

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
see this part is pretty easy you just do

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:35.159 
see this part is pretty easy you just do
a<00:04:27.450> f<00:04:28.450> g<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.410> b<00:04:30.210> c<00:04:31.210> bc<00:04:32.169> e<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:34.450> that's<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.720> very<00:04:34.960> end

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
a f g a b c bc e and that's the very end

portion for that I do I play the chords

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.890 
portion for that I do I play the chords
a<00:04:58.180> bit<00:04:58.300> differently

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
a bit differently

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.260 
a bit differently
I<00:04:58.930> do<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.010> octave<00:05:00.600> then<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.690> play<00:05:01.900> E<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.790> C<00:05:04.150> and

I do the octave then I play E and C and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
I do the octave then I play E and C and
a<00:05:04.450> at<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.690> same<00:05:04.870> time

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.110 

and<00:05:15.860> that's<00:05:16.040> the<00:05:16.190> lower<00:05:16.340> hand<00:05:16.640> part<00:05:16.850> for<00:05:17.030> that

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
and that's the lower hand part for that

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.040 
and that's the lower hand part for that
song<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:17.510> really<00:05:17.600> not<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:17.900> hard

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
song it's really not that hard

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.110 
song it's really not that hard
especially<00:05:18.770> well<00:05:19.010> if<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.760> don't<00:05:19.940> have<00:05:20.030> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
especially well if you don't have the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.050 
especially well if you don't have the
slower<00:05:20.330> hand<00:05:20.600> part<00:05:20.840> down<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.110> can<00:05:21.230> be<00:05:21.320> tricky

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.760 

and<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:25.020> don't<00:05:25.080> know<00:05:25.230> if<00:05:25.290> you<00:05:25.350> don't<00:05:25.440> I'm<00:05:25.590> very

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
and I don't know if you don't I'm very

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.020 
and I don't know if you don't I'm very
back<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.070> you<00:05:26.250> could<00:05:26.370> always<00:05:26.490> play<00:05:26.730> it<00:05:26.880> this

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
back and you could always play it this

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.830 
back and you could always play it this
way

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.280 

but<00:05:35.530> if<00:05:35.680> you<00:05:35.800> can<00:05:35.949> do<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.160> octave

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.440 

definitely<00:05:40.100> go<00:05:40.250> for<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.550> makes<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.210> sound<00:05:41.330> a

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
definitely go for it makes it sound a

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.420 
definitely go for it makes it sound a
lot<00:05:41.600> cooler

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.840 

all<00:05:48.430> right<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.790> after<00:05:49.450> this<00:05:49.600> I<00:05:49.840> will<00:05:50.230> go<00:05:50.530> over

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
all right and after this I will go over

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.910 
all right and after this I will go over
the<00:05:51.850> bridge<00:05:52.270> which<00:05:53.110> then<00:05:53.350> goes<00:05:53.590> into<00:05:53.770> the

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
the bridge which then goes into the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.250 
the bridge which then goes into the
final<00:05:54.100> course<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.940> yeah<00:05:55.480> I<00:05:55.690> love<00:05:55.840> gone<00:05:56.050> over

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
final course and yeah I love gone over

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.660 
final course and yeah I love gone over

all the different parts of the song so I
hope<00:05:58.030> this<00:05:58.180> is<00:05:58.360> helping<00:05:58.630> so<00:05:58.870> far
