00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
is overall a very aesthetically pleasing

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
is overall a very aesthetically pleasing
pedal<00:00:49.460> not<00:00:50.460> looking<00:00:50.760> against<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.449> pearls

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
pedal not looking against the the pearls

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
pedal not looking against the the pearls
but<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.590> something<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.460> love

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
but there's something for I just love

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
but there's something for I just love
the<00:00:53.820> natural<00:00:54.660> wood<00:00:54.780> feel<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.320> things<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.280> next

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the natural wood feel of things the next

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010 
the natural wood feel of things the next
thing<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.640> price<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:57.809> looking

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
thing is price when you're looking

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
thing is price when you're looking
between<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.469> two<00:00:58.739> without<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> engraving

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
between these two without the engraving

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.430 
between these two without the engraving
it's<00:01:00.090> about<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> $10<00:01:00.660> difference<00:01:01.079> between

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it's about a $10 difference between

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
it's about a $10 difference between
these<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:01.680> beaters<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.789> much<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
these two beaters which is not much to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 
these two beaters which is not much to
say<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.379> definitely<00:01:05.129> noticed<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
say because I definitely noticed a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
say because I definitely noticed a
difference<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.880> quality<00:01:06.119> between<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.020> feel

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
difference in quality between the feel

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
difference in quality between the feel
of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:07.560> pedals<00:01:07.860> I'd<00:01:08.189> say<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of the two pedals I'd say it's not a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
of the two pedals I'd say it's not a
noticeable<00:01:10.740> difference<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
noticeable difference which i think is a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.980 
noticeable difference which i think is a
good<00:01:11.939> thing<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.659> good<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
good thing I think it's good for this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
good thing I think it's good for this
because<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:13.619> guys<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> small<00:01:14.250> company

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
because these guys are a small company

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
because these guys are a small company
and<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> beater<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.330> feels<00:01:15.750> really

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and to have a beater that feels really

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
and to have a beater that feels really
awkward<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.040> pedal<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.729> difficult

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
awkward on the pedal and it's difficult

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.219 
awkward on the pedal and it's difficult
to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.210> used<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.630> you're<00:01:18.750> coming<00:01:19.080> from

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to get used to when you're coming from

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
to get used to when you're coming from
something<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> CW

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
something like this or one of the CW

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
something like this or one of the CW
pedals<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.350> any<00:01:22.590> normal<00:01:22.920> pedal<00:01:23.280> that's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
pedals or any normal pedal that's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.340 
pedals or any normal pedal that's
definitely<00:01:24.240> downside<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.049> felt

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
definitely downside but this felt

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
definitely downside but this felt
completely<00:01:25.619> natural<00:01:26.009> through<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> kick

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
completely natural through on the kick

these<00:02:13.650> lowboys<00:02:14.550> definitely<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.480> lot<00:02:15.720> more

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
these lowboys definitely have a lot more

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
these lowboys definitely have a lot more

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
high end there's something I noticed a

high end there's something I noticed a
lot<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.800> fell<00:02:20.010> peers<00:02:20.310> tend<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.850> struggle<00:02:21.300> with

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
lot of fell peers tend to struggle with

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.410 
lot of fell peers tend to struggle with
and<00:02:21.890> for<00:02:22.890> me<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.280> nice<00:02:23.490> because<00:02:23.790> especially

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and for me it's nice because especially

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.990 
and for me it's nice because especially
since<00:02:24.840> I'm<00:02:24.959> doing<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> lot<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.410> work<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.709> audio

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
since I'm doing a lot of work in audio

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
since I'm doing a lot of work in audio
it<00:02:27.000> makes<00:02:27.240> T<00:02:27.990> cube<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> whole<00:02:28.560> process

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
it makes T cube the whole process

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.830 
it makes T cube the whole process
afterwards<00:02:29.640> easier<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.180> recording<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
afterwards easier just recording it and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.180 
afterwards easier just recording it and
it's<00:02:31.050> not<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.230> I'm<00:02:31.319> having<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.650> carve<00:02:32.040> out

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
it's not like I'm having to carve out

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's not like I'm having to carve out
the<00:02:32.340> boxiness<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.209> try<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.959> make<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the boxiness and then try to make the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.570 
the boxiness and then try to make the
kick-drum<00:02:34.470> shine<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.069> just<00:02:35.100> kind<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.400> comes

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
kick-drum shine it just kind of comes

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
kick-drum shine it just kind of comes
naturally<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.180> makes<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> process<00:02:36.810> very

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
naturally which makes the process very

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.910 
naturally which makes the process very
nice<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.220> me<00:02:38.310> beside<00:02:39.410> kills<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.620> rock
