this<00:01:54.460> time<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.909> year<00:01:55.119> pine<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.630> really<00:01:55.929> easy<00:01:56.200> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
this time of year pine is really easy to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.620 
this time of year pine is really easy to
find<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:57.070> then<00:01:57.460> time<00:01:57.789> if<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.210> have<00:01:58.390> old

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
find and then time if you have old

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.690 
find and then time if you have old
seasonings<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.350> are<00:01:59.710> maybe<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.280> you're<00:02:00.460> old

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
seasonings that are maybe if you're old

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.430 
seasonings that are maybe if you're old
they<00:02:00.940> don't<00:02:01.090> taste<00:02:01.360> as<00:02:01.569> good<00:02:01.720> but<00:02:01.960> they<00:02:02.080> still

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
they don't taste as good but they still

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.960 
they don't taste as good but they still
really<00:02:02.740> smell<00:02:03.009> good<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:03.429> this<00:02:03.580> is<00:02:03.729> another

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
really smell good so this is another

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.450 
really smell good so this is another
really<00:02:04.179> good<00:02:04.390> way<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.600> reuse<00:02:05.250> something<00:02:06.250> that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
really good way to reuse something that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.920 
really good way to reuse something that
you<00:02:06.579> have<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.790> really<00:02:07.090> good<00:02:07.240> idea<00:02:07.390> because<00:02:07.810> we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you have a really good idea because we

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.569 
you have a really good idea because we
all<00:02:08.049> have<00:02:08.229> old<00:02:08.350> spices<00:02:08.829> in<00:02:08.950> our<00:02:09.040> pantries<00:02:09.549> that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
all have old spices in our pantries that

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.789 
all have old spices in our pantries that
need<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.179> thrown<00:02:10.450> out<00:02:10.630> but<00:02:10.869> why<00:02:11.230> not<00:02:11.410> put

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
need to be thrown out but why not put

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.289 
need to be thrown out but why not put
them<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.100> use<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.489> this<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.910> thought<00:02:13.180> you'd

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
them to use like this I thought you'd

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.729 
them to use like this I thought you'd
never<00:02:13.450> know<00:02:13.660> what<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.049> with<00:02:14.200> an<00:02:14.290> old<00:02:14.380> spice

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
never know what to do with an old spice

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.590 
never know what to do with an old spice
but<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> perfect<00:02:15.790> way<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.940> keep<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
but this is a perfect way to keep it and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690 
but this is a perfect way to keep it and
not<00:02:16.989> have<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.260> waste<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.250> want<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.549> have

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
not have to waste it so you want to have

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.370 
not have to waste it so you want to have
all<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.000> these<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.269> heat<00:02:19.600> but<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.079> a<00:02:20.110> little

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
all of these on heat but for a little

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.539 
all of these on heat but for a little
bit<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.650> then<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.829> can<00:02:20.980> remove<00:02:21.250> them<00:02:21.430> from

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
bit and then you can remove them from

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.280 
bit and then you can remove them from
the<00:02:21.700> heat<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.480> actually<00:02:22.750> would<00:02:23.079> put

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the heat you can I actually would put

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.750 
the heat you can I actually would put
these<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.650> microwave<00:02:23.799> for<00:02:24.160> about<00:02:24.459> two

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
these in the microwave for about two

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.280 
these in the microwave for about two
minutes<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.450> get<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.720> started<00:02:26.170> before

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
minutes just to get it started before

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.780 
minutes just to get it started before
you<00:02:26.530> put<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.769> in<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> crock-pot<00:02:27.250> because<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you put it in the crock-pot because it

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
you put it in the crock-pot because it
takes<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.090> while<00:02:28.269> before<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.720> starts<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.110> really

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
takes a while before it starts to really

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
takes a while before it starts to really
heat<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.579> would<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:30.880> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
heat up with this one I would do the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.940 
heat up with this one I would do the
same<00:02:31.030> thing<00:02:31.239> maybe<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> microwave<00:02:32.769> for

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
same thing maybe in the microwave for

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.350 
same thing maybe in the microwave for
two<00:02:33.130> minutes<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.549> then<00:02:33.670> put<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> mug

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
two minutes and then put it on the mug

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.020 
two minutes and then put it on the mug
warmer<00:02:34.780> but<00:02:35.410> both<00:02:35.560> these<00:02:35.829> ways<00:02:36.100> will<00:02:36.640> send<00:02:36.940> at

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
warmer but both these ways will send at

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.550 
warmer but both these ways will send at
least<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.630> two<00:02:37.660> rooms<00:02:38.079> in<00:02:38.230> your<00:02:38.260> home
