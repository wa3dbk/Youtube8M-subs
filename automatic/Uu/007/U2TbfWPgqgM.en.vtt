00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.140 
them they're helping each other out with
assists<00:03:41.040> at<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.280> same<00:03:41.459> time<00:03:41.670> helping<00:03:42.000> our

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
assists at the same time helping our

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.680 
assists at the same time helping our
team<00:03:42.420> out<00:03:43.910> another<00:03:44.910> reason<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.390> why<00:03:45.480> this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
team out another reason as to why this

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.690 
team out another reason as to why this
is<00:03:46.019> such<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> good<00:03:46.349> vantage<00:03:46.560> point<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:47.370> because

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
is such a good vantage point is because

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.550 
is such a good vantage point is because
if<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:47.940> gets<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.180> bit<00:03:48.299> choppy<00:03:48.540> or<00:03:48.810> enemies

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
if it gets a bit choppy or enemies

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.690 
if it gets a bit choppy or enemies
notice<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:49.920> you're<00:03:50.040> up<00:03:50.160> here<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.519> start

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
notice that you're up here and start

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.160 
notice that you're up here and start
shooting<00:03:50.880> back<00:03:51.120> at<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.780> go<00:03:51.900> ahead<00:03:52.049> and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
shooting back at you you go ahead and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.440 
shooting back at you you go ahead and
sit<00:03:52.290> by<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.470> across<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.920> next<00:03:53.160> building

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
sit by and across to the next building

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.250 
sit by and across to the next building
and<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:55.860> basically<00:03:56.959> get<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.079> drop

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and then you can basically get the drop

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.720 
and then you can basically get the drop
on<00:03:58.290> them<00:03:58.440> from<00:03:58.620> from<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.340> different<00:03:59.489> angle

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
on them from from a different angle

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.610 
on them from from a different angle
which<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.030> great<00:04:00.329> because<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.049> never<00:04:01.260> expect

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
which is great because I never expect

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.530 
which is great because I never expect
that<00:04:01.680> really<00:04:01.980> something<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.060> would<00:04:03.209> say<00:04:03.390> is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
that really something I would say is

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.569 
that really something I would say is
though<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.410> careful<00:04:04.560> with<00:04:04.799> your<00:04:04.860> shots<00:04:05.130> so

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
though is be careful with your shots so

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.309 
though is be careful with your shots so
what<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.730> mean<00:04:05.880> by<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.269> don't<00:04:06.690> sort<00:04:07.200> of

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
what I mean by that is don't sort of

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.020 
what I mean by that is don't sort of
repeatedly<00:04:07.920> shoot<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.310> know<00:04:08.400> one<00:04:08.700> bill<00:04:08.880> after

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
repeatedly shoot you know one bill after

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.479 
repeatedly shoot you know one bill after

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.009 
you can see these guys are busy shooting
at<00:04:20.639> my<00:04:20.700> teammate<00:04:21.090> or<00:04:21.269> on<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.540> other<00:04:21.690> building

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
at my teammate or on the other building

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.750 
at my teammate or on the other building
whilst<00:04:22.770> I'm<00:04:22.919> sitting<00:04:23.220> there<00:04:23.310> getting<00:04:23.460> clean

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
whilst I'm sitting there getting clean

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.980 
whilst I'm sitting there getting clean
shots<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.180> picking<00:04:24.419> off<00:04:24.479> enemies<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
shots and picking off enemies in the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.140 
shots and picking off enemies in the
process<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.580> really<00:04:26.789> really<00:04:26.910> good

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
process so it's a really really good

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.420 
process so it's a really really good
vantage<00:04:27.479> point<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.500> great<00:04:28.800> angle<00:04:29.160> as<00:04:29.250> well

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
vantage point it's a great angle as well

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.460 
vantage point it's a great angle as well
because<00:04:29.910> enemies<00:04:30.389> will<00:04:30.510> never<00:04:30.690> expect<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.320> if

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
because enemies will never expect it if
