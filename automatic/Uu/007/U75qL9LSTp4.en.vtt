00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.190
 how about friends we drink tv.com we are 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.150
 with the reinforcement of the pachuca team 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.460
 for this closing 2014 alex colon alex 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.120
 colon of ecuador for pachuca alex how 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.340
 you are very good 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.710
 he is very happy for the good triumph 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.780
 but that is left behind now comes a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.370
 great level like back and you have to think 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.710
 one hundred percent before the others 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.570
 álex surprised everyone when that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 great performance they beat the champion of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.310
 Mexican football was passed over and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 good a good 3 to 1 good I do not think 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.559
 that was left on the day of departure now 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.900
 we are thinking that live atlases and I think 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.300
 that things have been giving the best way 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.580
 and God want to continue like this not to have 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.350
 Valencia to the former colony also comes 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.510
 came down and little by little the reinforcements 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.460
 they start to make weight in this team 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.080
 pachuca and little by little I think that one 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.239
 I was doing the best things 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.280
 way from the beginning but good not 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.080
 would the results are now giving 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.150
 and I think that also the fight has not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.400
 meaning in Mexican soccer the others 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 first games you've had here and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.909
 yes I think very well you have the same 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.980
 to see that one was very good 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.110
 shown very well thank god when 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.300
 things slowly and step by step I 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.310
 has not surprised how you play in 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.290
 mexico in the speed that is what we 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.840
 is surprised because I think the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.460
 quickly do not leave you many spaces and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.870
 the spaces that leave you this 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.180
 make the most of it because 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.860
 and there does not say that the goals take away a lot 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.830
 your pressure put the first one with the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.350
 pachuca and I think that apart from that the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.690
 pressure is always in the new 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.000
 goals you always have to be good 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.930
 and always 100% begins to sound your 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 first name 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.040
 people start to recognize you 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280

 what are you having on the court itself? 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.410
 well apart from being a person ever 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.050
 they denied an autograph a photo to a child 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.150
 that is the cutest thing I do not think they 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.010
