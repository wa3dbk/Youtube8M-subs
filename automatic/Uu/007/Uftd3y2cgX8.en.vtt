 very good I'm nico from apple maniacs 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.530
 point is and in this video we are going to 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.040
 explain how to reset the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.780
 samsung galaxy note 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.960
 we will explain it through two 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.610
 methods if we can access the menu and in 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.980
 case that we can not through a 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.689
 key combination remember that with 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.599
 this method erases all data 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.480
 of the device we are going to let you also 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 in the forum in the android section the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.640
 written tutorial so we started 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.060
 first let's check the version of 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.580
 Android that has the Samsung Galaxy Note 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 we go into about within adjustments 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.530
 and we see that it has version 2.3 points 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.649
 6 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.430
 we go back and enter 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.430
 Privacy 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.090
 reestablish factory data and if 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.130
 we want to erase the sd memory we mark 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.979
 this box that you see here we do not click 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.950
 in reset phone and finally 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.479
 delete all the second method would be to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.030
 through a combination of keys 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.310
 holding the up arrow keys 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.979
 the volume and the one below the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.070
 center screen and we keep pressed 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.250
 the power button until it appears 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.170
 samsung let's wait with the others 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.800
 two keys pressed until you see 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.090
 the android icon and let's go now 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.090
 we go down to where you put wave dates 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.580
 factory reset and press the button 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.440
 below the screen 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.440
 central to confirm 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.280
 then we go down with the button to lower the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.060
 volume far put yes and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.689
 We confirm with the button below 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.290
 we wait for the hard 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.619
 reset and finally click on king 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.460
 but system now with the button below 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.460
 we confirm 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.220
 and we wait for it to turn on and now 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.989
 we would have ready as you see is very 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.180
