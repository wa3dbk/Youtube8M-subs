00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 just to feed these 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.429

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.710

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:36.280
 where these animals are is 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.210
 floors that adjoins a center 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.109

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.200

 how much good afternoon what we 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.060

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.040
 well actually we eat like you 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.620
 I was commenting a while ago we have been helping 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.270
 to Mrs. vicky collecting donation 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.210
 for meals doing jobs 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.920
 cleaning we do it weekly from 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 according to the hostels that we go 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.360
 visiting just like two weeks ago not 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.950
 we come to support Mrs. vicky we 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.060
 we found with this picture a little 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.690
 difficult the puppies were without food 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.520
 They were 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.770
 the skinny we have come 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.770
 bringing food for them has 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.090
 shocked a lot the death of the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.410
 Mrs. Vicky as a person 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.330
 completely healthy an older lady 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.040
 really never told us not in the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.750
 theme of helping animals and how you see 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.750
 that they really are not 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.400
 the lady here had many more friends 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.350
 topics of the organizations we 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.240
 we did weekly collections and 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.180
 we brought approximately all three 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.860
 sacks equally the same shelter has 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.380
 an aid group that is also 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.690
 I was in charge of collecting food and doing 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.180
 activities we also do mini fairs 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.120
 weekly fairs right here in a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.070
 Breña market we sell things food and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.360
 we bought food with the 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.120
 ladies only now feeds 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.100
 donations we are observing this is the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.100
 state that the lady had the poor 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.980
 old a little dirty the atmosphere in 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.240
 actually this way I had had 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.820
 these animals and even so actually the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.420
 most times this shelter was 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.910
 it's clean, not a day goes by, one leaves 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.890
 to clean up this hostel and it is already a 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.710
 disaster really not us as I say 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.120
 we have been doing the weekly help 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.340
 Just Mrs. Vicky had stayed 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.500
 alone I imagine that it will have been like this 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.260
 for several days for this to arrive 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.020
 to this state and nothing like you can see the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.810
 puppies were in adoption all 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.160
 because we have definitely had 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.450
 the notice that they are going to evict us 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 we're going to take out now and well the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.860
 that we are not going to be able to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.510
 give treatment and help so they can 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.920
 they be in adoption 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.330
 on that subject you already have the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.420
 notice that at any time the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.650
 can evacuate from here and how will it 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.780
 to be in any case 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.489
 of course we are 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.079
 finding out where we could 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.060
 where we can locate all the 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.610
 puppies we are talking about more than 50 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.159
 dogs and it's more could be more we have 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.140
 also cats then thank god 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.549
 We have also had an answer from others 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.519
 cat hostels we also have the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.549
 radio of the lady graciela of kittens 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.140
 looking for home is out here 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.909
 also supporting us from the hostel 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.680
 from karim we are all hostels 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.269
 all organizations aware of 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.400
 this case the lady saw that it was very 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.049
 known and we definitely do not go to 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.199
 leave these animals helpless alone 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.079
 We need support for donations from 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.370
 food because they really need to eat 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.110
 We also need support in the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 donations have to go out for adoption 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.699
 everyone also had problems with the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.550
 school that adjoins yes good 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.330
 unfortunately this school arrived 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.160
 after the shelter then if they had 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.349
 problems always about leaving 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.090

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.090

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.400

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.009
 of 10 years for what I know 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.349
 we have been supporting up to more or less 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.610
