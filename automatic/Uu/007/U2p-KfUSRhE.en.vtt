I thought has been great I think he's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.390 
I thought has been great I think he's
said<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.290> strong<00:02:13.560> games<00:02:13.860> or<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> think

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
said you know strong games or I think

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.820 
said you know strong games or I think
he's<00:02:14.520> been<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:15.300> control<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.650> he's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
he's been in control and you know he's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.010 
he's been in control and you know he's
he<00:02:17.700> looks<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.060> he's<00:02:18.240> confident<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
he looks like he's confident and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.990 
he looks like he's confident and
comfortable<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.580> he's<00:02:20.700> done<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.880> great

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
