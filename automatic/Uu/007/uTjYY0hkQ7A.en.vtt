00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
what you do is you come up through the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.270 
what you do is you come up through the
next<00:01:43.970> diamond<00:01:45.819> like<00:01:46.819> that<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.470> little<00:01:48.470> bit<00:01:48.590> and

next diamond like that a little bit and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.270 
next diamond like that a little bit and
then<00:01:49.429> you<00:01:49.520> cut<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.909> loop<00:01:50.210> right<00:01:50.420> here<00:01:51.280> and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
then you cut this loop right here and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:14.880 
then you cut this loop right here and
then<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.149> pull<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.600> right<00:01:54.530> through<00:01:55.039> there
