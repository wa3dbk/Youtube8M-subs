00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.980
 I hope you are great today we are going to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 talk about patterned skirts and 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.309
 we can also apply it to skirts 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 smooth but you know that this season 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.150
 come with a lot of force from the skirts 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.650
 with prints I'm going to give you seven ideas 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.570
 of how to combine them is truly 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 we face days that we did and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 how can I combine them, you'll see 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 seven keys that although the seven can 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 that do not apply to that particular skirt 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 stamped that you have sure that some 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 of those keys works for you we're going to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.849
 start and see how easy they are 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.849
 to combine 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 This is the skirt I'm going to make 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.020
 the combinations as you see is a skirt 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.059
 which is asymmetric is a little bit more 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.370
 short in front and a little longer 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 behind and has three shades 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.449
 main or four shades 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.370
 main ones are the blue the black 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.510
 grayish and white the first 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 suggestion that I do to you is that what 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.860
 combine with the color black you can 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 choose a light shirt in black 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 at the same time as sandals 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.409
 also in black color and to give it a 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.300
 touch more colorful in this case you 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.510
 decided to put a pink plus 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510
 fuchsia 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 another possibility that never fails is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.260
 combine patterned skirts with 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.630
 white in this case chosen a shirt 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
 white a white blouse and short sleeves 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 Since we're already in summer, it's more 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 heat and it's good to be cool 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.270
 the white also in a patterned skirt 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.590
 help a little to lower the set 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 because the prints are sometimes very 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.619
 charged then with the white 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.950
 get also lower a bit of the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.950
 tone 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.270
 an option that never fails and that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.740
 love to combine with skirts over 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.140
 All pencil style are t-shirts 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.870
 smooth flat in also smooth colors 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.670
 as the white and the black color a 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.740
 fourth possibility is that you combine it with 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.540
 top parts that have some color 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.580
 of which incorporates is stamped the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.800
 skirt as I said in this case my 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.480
 skirt has black white blue and gray 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.070
 not in black and white we have already seen how 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.170
 combines but for example we could opt 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.030
 by different shades of blue or 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.710
 even gray shirts or shirts 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.360
 grays in this same line also 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.040
 you can combine the skirt with some color 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.720
 complementary is to say here there is a 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.280
 lost dominance of the blue color 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.960
 a complementary color the blue is the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 orange color why you have chosen 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.740
 accessories in orange in the same way 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.330
 I could have used a shirt 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.160
 orange or an orange shirt but 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.630
 agrees that he did not have and that's why 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.250
 I wanted to do the demonstration with some 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.990
 accessories of that color a fifth 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.520
 way to combine patterned skirts is 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.470
 do it with shirts that have 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.420
 there are thousands of thousand 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.770
 colors I have chosen in a beige color by 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.510
 what I have told you to follow the 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.370
 tonalities that come with one's own 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.380
 skirt and so have a little 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.330
 message that you want to highlight in the part 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.220
 in front is this place the houses 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.080
 just like the drumsticks are a kind of 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.850
 clothes that generally go very well in 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.470
 any look the leather jacket 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.030
 also always adds a tougher touch 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.950
 to the look and specifically I like it very much 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.630
 with these types of skirts and finally my 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.730
 seventh suggestion is that you combine it 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.560
 with fluorine colors but pastel is not 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.750
 say as floral but a little bit past 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
 in excessively striking fluorine but 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.980
 a fluoride as we say passed by water 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.470
 these kinds of colors are already pink in a 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.480
 green color in an orange color works 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.980
 phenomenal with skirts are fenced vais 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.900
 to see and until we have arrived with 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.190
 these seven ideas or suggestions so that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.320
 combine our patterned skirts 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.940
 during this summer I hope you are 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.080
 very pretty with them and see you in the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.080
 next video until next time
