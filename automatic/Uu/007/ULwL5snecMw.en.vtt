terry cloth elasticized on each side and
it's<00:00:46.390> got<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.690> wider<00:00:47.140> area<00:00:47.350> here<00:00:48.340> as<00:00:49.090> you<00:00:49.270> can

the<00:00:53.290> reason<00:00:53.710> being<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:54.190> because<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.640> sort<00:00:54.910> of

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
the reason being is because it sort of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.229 
the reason being is because it sort of
serves<00:00:55.300> as<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> pocket<00:00:55.960> for<00:00:56.470> your<00:00:56.530> hair<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.850> it
