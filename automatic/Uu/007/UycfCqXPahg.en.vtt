finally the self diagnostic device will
Beach<00:05:03.320> will<00:05:04.190> check<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.540> bike<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.200> display<00:05:06.800> an

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
Beach will check the bike and display an

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.340 
Beach will check the bike and display an
error<00:05:07.070> code<00:05:07.550> right<00:05:08.030> next<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.750> trip<00:05:09.020> one

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.480 

now<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.410> handlebar<00:05:14.169> switch<00:05:15.340> switches<00:05:16.340> are

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
now the handlebar switch switches are

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.990 
now the handlebar switch switches are
basic<00:05:17.110> but<00:05:18.110> little<00:05:18.590> changes<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.610> info

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
basic but little changes like the info

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.020 
basic but little changes like the info
button<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:21.610> all<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.880> is<00:05:23.060> pretty<00:05:23.360> much<00:05:23.450> basic

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
button so all this is pretty much basic

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.350 

and<00:05:26.480> it<00:05:26.780> was<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:26.990> only<00:05:27.110> change<00:05:27.470> pretty<00:05:27.710> much

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
and it was the only change pretty much

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.750 
and it was the only change pretty much
so<00:05:29.360> whenever<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.930> press<00:05:30.170> this<00:05:30.670> let's<00:05:31.670> change

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
so whenever I press this let's change

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.610 
so whenever I press this let's change
this<00:05:32.060> right<00:05:32.240> here<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:37.190> other<00:05:37.310> thing<00:05:37.640> is<00:05:37.820> if

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
this right here the other thing is if

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.000 
this right here the other thing is if
even<00:05:39.620> if<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.860> bike<00:05:40.010> is<00:05:40.040> new<00:05:40.520> or<00:05:40.790> used<00:05:41.860> this<00:05:42.860> is

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
even if the bike is new or used this is

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:51.300 
even if the bike is new or used this is

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.630 

whenever<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.760> reaches<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:54.620> second<00:05:55.160> bar<00:05:55.340> from

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640
