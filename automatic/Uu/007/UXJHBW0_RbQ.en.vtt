00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
point trying to be something else

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.600 
point trying to be something else
because<00:05:38.479> really<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:40.100> know<00:05:40.190> people<00:05:40.460> see

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
like the world that I was in this

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.980 
like the world that I was in this
amazing<00:06:24.380> world<00:06:24.910> you<00:06:25.910> know<00:06:26.030> at<00:06:26.150> all<00:06:26.300> it<00:06:26.600> didn't

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
amazing world you know at all it didn't

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.900

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
make a difference at all like what I was

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.430 
make a difference at all like what I was
doing<00:06:29.270> even<00:06:29.720> though<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:29.930> know<00:06:30.200> I'm<00:06:30.290> quite

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
doing even though you know I'm quite

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.520 
doing even though you know I'm quite
proud<00:06:30.770> of<00:06:31.040> where<00:06:31.490> I've<00:06:31.580> got<00:06:31.730> to<00:06:31.850> in<00:06:31.970> life<00:06:32.120> but

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
proud of where I've got to in life but

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.650 
proud of where I've got to in life but
it<00:06:33.530> just<00:06:33.770> it<00:06:33.980> was<00:06:34.130> just<00:06:34.400> you<00:06:34.970> know<00:06:35.000> a<00:06:35.120> moment<00:06:35.570> of

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
it just it was just you know a moment of

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.090 
it just it was just you know a moment of
complete<00:06:35.990> clarity<00:06:36.500> where<00:06:36.830> I<00:06:36.860> thought

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
complete clarity where I thought

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.600 
complete clarity where I thought
actually<00:06:37.690> there's<00:06:38.690> more<00:06:38.780> to<00:06:39.230> this<00:06:39.350> world<00:06:39.610> and

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
actually there's more to this world and

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.040 
actually there's more to this world and
I<00:06:40.730> think<00:06:40.940> that's<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.330> true<00:06:41.600> measure<00:06:41.840> of

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
I think that's the true measure of

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.440 
I think that's the true measure of
success<00:06:42.260> in<00:06:42.680> realizing<00:06:43.340> that<00:06:43.490> once<00:06:44.180> you<00:06:44.300> get

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
success in realizing that once you get

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.210 
success in realizing that once you get
to<00:06:44.510> a<00:06:44.660> point<00:06:44.930> it's<00:06:45.290> actually<00:06:45.440> about<00:06:45.860> giving

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
to a point it's actually about giving

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.270 
to a point it's actually about giving
back<00:06:46.400> to<00:06:47.150> other<00:06:47.330> people<00:06:47.810> and<00:06:48.050> you<00:06:49.010> know<00:06:49.040> that's

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
back to other people and you know that's

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.980 
back to other people and you know that's
