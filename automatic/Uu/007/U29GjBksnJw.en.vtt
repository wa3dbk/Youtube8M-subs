00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
a hoop that is a 120 by 120 hoop so that

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.670 
a hoop that is a 120 by 120 hoop so that
is<00:01:50.799> actually<00:01:51.310> your<00:01:51.850> regular<00:01:52.330> sized<00:01:52.960> hoop<00:01:53.439> what

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
is actually your regular sized hoop what

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.320 
is actually your regular sized hoop what
I<00:01:53.710> call<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.159> kind<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.369> more<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.670> medium<00:01:55.060> sized

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
I call it kind of more of a medium sized

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.390 
I call it kind of more of a medium sized
hoop<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:56.049> since<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.409> have<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> larger<00:01:57.040> hoop<00:01:57.220> on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
hoop but since I have the larger hoop on

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.399 
hoop but since I have the larger hoop on
I'm<00:01:57.820> gonna<00:01:58.030> need<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.360> tell<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.810> Machine<00:01:59.170> I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
I'm gonna need to tell the Machine I

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.499 
I'm gonna need to tell the Machine I
have<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> larger<00:02:00.460> hoop<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.939> touch<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.360> hoop

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
have a larger hoop so touch the hoop

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.320 
have a larger hoop so touch the hoop
template<00:02:02.020> or<00:02:02.200> hoop<00:02:02.920> area<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.520> scroll<00:02:04.119> up<00:02:04.150> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
template or hoop area and scroll up to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.210 
template or hoop area and scroll up to
the<00:02:04.509> top<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.080> largest<00:02:05.409> hoop<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:05.979> it's<00:02:06.100> at

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
the top it's the largest hoop so it's at

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.800 
the top it's the largest hoop so it's at
the<00:02:06.340> top<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.759> list<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.570> will<00:02:07.600> actually

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
the top of the list and it will actually

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.529 
the top of the list and it will actually
give<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> bigger<00:02:08.679> playground<00:02:09.669> and<00:02:10.149> show

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
give you a bigger playground and show

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.769 
give you a bigger playground and show
you<00:02:10.599> for<00:02:10.959> example<00:02:10.989> how<00:02:11.980> big<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.549> frog<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.299> so

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:13.779 
you for example how big this frog is so

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.250 
you for example how big this frog is so
then<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.379> go<00:02:14.529> ahead<00:02:14.620> we'll

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
then we can go ahead we'll

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.259 
then we can go ahead we'll
get<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.709> show<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:15.920> how<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.159> move<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.879> frog

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
get to show you how to move the frog

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.949 
get to show you how to move the frog
around<00:02:17.950> bring<00:02:18.950> letters<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.670> combine<00:02:20.330> them<00:02:20.690> and

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
around bring letters in combine them and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.530 
around bring letters in combine them and
if<00:02:21.860> when<00:02:22.159> you're<00:02:22.310> done<00:02:22.519> all<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.360> do

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
if when you're done all you have to do

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.750 
if when you're done all you have to do
is<00:02:23.720> touch<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.200> trash<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> trash<00:02:25.549> can

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
is touch the trash can so the trash can

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.940 
is touch the trash can so the trash can
will<00:02:25.909> delete<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.450> up<00:02:26.629> it's<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.290> deleting<00:02:27.830> it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
will delete that up it's not deleting it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.949 
will delete that up it's not deleting it
from<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.610> machine<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.360> leading<00:02:29.690> it

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
from the machine it's just leading it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.410 
from the machine it's just leading it
off<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.440> work<00:02:30.709> area<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.910> if<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.120> went<00:02:32.330> ahead

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
off the work area so if we went ahead

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.660 
off the work area so if we went ahead
and<00:02:32.599> went<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.200> another<00:02:33.709> design<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:34.580> example

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and went to another design for example

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.150 
and went to another design for example
the<00:02:35.120> heart<00:02:35.330> here<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.959> will<00:02:36.410> bring<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.739> in<00:02:36.890> we've

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
the heart here it will bring it in we've

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.650 
the heart here it will bring it in we've
told<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.519> which<00:02:37.700> hoop<00:02:37.879> we're<00:02:38.060> using<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:38.569> it

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
told it which hoop we're using so it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.280 
told it which hoop we're using so it
still<00:02:38.930> keeps<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.410> area<00:02:39.769> we<00:02:40.280> can<00:02:40.489> zoom<00:02:40.730> in<00:02:41.290> if

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
still keeps that area we can zoom in if

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.410 
still keeps that area we can zoom in if
you<00:02:42.440> want<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.709> see<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.519> you're<00:02:43.700> doing<00:02:44.060> again

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
you want to see what you're doing again

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.710 
you want to see what you're doing again
if<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.110> box<00:02:45.409> is<00:02:45.620> around<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:47.599> not

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
if a box is around it and if it's not

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.420 
if a box is around it and if it's not
you<00:02:47.989> can<00:02:48.170> touch<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.769> box<00:02:48.980> will<00:02:49.250> appear

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you can touch it in a box will appear

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.430 
you can touch it in a box will appear
and<00:02:49.940> then<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.510> can<00:02:50.660> move<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.989> side<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.260> side

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
and then we can move it side to side

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.410 
and then we can move it side to side
kind<00:02:51.829> of<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.980> nice<00:02:52.160> touch<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.730> drag<00:02:52.910> type

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
kind of a nice touch and drag type

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.800 
kind of a nice touch and drag type
option<00:02:54.079> here<00:02:54.349> so<00:02:54.890> we<00:02:55.430> will<00:02:55.609> be<00:02:55.730> able<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.269> do<00:02:56.450> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
option here so we will be able to do so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.839 
option here so we will be able to do so
many<00:02:56.959> things<00:02:57.109> with<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.680> machine<00:02:58.099> but<00:02:58.519> this

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
many things with this machine but this

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.390 
many things with this machine but this
is<00:02:59.090> how<00:02:59.299> easy<00:02:59.569> it<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.079> do<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.530> when<00:03:01.250> you're

to the top left corner the top right
corner<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:30.230> bottom<00:03:30.680> right<00:03:30.859> corner<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
corner the bottom right corner the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
bottom left corner and back to Center so

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.670 
bottom left corner and back to Center so
if<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.180> want<00:03:35.389> to<00:03:35.480> Center<00:03:35.810> this<00:03:35.989> design<00:03:36.380> on<00:03:36.620> my

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
if I want to Center this design on my

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.819 
if I want to Center this design on my
hoop<00:03:37.310> what<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:37.669> can<00:03:37.910> do<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.389> go<00:03:38.599> ahead<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.959> move

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
hoop what I can do is go ahead and move

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.490 
hoop what I can do is go ahead and move
the<00:03:40.130> center<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.849> design<00:03:41.169> notice<00:03:42.169> as<00:03:42.349> I

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
the center of the design notice as I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.490 
the center of the design notice as I
hold<00:03:42.859> this<00:03:43.250> it's<00:03:43.910> moving<00:03:44.480> my<00:03:44.630> needle<00:03:45.049> all<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
hold this it's moving my needle all the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.589 
hold this it's moving my needle all the
way<00:03:45.650> up<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:46.280> then<00:03:46.940> I'm<00:03:47.030> gonna<00:03:47.120> move<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.389> over

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
way up and then I'm gonna move it over

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.530 
way up and then I'm gonna move it over
here<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.019> side<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> little<00:03:48.470> bit<00:03:49.090> very<00:03:50.090> small

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
here to the side a little bit very small

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.110 
here to the side a little bit very small
increments<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> more<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.739> hold<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
increments so the more you hold this the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.210 
increments so the more you hold this the
more<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.840> moves<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.500> I'm<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:54.889> gonna<00:03:54.980> get

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
more that moves so I'm just gonna get

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280 
more that moves so I'm just gonna get
this<00:03:55.340> really<00:03:55.669> well<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.359> pretty<00:03:56.690> close<00:03:56.959> so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
this really well that's pretty close so

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.199 
this really well that's pretty close so
once<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:57.829> have<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.040> where<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.310> want<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.849> be<00:03:59.000> if

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
once I have it where I want it to be if

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.300 
once I have it where I want it to be if
I<00:03:59.359> want<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.629> trace<00:03:59.959> around<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.590> one<00:04:00.799> more<00:04:01.010> time

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
I want to trace around it one more time

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.190 
I want to trace around it one more time
and<00:04:01.669> just<00:04:01.730> make<00:04:02.389> sure<00:04:02.419> I'm<00:04:02.720> not<00:04:02.780> stitching

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
and just make sure I'm not stitching

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.839 
and just make sure I'm not stitching
over<00:04:03.590> something<00:04:03.950> I'm<00:04:04.040> not<00:04:04.250> supposed<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.669> be

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
over something I'm not supposed to be

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.699 
over something I'm not supposed to be
stitching<00:04:05.120> that's<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.930> great<00:04:06.109> way<00:04:06.260> we<00:04:06.290> will

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
stitching that's a great way we will

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.409 
stitching that's a great way we will
come<00:04:06.919> back<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.400> design<00:04:07.700> positioning<00:04:08.269> and

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
come back to the design positioning and

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.240 
come back to the design positioning and
show<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:08.930> more<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.410> once<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.099> get

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
show you more of that once you get

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.520 
show you more of that once you get
started<00:04:10.700> now<00:04:11.120> this<00:04:11.299> is<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.510> one<00:04:11.810> color<00:04:12.079> design

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
going to find is a lot of designs have

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210 
going to find is a lot of designs have
what<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:39.990> call<00:04:40.200> underlay<00:04:40.740> stitching

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
what we call underlay stitching

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.100 
what we call underlay stitching
stitching<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.970> goes<00:04:42.030> down<00:04:42.300> first<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.930> kind

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
stitching that goes down first to kind

stitching that goes down first to kind
of<00:04:43.140> connect<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.530> fabric<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> stabilizer

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
of connect the fabric to the stabilizer

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.450 
of connect the fabric to the stabilizer
and<00:04:45.270> also<00:04:45.870> give<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.290> design<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.860> little<00:04:47.280> bit

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
and also give the design a little bit

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.660 
and also give the design a little bit
more<00:04:47.880> body<00:04:48.810> as<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.560> stitches<00:04:49.800> over<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.490> so

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
more body as it stitches over this so

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.760 
more body as it stitches over this so
it's<00:04:50.790> really<00:04:51.060> kind<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.450> neat<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.900> still<00:04:52.290> sit<00:04:52.620> and

having<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.700> be<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> smaller<00:05:09.210> number<00:05:09.480> you'll<00:05:09.780> get

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
having it be a smaller number you'll get

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.230 
having it be a smaller number you'll get
more<00:05:10.110> threads<00:05:10.470> pulled<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.070> backside<00:05:11.280> so

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
more threads pulled to the backside so

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.790 
more threads pulled to the backside so
you<00:05:12.330> definitely<00:05:12.540> don't<00:05:12.990> want<00:05:13.200> any<00:05:13.470> white

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
you definitely don't want any white

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.340 
you definitely don't want any white
thread<00:05:14.190> or<00:05:14.400> bobbin<00:05:14.790> thread<00:05:15.090> coming<00:05:15.960> up<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.230> the

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
thread or bobbin thread coming up to the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.990 
thread or bobbin thread coming up to the
top<00:05:16.560> bobbin<00:05:16.950> thread<00:05:17.130> we<00:05:17.220> usually<00:05:17.520> use<00:05:17.640> white

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
top bobbin thread we usually use white

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.780 
top bobbin thread we usually use white
and<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:18.810> it's<00:05:19.230> sometimes<00:05:19.740> does<00:05:20.160> show<00:05:20.370> on<00:05:20.550> maybe

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
and so it's sometimes does show on maybe

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.730 
and so it's sometimes does show on maybe
your<00:05:20.970> darker<00:05:21.330> colors<00:05:21.720> if<00:05:22.020> it's<00:05:22.230> not<00:05:22.380> properly

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
your darker colors if it's not properly

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.490 
your darker colors if it's not properly
set<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:24.000> because<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.840> have<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.020> little<00:05:25.350> bit

set so because I have a little bit

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.840

got the check mark box so that means if
I<00:06:24.660> have<00:06:24.690> any<00:06:24.960> power<00:06:25.440> out<00:06:25.800> issues<00:06:26.660> then<00:06:27.660> that

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
I have any power out issues then that

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.409 
I have any power out issues then that
way<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.020> can<00:06:28.530> make<00:06:28.770> sure<00:06:28.800> that<00:06:29.010> there<00:06:29.820> isn't<00:06:30.000> a

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
way I can make sure that there isn't a

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.080 
way I can make sure that there isn't a
problem

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
problem

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.490 
problem
also<00:06:33.090> to<00:06:33.240> plug<00:06:33.510> your<00:06:33.600> machine<00:06:33.900> into<00:06:34.200> at<00:06:34.470> least

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
also to plug your machine into at least

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.409 
also to plug your machine into at least
a<00:06:34.950> surge<00:06:35.160> protector<00:06:35.190> or<00:06:35.910> better<00:06:36.120> yet<00:06:36.360> a

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
a surge protector or better yet a

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.840 
a surge protector or better yet a
battery<00:06:36.810> backup<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:37.560> that<00:06:38.039> way<00:06:38.220> your<00:06:38.550> machine

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
battery backup and that way your machine

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.670 
battery backup and that way your machine
will<00:06:39.000> just<00:06:39.180> say<00:06:39.360> healthier

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
will just say healthier

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.070 
will just say healthier
if<00:06:40.800> you<00:06:40.949> have<00:06:41.160> any<00:06:41.340> power<00:06:41.699> issues<00:06:42.449> we've

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
if you have any power issues we've

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.510 
if you have any power issues we've
noticed<00:06:43.410> that<00:06:43.500> as<00:06:43.770> we<00:06:43.949> get<00:06:44.040> big<00:06:44.280> groups

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
noticed that as we get big groups

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.640 
noticed that as we get big groups
together<00:06:44.940> that<00:06:45.509> that<00:06:45.540> really<00:06:46.050> makes<00:06:46.380> a

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
together that that really makes a

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.390 
together that that really makes a
difference
