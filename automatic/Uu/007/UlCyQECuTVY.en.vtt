00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
put spark plugs in it I just got to move

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
put spark plugs in it I just got to move
those<00:01:37.619> shock<00:01:37.860> reservoirs<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> way

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

over<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> place<00:02:10.879> but<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.940> never<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.300> when

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
over the place but you never know when

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.360 
over the place but you never know when
you<00:02:12.510> might<00:02:12.629> need<00:02:12.690> an<00:02:12.900> engine<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.440> there<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> go

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you might need an engine so there you go
