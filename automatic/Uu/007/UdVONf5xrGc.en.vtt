00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.529
 because I do not hurt too much here 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.340
 if I put the whole in the area 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.109
 on walls 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.619
 please take care that he does not 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.090
 somehow big the way back or that 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.219
 somehow hikers are standing next to them 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.090
 be stoned so easy social 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.880
 environment for the flick is it then 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.809
 so the basic process that one 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.040
 before the turn once 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.100
 opposite to the wheel drifting 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.530
 lets go then if you are at the height of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.020
 curve is to open the borders and then 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.750
 just give this game the winner of the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.850
 Winemakers take this place 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.440
 the brake again completely open because 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 I'm just swinging out of the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.199
 curve can rausholen 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 my back wheel slip over this 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.539
 can of course I am taking with 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.979
 the lift impulse and if it is here then 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.590
 even here I will come here then 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.319
 Arrives then this movement finds 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.889
 actually a look and just the 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:23.079
 Dynamics The allowed head comes with 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.010
 the line this whole the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.870
 steering movements 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.870
 the whole thing looks like this 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.990
 you already have 10 that's right 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.510
 Technique where I really have the curve 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.880
 and then because of the 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.030
 Traction really has to stay on the ball 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.140
 you have to see it here too 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.330
 bypasses and retains the traction 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.290
 Shopping fun also sets up 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.540
 pile harm 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:09.310
 That's why he's looking for a clever one 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.310
