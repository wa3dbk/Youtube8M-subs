the centuries sailors have tapped the

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.129 
the centuries sailors have tapped the
free<00:00:13.400> energy<00:00:13.760> of<00:00:13.790> the<00:00:14.000> winds<00:00:14.180> to<00:00:14.719> drive<00:00:14.959> them

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
free energy of the winds to drive them

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.350 
free energy of the winds to drive them
across<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.590> oceans<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.700> now<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:16.970> ever

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
across the oceans and now the ever

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.900 
across the oceans and now the ever

energy conscious Norwegians are working

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.760 
energy conscious Norwegians are working
on<00:00:20.090> an<00:00:20.210> even<00:00:20.330> more<00:00:20.630> elegant<00:00:20.900> way<00:00:21.290> of<00:00:21.320> getting

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
on an even more elegant way of getting

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.670 
on an even more elegant way of getting
something<00:00:22.070> for<00:00:22.369> nothing<00:00:22.490> at<00:00:22.820> sea<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.300> wave

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.330 
powered ship and the rather incongruous
setting<00:00:32.000> for<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.269> new<00:00:32.480> idea<00:00:32.870> is<00:00:33.080> a<00:00:33.140> barn<00:00:33.949> in

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
setting for this new idea is a barn in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.160 
setting for this new idea is a barn in
the<00:00:34.610> middle<00:00:34.879> of<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.059> Norwegian<00:00:35.600> countryside

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120 

now<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:45.910> idea<00:00:46.450> of<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.720> wave<00:00:47.170> parvo<00:00:47.710> seems

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
now the idea of a wave parvo seems

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.710 
now the idea of a wave parvo seems
rather<00:00:48.370> too<00:00:48.640> good<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.000> be<00:00:49.120> true

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
rather too good to be true

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.470 
rather too good to be true
mrs.<00:00:50.560> Julius<00:00:50.950> who<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:51.490> see<00:00:51.730> yeah<00:00:51.970> for

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
mrs. Julius who you see yeah for

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:01.460 
mrs. Julius who you see yeah for
yourself<00:00:53.080> it's<00:00:53.350> running<00:00:53.770> by<00:00:53.950> wife<00:00:54.190> all<00:00:54.490> alone

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.470 

they<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:01.950> that<00:01:02.579> doesn't<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:02.970> surprise<00:01:03.210> me

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
they see that doesn't really surprise me

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.930 
they see that doesn't really surprise me
because<00:01:03.810> you<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:04.860> expect<00:01:04.890> about<00:01:05.370> to<00:01:05.820> be

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
because you would expect about to be

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.640 
because you would expect about to be
blown<00:01:06.210> along<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.660> front<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.140> waves

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
blown along in front of the waves

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
blown along in front of the waves
I<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.580> were<00:01:08.700> different<00:01:08.940> yes<00:01:09.240> oh<00:01:09.450> yes

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I mean that were different yes oh yes

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.600 
I mean that were different yes oh yes
but<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.410> moves<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.950> against<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> main

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
but this one moves to against the main

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.060 
but this one moves to against the main
source<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.190 

is<00:01:18.790> incredible

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.779 

you<00:01:26.200> really<00:01:26.439> got<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.740> squeeze<00:01:26.979> up<00:01:27.159> there<00:01:27.369> do<00:01:27.520> it

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
you really got to squeeze up there do it

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.359 
you really got to squeeze up there do it
yes<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:28.450> saw<00:01:28.780> how<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.020> look<00:01:29.469> and<00:01:30.069> this<00:01:30.249> is

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
yes you saw how it look and this is

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.730 
yes you saw how it look and this is
what's<00:01:30.520> responsible<00:01:30.840> yes<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.350> final

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
what's responsible yes this the final

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.010 
what's responsible yes this the final
penlow<00:01:33.069> is<00:01:33.130> finding<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.759> bolt<00:01:33.969> so<00:01:34.659> how<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
penlow is finding the bolt so how is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.169 
penlow is finding the bolt so how is
that<00:01:35.170> foil<00:01:35.500> moving<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.219> boat<00:01:36.369> forward<00:01:36.700> I'll

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
that foil moving the boat forward I'll

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.550 
that foil moving the boat forward I'll
show<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.630> here<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.270> foil<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:40.959> you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
show you here this is a foil and you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.609 
show you here this is a foil and you
have<00:01:42.219> a<00:01:42.250> wing<00:01:42.969> which<00:01:43.569> is<00:01:43.719> kept<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.200> neutral

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
have a wing which is kept in neutral

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.919 
have a wing which is kept in neutral
position<00:01:44.649> by<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.399> spring<00:01:45.759> force<00:01:46.090> sort<00:01:46.869> of

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
position by the spring force sort of

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.550 
position by the spring force sort of
horizontal<00:01:47.170> there<00:01:47.649> yes<00:01:47.890> yes<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:49.289> when<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.439> is

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
horizontal there yes yes and when it is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.529 
horizontal there yes yes and when it is
moved<00:01:50.829> up<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.340> water<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:52.030> get<00:01:52.479> the

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
moved up in the water you get the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.260 
moved up in the water you get the
trailing<00:01:52.840> edge<00:01:53.140> move<00:01:54.069> down<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.640> if<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.030> move

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
trailing edge move down and if you move

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.990 
trailing edge move down and if you move
it<00:01:55.450> down<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:56.379> get<00:01:56.530> trailing<00:01:56.979> edge<00:01:57.099> and<00:01:57.670> this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
it down you get trailing edge and this

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.119 
it down you get trailing edge and this
gives<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.450> propulsion<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:59.259> can<00:01:59.860> show<00:02:00.069> you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:00.129 
gives the propulsion I can show you

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:05.639 
gives the propulsion I can show you
there<00:02:00.429> in<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.700> water<00:02:00.879> wise<00:02:04.319> it's<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.409> same

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
there in the water wise it's the same

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.529 
there in the water wise it's the same
principle<00:02:06.099> as<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.250> dolphin<00:02:06.849> to<00:02:07.030> tailor<00:02:07.299> the

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
principle as the dolphin to tailor the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.589 
principle as the dolphin to tailor the
dolphin<00:02:08.940> now<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.090> must<00:02:10.239> look<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.479> me<00:02:10.569> like

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
dolphin now that must look to me like

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.809 
dolphin now that must look to me like
you're<00:02:10.869> dragging<00:02:11.349> it<00:02:11.470> up<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.280> down<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.579> tank

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
you're dragging it up and down the tank

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.030 
you're dragging it up and down the tank
no<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.109> find<00:02:14.349> him<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.650> dragging<00:02:15.010> me

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
no it is to find him is dragging me

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.210 
no it is to find him is dragging me
really<00:02:15.790> yeah<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.660> fly<00:02:16.870> himself<00:02:17.079> right

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
really yeah you can fly himself right

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.920 
really yeah you can fly himself right
doubting<00:02:18.489> Thomas<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:19.180> right<00:02:19.599> now<00:02:19.750> just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
doubting Thomas here right now just

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.610 
doubting Thomas here right now just
probably<00:02:20.109> took<00:02:20.290> them<00:02:20.410> down<00:02:20.560> yes<00:02:20.859> right<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
probably took them down yes right that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.949 
probably took them down yes right that
is<00:02:23.709> incredible<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.209> shoots<00:02:25.420> around<00:02:25.660> us

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
is incredible it just shoots around us

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.280 
is incredible it just shoots around us
no<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.519> work<00:02:27.549> on<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> full-sized<00:02:28.599> boat

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
no but will it work on a full-sized boat

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.650 
no but will it work on a full-sized boat
files<00:02:30.099> were<00:02:30.340> fitted<00:02:30.639> at<00:02:30.730> each<00:02:30.880> end<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.420> an<00:02:31.540> 8
