00:00:07.204 --> 00:00:11.926
Hi! As you can see, I'm not really being 
 original doing this Draw My Life thing...

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:15.602
But many people asked me to do it and 
 I thought it would be fun to do...

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:20.601
Let's go. My father (from Avila, Spain) went to 
 work as a teacher in Murcia (Spain).

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:23.040
There he met my mother, who is also a teacher...

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.618
And thus, during a 26th of July, I was born...

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:28.819
During summer, my family lived in the country and my mother told me

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.043
that everytime I cried she couldn't tell if it 
 was me or some cat in heat...

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:35.560
I don't remember many stuff from when I was very little

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.470
But I'm sure that I lived in my 
 own world, in my own little bubble.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.741
What I remember best is that I used to watch many Disney films

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:45.982
My favourite one was "The Little Mermaid"

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:49.664
I used to draw thousands of doodles with mermaids or underwater stuff.

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:52.558
I really enjoyed drawing, ever since I can remember.

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:55.958
I remember having a table with a chair attached to 
 it in which I always sat and draw.

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.961
I've always been really shy, so I suppose that while I was at it...

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.141
Other children where probably playing in the street...

00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:06.534
Since my father had an academy where computers lessons were taught (among other stuff)...

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:10.595
I had access to the Internet before most of the child of 
 my age at that time, from where I lived at least...

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:14.476
I really got into it. I liked the Internet and met very kind people

00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:17.631
Truth be told, I wasn't feeling very well during the last high school years.

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:19.916
Let's say it was a quite dark period for me

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:23.602
Almost all my classmates left and I wasn't studying what I really wanted to.

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:27.395
At least I had people like Cris. We chatted 
 and drew together until it was very late.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.028
Even thought that was only through the Internet.

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.948
And... Yes, I'm the one with the ponytail...

00:01:30.948 --> 00:01:33.807
Fortunately, after finishing high school everything got better.

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:35.791
I went to a school of arts to study Graphic Design

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.873
But soon, I caught the eye of a mobile game company

00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:43.080
Thanks to the pixels I went to Salamanca 
 (Spain) to work as a videogame artist

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:47.640
So I joined the Lemons (Yes, our company had a lemon as its mascot)

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:51.120
I was surrounded by many illustrators with different styles

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.680
so I got a lot of inspiration from them. That 
 was the time when I drew A Cat...

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:59.920
At the end of that year I wanted to travel to Japan 
 so I got a camera before, to take pictures of everything.

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.940
There I started drawing faces and stuff on pictures...

00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:07.740
Truth be told, I also had some relationships from which I learned many things

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:09.120
but that's another story...

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.960
During that period I also got my first sketchbook

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.680
Now I have four, three if I don't count the one I lost...

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:19.840
I used to go anywhere with them (and 
 I still do) even when hanging out.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.160
The game company started flopping and I returned to 
 Murcia to finish my Graphic Design studies

00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:27.920
Three years later, after my final degree project (I 
 talked about it in previous videos) 

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:31.200
I got my degree. That's the time when I started doing videos for Youtube

00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:35.650
Now I'm in a strange period, I can't find a decent job

00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:39.560
Nor am I convinced by what I'm studying (A newer degree in Graphic Design)

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.290
What I know for sure is that I'm having fun doing this stuff!

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.800
-Excluding Mother f***er Trolls-

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:46.930
So, for the moment... That's all!

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:54.800
I hope you liked this video and if you feel like 
 doing a Draw My Life, just do it! Bye!
