00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sea buddy it's pretty cool he's like now

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.009 
sea buddy it's pretty cool he's like now
you<00:00:25.500> should<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.189> yeah<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> should

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
um so I was thinking of maybe doing like

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.049 
um so I was thinking of maybe doing like
a<00:00:29.550> weird<00:00:30.150> random<00:00:30.990> seed<00:00:31.349> review<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:32.489> our<00:00:32.700> like

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
a weird random seed review like our like

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.790 
a weird random seed review like our like
once<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.329> week<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.600> something<00:00:33.899> maybe<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
once a week or something maybe if you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.229 
once a week or something maybe if you
guys<00:00:34.950> want<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> weird<00:00:35.969> random

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
guys want to like just a weird random

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.940 
guys want to like just a weird random
word<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.050> turns<00:00:37.260> out<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.710> cool

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
word that turns out to be really cool

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 
word that turns out to be really cool
seed<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.969> that's<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.719> much<00:00:39.930> no<00:00:40.079> seeds<00:00:40.320> are

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
seed so that's pretty much no seeds are

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.080 
seed so that's pretty much no seeds are
made<00:00:40.590> though<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.100> i<00:00:41.219> don't<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.489> i<00:00:41.700> might

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
made though but i don't know i might

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
made though but i don't know i might
occasionally<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.930> reviews<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.530> i

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
occasionally do see reviews now if i

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
occasionally do see reviews now if i
find<00:00:43.800> any<00:00:44.040> cool<00:00:44.160> things<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.640> yeah<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
find any cool things but yeah this is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
find any cool things but yeah this is
our<00:00:45.719> wabbit<00:00:46.260> seed<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> main<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.399> i

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
our wabbit seed and the main thing i

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
our wabbit seed and the main thing i
want<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.850> show<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> guys<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:49.100> um

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
want to show you guys right here is um

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.420 
want to show you guys right here is um
look<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.510> water<00:00:52.199> fall<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
look we got a water fall right here and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
look we got a water fall right here and
we<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> lava<00:00:54.210> fall<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.870> over<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
we got a lava fall right over here and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
we got a lava fall right over here and
the<00:00:56.070> reason<00:00:56.309> why<00:00:56.399> that's<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:56.820> cool<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the reason why that's pretty cool is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.520 
the reason why that's pretty cool is
because<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.690> next<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> each<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
because the right next to each other and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.029 
because the right next to each other and
if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.219> want<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.910> could<00:01:00.109> make<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> lava<00:01:01.469> even

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
if you want you could make the lava even

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.470 
if you want you could make the lava even
water<00:01:02.340> extend<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> each<00:01:03.030> other<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.329> make

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
water extend to each other and make

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.609 
water extend to each other and make
yourself<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> nice<00:01:03.989> cobblestone<00:01:04.589> generator

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
yourself a nice cobblestone generator

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.250 
yourself a nice cobblestone generator
which<00:01:05.220> i'll<00:01:05.369> show<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.510> did<00:01:07.110> it's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
which i'll show you right now i did it's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.429 
which i'll show you right now i did it's
in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.280> world<00:01:08.549> right<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.450> ready

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
in the this world right here and ready

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.060 
in the this world right here and ready
check<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.119> where<00:01:12.119> am<00:01:12.180> i<00:01:12.270> okay<00:01:12.900> oh<00:01:13.380> no<00:01:13.950> i'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
check it out where am i okay oh no i'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
check it out where am i okay oh no i'm
not<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> other<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.390> fly<00:01:15.689> over

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
not even the other thing I only fly over

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.429 
not even the other thing I only fly over
real<00:01:16.170> quick<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:17.220> V<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.509> Lava<00:01:18.750> Falls<00:01:18.869> right

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
real quick to V or the Lava Falls right

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.490 
real quick to V or the Lava Falls right
here<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.840> basically<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> best

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
here it is so basically I'm not the best

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
here it is so basically I'm not the best
timing<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> cobblestone<00:01:23.130> generator<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
timing a cobblestone generator but I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.710 
timing a cobblestone generator but I
expanded<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.770> water<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> lava<00:01:26.720> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
expanded it the water in the lava and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.140 
expanded it the water in the lava and
this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> got<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
this is what I got right here it is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
this is what I got right here it is
beautiful<00:01:30.479> look<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.290> cobblestone

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
beautiful look at that a cobblestone

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270 
beautiful look at that a cobblestone
generator<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.939> check<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:35.100> boom

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
generator see check it out what boom

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
generator see check it out what boom
that's<00:01:35.579> la<00:01:35.820> Vong<00:01:36.060> water<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.540> cobblestone

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that's la Vong water for cobblestone

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
that's la Vong water for cobblestone
generator<00:01:36.869> that's<00:01:37.350> pretty<00:01:37.650> cool<00:01:37.829> that's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
generator that's pretty cool that's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.859 
generator that's pretty cool that's
pretty<00:01:38.790> much<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> main<00:01:39.210> highlight<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
pretty much the main highlight of this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
pretty much the main highlight of this
