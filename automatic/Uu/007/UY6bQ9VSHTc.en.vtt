or the edge which is awesome but the 3g

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.770

itself<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:47.250> up<00:04:47.400> fast<00:04:47.700> because<00:04:48.330> your<00:04:48.450> battery

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
itself it's up fast because your battery

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.330 
itself it's up fast because your battery
a<00:04:48.870> little<00:04:49.110> faster<00:04:49.470> than<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.710> edgewood<00:04:50.100> but
