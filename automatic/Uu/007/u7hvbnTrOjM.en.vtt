00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.470 

the<00:00:05.040> first<00:00:05.310> time<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.730> set<00:00:06.060> up<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.270> wireless

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
the first time that I set up a wireless

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.150 
the first time that I set up a wireless
printer<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> bit<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.799> hit-and-miss

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
printer it was a bit of a hit-and-miss

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.459 
printer it was a bit of a hit-and-miss
procedure<00:00:08.730> but<00:00:09.269> today's<00:00:09.599> wireless<00:00:09.840> printers

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
procedure but today's wireless printers

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.009 
procedure but today's wireless printers
far<00:00:11.070> more<00:00:11.309> user-friendly<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.420> big<00:00:12.660> part<00:00:12.870> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
far more user-friendly and a big part of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.000 
far more user-friendly and a big part of
that<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.009> growth<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.540> upnp<00:00:15.540> or<00:00:16.010> universal

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that is the growth of upnp or universal

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
that is the growth of upnp or universal
plug<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> play<00:00:17.760> which<00:00:18.029> theoretically<00:00:18.650> makes

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
plug and play which theoretically makes

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.529 
plug and play which theoretically makes
connecting<00:00:20.160> wireless<00:00:20.580> devices<00:00:20.850> much<00:00:21.180> easier

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
connecting wireless devices much easier

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
connecting wireless devices much easier
just<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.560> took<00:00:22.710> us<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.670> time<00:00:23.880> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
just like it took us be some time to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
just like it took us be some time to
become<00:00:24.150> real<00:00:24.660> plug<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.140> play<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.619> just

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
become real plug and play and not just

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.859 
become real plug and play and not just
plug<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.189> pray<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:27.269> taken<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> while<00:00:27.689> for

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
plug and pray it's taken a while for

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.589 
plug and pray it's taken a while for
upnp<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:29.189> hit<00:00:29.340> its<00:00:29.519> stride<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.420> let's

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
upnp to really hit its stride but let's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.299 
upnp to really hit its stride but let's
dive<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.349> let's<00:00:31.619> connect<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> sea

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
dive right in and let's connect the sea

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.729 
dive right in and let's connect the sea
81-82<00:00:33.239> our<00:00:33.540> wireless<00:00:34.020> network<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.500> I've<00:00:34.590> got<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
81-82 our wireless network so I've got a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.130 
81-82 our wireless network so I've got a
Wi-Fi<00:00:35.219> network<00:00:35.250> setup<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.930> studio

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Wi-Fi network setup here in the studio

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
Wi-Fi network setup here in the studio
we<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.739> plug<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.700> haven't<00:00:38.940> done

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
we just plug this in and we haven't done

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299 
we just plug this in and we haven't done
any<00:00:39.360> configuration<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> time

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
any configuration at all so it is time

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.880 
any configuration at all so it is time
for<00:00:41.520> us<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.670> set<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.410> find<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
for us to set it up and have it find the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
for us to set it up and have it find the
wireless<00:00:44.100> network<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> first<00:00:45.180> time<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
wireless network now the first time I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
wireless network now the first time I
did<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.719> way<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> day<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
did this way back in the day off with a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
did this way back in the day off with a
wireless<00:00:47.760> printer<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.300> actually<00:00:48.899> had<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> plug

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
wireless printer I actually had to plug

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.840 
wireless printer I actually had to plug
the<00:00:49.860> printer<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.280> first<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the printer in first of all to a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
the printer in first of all to a
computer<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.020> configured<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.649> then

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
computer get it all configured and then

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.350 
computer get it all configured and then
plug<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> into<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> network<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.059> sorts

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
plug it into the network and all sorts

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.630 
plug it into the network and all sorts
of<00:00:54.390> things<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.690> took<00:00:54.780> several<00:00:55.440> stages<00:00:55.739> no<00:00:56.370> more

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
of things it took several stages no more

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
of things it took several stages no more
this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.660> should<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this is the way it should be in the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.459 
this is the way it should be in the
setup<00:00:59.039> menu<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.730> into<00:00:59.879> network<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> then

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
setup menu I go into network and then

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
setup menu I go into network and then
just<00:01:01.739> run<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.489> wireless<00:01:03.030> setup<00:01:03.329> wizard<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
just run the wireless setup wizard this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.750 
just run the wireless setup wizard this
is<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.350> far<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.680> away<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.100> easiest

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is going to be far and away the easiest

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.370 
is going to be far and away the easiest
way<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> setup<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.330> network<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.229> now

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
way to setup your network and it's now

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
way to setup your network and it's now

I can choose from among them I'm going

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
I can choose from among them I'm going

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to choose the d-link router which I have

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
to choose the d-link router which I have
here<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.240> had<00:01:24.450> an<00:01:24.600> encryption<00:01:24.960> key<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.439> I

here and if I had an encryption key if I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
here and if I had an encryption key if I
had<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> secure<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:27.479> ask<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
had it secure it would then ask me to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.800 
had it secure it would then ask me to
input<00:01:28.650> all<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.100> data<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.540> goes

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
input all of that data and then it goes

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.960 
input all of that data and then it goes
out<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.259> tries<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> connect<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> Wi-Fi

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
of this of the multifunction device we

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.410 
of this of the multifunction device we
see<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.709> we<00:03:46.829> are<00:03:46.859> Wi-Fi<00:03:47.400> radio<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.970> turned<00:03:48.239> on

see that we are Wi-Fi radio is turned on

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.330 
see that we are Wi-Fi radio is turned on
but<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> bluetooth<00:03:49.350> radio<00:03:49.560> isn't<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.220> the

I've turned the Bluetooth radio on it

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.550 
I've turned the Bluetooth radio on it
will<00:04:06.329> be<00:04:06.450> discoverable<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.109> can<00:04:07.290> make<00:04:07.410> it

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
will be discoverable I can make it

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.680 
will be discoverable I can make it
discoverable<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.370> i<00:04:08.400> can<00:04:08.519> connect<00:04:09.090> my

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.870 
camera phone to the bluetooth device
once<00:04:13.079> I've<00:04:13.260> done<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.829> can<00:04:14.250> go<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.760> I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
once I've done that I can go in and I

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.270 
once I've done that I can go in and I
can<00:04:15.060> edit<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.450> passkey<00:04:15.989> now<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> passkey<00:04:17.130> is

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
can edit the passkey now a passkey is

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.979 
can edit the passkey now a passkey is
basically<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.030> security<00:04:18.539> levels<00:04:18.870> in

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
basically the security levels in

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.390 
basically the security levels in
Bluetooth<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.829> what<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.039> does<00:04:20.159> is<00:04:20.370> it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
Bluetooth and what it does is it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.310 
Bluetooth and what it does is it
prevents<00:04:20.760> unauthorized<00:04:21.030> Bluetooth<00:04:21.959> devices

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
prevents unauthorized Bluetooth devices

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.170 
prevents unauthorized Bluetooth devices
from<00:04:22.560> talking<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.130> each<00:04:23.250> other<00:04:23.430> now<00:04:23.940> there's

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
from talking to each other now there's

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.520 
from talking to each other now there's
not<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.360> big<00:04:24.599> security<00:04:24.900> concern

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
not a big security concern

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.590 
not a big security concern
over<00:04:25.680> your<00:04:25.770> printer<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.550> leaving<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.210> passkey

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600

the<00:04:35.100> passkey<00:04:35.520> I'm<00:04:35.790> not<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.210> bother

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
the passkey I'm not going to bother

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.450 
the passkey I'm not going to bother
instead<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:37.050> going<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.620> go<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.830> my<00:04:37.950> camera

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
instead I'm going to go to my camera

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.330 
instead I'm going to go to my camera
phone<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:38.850> I'm<00:04:39.419> going<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> connect<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:41.070> the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
phone and I'm going to connect it to the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.860 
phone and I'm going to connect it to the
printer<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.150> nice<00:04:42.480> simple

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
printer and this is a nice simple

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.320 
printer and this is a nice simple
process<00:04:43.380> as<00:04:43.560> well<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.220> every<00:04:44.730> camera<00:04:45.060> phone<00:04:45.210> is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
process as well so every camera phone is

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.909 
process as well so every camera phone is
going<00:04:45.480> to<00:04:45.540> be<00:04:45.630> slightly<00:04:45.930> different<00:04:46.200> in<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
going to be slightly different in the

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:47.990 
going to be slightly different in the
blackberry<00:04:47.280> here<00:04:47.490> I've<00:04:47.610> got<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.790> little

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
blackberry here I've got a little
