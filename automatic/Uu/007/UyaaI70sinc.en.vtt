00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.870 
I thought this one was a little bit more
fall<00:03:05.680> appropriate<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:06.730> is

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
fall appropriate and I think this is

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.210 
fall appropriate and I think this is
from<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.120> newer<00:03:07.300> collection<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:09.070> very

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
from a newer collection so it's very

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.979 
from a newer collection so it's very
pretty<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.820> then<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.360> second<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.750> last

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
pretty and then the second the last

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.840 
pretty and then the second the last
thing<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.320> got<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.890> jumpsuit<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.700> my

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
thing I got is a jumpsuit and this is my

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.430 
thing I got is a jumpsuit and this is my
least<00:03:13.060> favorite<00:03:13.180> thing<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.900> got<00:03:14.110> just

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
least favorite thing that I got just

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.500 
least favorite thing that I got just
because<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.709> have<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.160> clock<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:16.209> because<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
because I have a clock just because I

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.180 
because I have a clock just because I
