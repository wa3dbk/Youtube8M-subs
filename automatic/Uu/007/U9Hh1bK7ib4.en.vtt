the<00:00:30.039> reason<00:00:30.429> for<00:00:30.460> that<00:00:30.640> was<00:00:30.789> let's<00:00:31.779> play<00:00:32.019> a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
the reason for that was let's play a

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.290 
the reason for that was let's play a
variation<00:00:32.439> on<00:00:32.890> this<00:00:33.070> lick<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.670> when<00:00:33.970> we<00:00:34.090> do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
variation on this lick and when we do

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.689 
variation on this lick and when we do
come<00:00:34.570> up<00:00:34.600> through<00:00:34.960> this<00:00:35.080> position<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.769> this<00:00:35.890> to

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
come up through this position to this to

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.820 
come up through this position to this to
this<00:00:36.729> spot<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.540> this<00:00:37.690> lick<00:00:38.019> we're<00:00:38.500> going<00:00:38.589> to<00:00:38.650> do

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
this spot in this lick we're going to do

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.649 
this spot in this lick we're going to do
a<00:00:38.860> pinch<00:00:39.220> and<00:00:39.519> we're<00:00:39.850> going<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.059> do<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.390> pinch

right hand together you can see why

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.410 
right hand together you can see why
practicing<00:00:47.379> with<00:00:47.500> both<00:00:47.799> fingers<00:00:48.549> will<00:00:49.239> give

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
practicing with both fingers will give

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.450 
practicing with both fingers will give
you<00:00:49.570> more<00:00:49.839> of<00:00:49.869> a<00:00:50.140> better<00:00:50.799> feel<00:00:51.190> when

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
you more of a better feel when

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.009 
you more of a better feel when
approaching<00:00:51.850> these<00:00:52.150> pinches<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.930> that

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
approaching these pinches so for that

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:04.170 
approaching these pinches so for that
variation<00:00:56.680> we<00:00:56.799> just<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.190> this<00:01:03.180> relative

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
variation we just have this relative

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.760 
variation we just have this relative
minor<00:01:04.390> we're<00:01:04.960> just<00:01:05.049> going<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.290> do<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.530> pinch

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
minor we're just going to do the pinch

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.590 
minor we're just going to do the pinch
on<00:01:06.010> me<00:01:06.159> first<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.939> second<00:01:07.270> string<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:13.360> just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
on me first and second string that just

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.330 
on me first and second string that just
makes<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.050> lick<00:01:14.230> sound<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.620> little<00:01:14.770> bit<00:01:15.010> fuller

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
makes the lick sound a little bit fuller

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.190 
makes the lick sound a little bit fuller
I'm<00:01:15.790> not<00:01:15.970> saying<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.540> have<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.750> put<00:01:17.050> the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
I'm not saying that you have to put the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.220 
I'm not saying that you have to put the
pinch<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:18.040> mix<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.460> up<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.930> can<00:01:23.050> hear

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
pinch in you can mix it up you can hear

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:32.960 
pinch in you can mix it up you can hear
the<00:01:23.380> slight<00:01:23.650> difference

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.220 

there<00:01:33.970> was<00:01:34.120> another<00:01:34.360> role<00:01:34.630> pattern<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.170> I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
there was another role pattern that I

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.670 
there was another role pattern that I
put<00:01:35.620> just<00:01:35.800> behind<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.220> lick<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:38.440> was

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
put just behind that lick that was

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.810 
put just behind that lick that was
starting<00:01:39.160> off<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.720> backward<00:01:40.720> forward<00:01:41.050> roll

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
starting off a backward forward roll

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.300 
starting off a backward forward roll
these<00:01:42.820> are<00:01:42.970> roles<00:01:43.270> throughout<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:44.310> again

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
these are roles throughout that again

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.830 
these are roles throughout that again
you<00:01:45.490> should<00:01:45.550> be<00:01:45.820> familiar<00:01:46.000> with<00:01:46.300> from<00:01:46.630> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
you should be familiar with from the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.219 
you should be familiar with from the
very<00:01:47.580> introduction<00:01:48.580> lesson<00:01:51.780> again<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:53.050> has<00:01:53.200> a

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
thumb on the middle string index on the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.530 
thumb on the middle string index on the
middle<00:03:22.490> string<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:23.210> we're<00:03:23.390> going<00:03:23.480> to

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
middle string and then we're going to

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.570 
middle string and then we're going to
come<00:03:23.630> up<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.110> 4th<00:03:24.380> fret<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:24.980> our<00:03:25.070> first<00:03:25.310> two

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
come up to the 4th fret so our first two

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.230 
come up to the 4th fret so our first two
notes<00:03:25.820> are<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:27.160> for<00:03:28.160> our<00:03:28.310> triplet<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.940> make<00:03:29.090> it

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
notes are now for our triplet to make it

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.000 
notes are now for our triplet to make it
three<00:03:29.480> notes<00:03:29.690> within<00:03:29.960> that<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.440> note<00:03:30.680> space

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
three notes within that to note space

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.010 
three notes within that to note space
we're<00:03:31.640> basically<00:03:31.970> doing<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.600> forward<00:03:32.840> roll

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
we're basically doing a forward roll

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.830 
we're basically doing a forward roll
except<00:03:33.800> we're<00:03:33.950> doing<00:03:34.330> two<00:03:35.330> notes<00:03:35.570> on<00:03:35.750> the

except we're doing two notes on the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.770 
except we're doing two notes on the
third<00:03:36.050> string<00:03:36.910> now<00:03:37.910> we're<00:03:38.090> coming<00:03:38.270> up<00:03:38.600> and

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
third string now we're coming up and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.350 
third string now we're coming up and
picking<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.710> second<00:03:40.130> string<00:03:40.430> how<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.030> see<00:03:41.330> it

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
picking the second string how you see it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.150 
picking the second string how you see it
Fred<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:41.750> there<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.320> we're<00:03:42.680> picking<00:03:43.010> that

Fred it there and we're picking that

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.500 
Fred it there and we're picking that
with<00:03:43.280> our<00:03:43.310> middle<00:03:43.670> finger<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.180> there's<00:03:44.420> our

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
with our middle finger so there's our

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.000 
with our middle finger so there's our
forward<00:03:45.020> roll

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:59.020 

and<00:03:52.010> again<00:03:52.879> to<00:03:53.030> make<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.390> triplet<00:03:57.819> play<00:03:58.819> that

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
and again to make that triplet play that

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.819 
and again to make that triplet play that
over<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.450> over<00:03:59.480> again<00:03:59.719> until<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.260> instill

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
over and over again until you instill

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:09.729 
over and over again until you instill
that<00:04:00.859> into<00:04:01.280> your<00:04:01.489> right<00:04:01.700> hand<00:04:08.200> again<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:09.500> have

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
that into your right hand again we have

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:18.460 
that into your right hand again we have
with<00:04:10.129> no<00:04:10.310> triplet<00:04:13.420> now<00:04:14.420> with<00:04:14.599> triplets<00:04:17.470> so

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
with no triplet now with triplets so

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.550 
with no triplet now with triplets so
let's<00:04:18.769> do<00:04:18.919> three<00:04:19.220> triplets<00:04:19.699> in<00:04:19.880> that

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
let's do three triplets in that

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.749 
let's do three triplets in that
formation<00:04:23.800> then<00:04:24.800> come<00:04:25.039> down<00:04:25.070> on<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.490> fourth

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
formation then come down on the fourth

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.270 
formation then come down on the fourth
string<00:04:25.820> again<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.539> quarter<00:04:27.020> note<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.440> we<00:04:28.130> can

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
string again a quarter note and we can

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.029 
string again a quarter note and we can
bring<00:04:28.789> our<00:04:28.880> pinkie<00:04:29.300> back<00:04:29.509> up<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:29.960> do<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.259> do

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
bring our pinkie back up and do that do

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:44.239 
bring our pinkie back up and do that do
a<00:04:31.070> roll<00:04:31.310> pattern<00:04:31.729> again

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:44.249 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.489 

that's<00:04:44.999> a<00:04:45.149> cool<00:04:45.329> boogie-woogie<00:04:46.049> sound<00:04:46.319> that

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:46.499 
that's a cool boogie-woogie sound that

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.589 
that's a cool boogie-woogie sound that
you<00:04:46.649> get<00:04:46.829> it<00:04:46.919> out<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.039> that<00:04:47.789> pattern<00:04:48.119> using

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
you get it out of that pattern using

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.539 
you get it out of that pattern using
those<00:04:48.809> triplets<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.529> there<00:04:49.859> again<00:04:50.189> the

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:50.549 
those triplets and there again the

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:53.299 
those triplets and there again the
combination<00:04:51.239> of<00:04:51.479> notes<00:04:51.779> and<00:04:52.139> licks<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:53.039> you

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:53.309 
combination of notes and licks that you

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.779 
combination of notes and licks that you
can<00:04:53.489> come<00:04:53.639> up<00:04:53.759> with<00:04:53.939> on<00:04:54.119> your<00:04:54.149> own<00:04:54.329> are<00:04:55.789> never

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
can come up with on your own are never

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.359 
can come up with on your own are never
ending<00:04:57.349> there's<00:04:58.349> there's<00:04:58.829> always<00:04:59.159> a<00:04:59.189> new

00:04:59.359 --> 00:04:59.369 
ending there's there's always a new

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:01.579 
ending there's there's always a new
pattern<00:04:59.609> or<00:05:00.119> new<00:05:00.599> sequence<00:05:01.019> of<00:05:01.169> notes<00:05:01.349> that

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:01.589 
pattern or new sequence of notes that

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.559 
pattern or new sequence of notes that
you<00:05:01.679> can<00:05:01.829> put<00:05:01.979> together<00:05:02.279> and<00:05:03.089> again<00:05:03.389> we're

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
you can put together and again we're

you can put together and again we're
going<00:05:03.659> to<00:05:03.749> be<00:05:03.869> putting<00:05:04.109> down<00:05:04.349> all<00:05:04.529> kind<00:05:04.859> of

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
going to be putting down all kind of

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.279 
going to be putting down all kind of
ideas<00:05:05.999> for<00:05:06.029> you<00:05:06.329> so<00:05:06.629> hopefully<00:05:06.959> you<00:05:07.109> can

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
ideas for you so hopefully you can

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.249 
ideas for you so hopefully you can

licks<00:05:14.189> within<00:05:14.579> the<00:05:14.729> same<00:05:15.029> formation<00:05:15.419> and

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
licks within the same formation and

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.359 
licks within the same formation and
