kind<00:07:40.220> of<00:07:40.250> weird<00:07:40.370> ending<00:07:40.730> this<00:07:41.740> video<00:07:42.740> just

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.070 
kind of weird ending this video just

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.550 
kind of weird ending this video just
like<00:07:43.160> this<00:07:43.250> but<00:07:43.730> don't<00:07:44.660> worry<00:07:44.810> i<00:07:45.050> was<00:07:45.350> in<00:07:45.470> the

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560
