00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.300
 hello and welcome to video michel drucker 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.520
 so for his first lessons will talk purpose 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.859
 the elected chess board I present to you we spoke 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.959
 the representation of the pieces 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.959
 and the arrangement of the pieces on the chessboard 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.130
 so when you have a chessboard 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.749
 which includes eight columns 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.919
 who are the traits 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.699
 what to buy 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.319
 as can be seen here 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.789
 and put them away 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.789
 which are therefore numbered 20 8 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.950
 so a chess board includes these are 4 15 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.710
 thirty two black squares 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.470
 the thirty-two branch cases 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.960
 so now we're going to move pieces one by one on the chessboard 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 and I will start for 100 th by the big white 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.890
 for me it is clearly the construction site 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 so I start with the tower 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 who will be located 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.960
 first white place 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 I move to the second 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.110
 the horseman 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 tuvalu lie big bay 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.210
 after I put the madman 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 in c1 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.060
 the Lady 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 amber 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.390
 that's the question we can legitimately 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.119
 request will come back later in the next lesson 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.780
 for moving parts 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.690
 then the role 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.810
 which is next to love 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 antoine 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 but what is happening 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.690
 at the moment the catch at mtq 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.640
 then place a second fool 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 in f1 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 another rider 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 but the last round 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 so now on the bordeaux side have passed the objects to st 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.289
 it remains to pass 8 then 11 so it's not difficult and then we press at 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.129
 above 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.109
 on the second row 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 Julian dupuy so I place them 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.809
 3 first payment to 2 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.359
 these two 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.319
 d2 2 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.769
 I want to play 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.009
 So here we replace the parts on the side of us 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.619
 and percent knowing that it's the same thing on the right the number the same 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.709
 thing 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.199
 because symmetrical 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.349
 so in the opposite side when I attack manage placed ranking 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.279
 the first 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.730
 tournament here 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.189
 why him 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.659
 it's the second 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.949
 Free 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.159
 the same jumper is symmetrical with respect to the white position 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.279
 so that we go back even 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.829
 a jumper in bis and 8 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.099
 the rider of the myth 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.979
 the pair of crazy the two ovens actually 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.939
 which is also called the crazy pair 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.159
 6 8 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.939
 and then 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.659
 the black lady 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.629
 very important piece 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.599
 and the right king 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.749
 gold more important 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.429
 to finally be eaten 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.469
 so the pieces - are placed 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.759
 but I will finish with the eight days 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.759
 so I always come here why this 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.859
 bessette these seven 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.859
 two sets 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.529
 she wishes 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.359
 jet set and buy 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.969
 you will understand later that it is really important to know the 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.119
 the coordinates of the chessboard 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.589
 it is to operate the pieces on the chessboard 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.459
 but I explained to you a bit later and it comes very quickly from 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.069
 way 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.109
 so I make a last little respite summary on the parts 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.239
 so that the white pieces will be enough I like something to other countries 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.329
 right here 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.340
 it's the tower 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.799
 in beta 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.739
 belga 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.110
 it's the rider 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.370
 the group 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.129
 the amended 1 me 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.110
 the king 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.999
 however, it is necessary 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.810
 his machine 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.099
 the second riders 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.749
 and in room 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.879
 the last round 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.120
 here and on the second row here 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.719
 within eight days 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.719
 and therefore separated from the other side 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.499
 so I think you got to know the chessboard 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.650
 you know the layout of the pieces 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.919
 and their ideal representation for us would be to work kaneishi 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.979
 who next to you 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.539
 so you can buy it does not cost much online you have 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.539
 found a lot of situations days variants 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.889
 the checkerboard of the opera all that ticket chic and cheap plastic and 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.099
 rooms 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.099
 the giant of provence for the 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.969
 so for the shears of the comments to make 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.539
 ideas of remarks 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.169
 on the home page a contact section 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.169
 Ouch a contact form you can fill 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.909
 it will be interesting and directly in box mail I will do all my 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.969
 possible to answer 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.969
 so I'll see you soon for a 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.839
 which will concern the moving of parts 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.389
 it is 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.089
 a good part 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.189
 Not now but soon 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.689
 to see them again
