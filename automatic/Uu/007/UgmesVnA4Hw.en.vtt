not just for a day or a week or a month
but<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.769> year<00:02:29.219> after<00:02:29.579> year<00:02:29.909> of<00:02:30.030> making<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
but it is year after year of making the

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.990 
but it is year after year of making the
progress<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.099> you've<00:02:32.400> seen<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.790> recent

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
progress and if you've seen the recent

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.080 
progress and if you've seen the recent
videos<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.629> me<00:02:33.750> benching<00:02:34.200> 325<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.579> took<00:02:35.879> me

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
videos of me benching 325 that took me

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.809 
videos of me benching 325 that took me
over<00:02:36.599> 25<00:02:37.230> years<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.829> finally<00:02:38.099> bench<00:02:38.549> that

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
over 25 years to finally bench that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.449 
over 25 years to finally bench that
after<00:02:39.659> three<00:02:39.959> knee<00:02:40.170> surgeries<00:02:40.709> I'm<00:02:40.889> getting

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
after three knee surgeries I'm getting

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.369 
after three knee surgeries I'm getting
back<00:02:41.639> and<00:02:41.909> chasing<00:02:42.269> my<00:02:42.420> heavier<00:02:42.750> squats<00:02:43.170> again

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
back and chasing my heavier squats again
