00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
all right

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.950 
all right
so<00:04:07.710> there<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.100> is

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
so there it is

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.160 
so there it is
I'm<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:10.530> gonna<00:04:10.740> try<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.760> pull<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.870> without

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170

letting<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.770> slack<00:04:14.130> out

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.960 

my<00:04:34.780> guess<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.590> time<00:04:35.980> this<00:04:36.640> is<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.820> time

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
my guess is the time this is the time

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.860 
my guess is the time this is the time
nope<00:04:38.310> because<00:04:39.310> all<00:04:39.700> this<00:04:39.850> extra<00:04:40.210> tracks<00:04:40.570> on
