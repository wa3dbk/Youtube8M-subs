00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 some an analysis what was this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.210
 tie and that is logical 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.879
 I think we missed a lot, we kept the 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.900
 position of the ball against almost all 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.759
 party or them 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.759
 we knew he had a defensive tactic 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.119
 with some sporadic backlash 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.119
 we look for all the variants 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.609
 that we had at our disposal today 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.560
 especially I think we fail in the 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.390
 final instance in the good center in the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.110
 good flight pass in the definition that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 we had several 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.219
 the equipment play functionally well 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.929
 positionally also undoubtedly 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.089
 not in the effectiveness 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.940
 it is clear that they closed several goals 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.920
 but you could have some words with 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.039
 never villafaÃ±a in this class a player 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.010
 When a play fails, it says size 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.649
 it's not going to be easy to sleep for him 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.420
 ok but that we have to sleep sleep 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.890
 trust believe the way is open 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.610
 nobody said that we were going to win all 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.310
 the parties 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.360
 10 12 matches in a row was Argentine 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.410
 livestock is impossible 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.240
 I do not put that appreciation before 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.100
 rival of turn of all the rivals of the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920
 Argentine soccer 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.900
 this equipment is difficult and not really 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 without that corrido always says so 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.290
 switched on 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 we have to believe and trust and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.600
 know that the door exists 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.360
 I do not know how much closer or how much more 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320
 far but we fully trust in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 arrive to a good port 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.740
 has experience the tournament can be 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 get to regret these two points 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.510
 lost we let the tournament end 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.930
 as we then see how we move it and 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.380
 and for these two points are vital for 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.540
 this match two points are vital in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 that moment the players transport 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.650
 party is what comes forward that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.570
 we believe in them we trust we have a 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.480
 party within a couple of days nothing 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.640
 there's another one inside three days later 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.310
 that you have to go ahead and fight 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 I have a high commission a fortress 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.750
 important spiritual we spend so many 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.670
 other works throughout the year we are not going 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.780
 to take advantage of this good moment you have to 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.150
 wait and be able to seize 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 frank patients a question this from 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.430
 have played against the last one in the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 table have won the first and play 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.180
 with the last the table is harmful or 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.829
 the most trusted player comes out 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.099
 I do not see it that way, I think if you 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.299
 pretend managed to follow the any in 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.299
 any circumstances 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.069
 maybe the frame more than a match 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.260
 league but I say respectfully without 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.109
 without shouting without the environment of all that 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.909
 it would seem better to protect them a bit 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.069
 but it should not be like that I do not like it 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.180
 name so I think on the contrary I think 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.640
 that we did for a moment a very good 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.069
 very good game holding so the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.930
 court could but our great 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.420
 deficit was in our area is given 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.549
 account that in the second time he put 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.760
 more than in the first time they played 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.299
 quite relaxed I did not think no 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.299
 coincided 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.370
 I did not see distension there are moments of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.370
 team moments inside the match 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.530
 under no point of view of a team 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.019
 relaxed and a team in the first 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.200
 time I was trying to be uncomfortable in 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.150
 the start a rival all tucked back with 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.349
 five defenders plus three flyers and two 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.420
 front practically on their own 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.909
 field had to look for ways to 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.950
 to penetrate to have width of field to have 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.510
 direct passes in order and he went looking 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.510
 until averaging the first time 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.849
 the possession was found verticality 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.269
 and the options do not specify them or the 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.269
 second
