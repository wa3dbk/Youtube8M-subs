00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
somewhere and then move it around a

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.150 
somewhere and then move it around a
little<00:01:04.250> bit<00:01:05.260> it's<00:01:06.260> like<00:01:06.350> second<00:01:06.710> nature<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.010> me

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
little bit it's like second nature to me

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.100 
little bit it's like second nature to me
because<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:07.520> use<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:07.940> often<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.930> also

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
this is when the 3d when the person

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.070 
this is when the 3d when the person
designs<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.550> 3d<00:01:34.850> model<00:01:35.270> there<00:01:35.480> may<00:01:35.720> or<00:01:35.900> may

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.270 
designs the 3d model there may or may
not<00:01:36.110> be<00:01:37.510> flaws<00:01:38.510> in<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:38.990> 3d<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.770> there<00:01:40.040> are

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
not be flaws in the 3d and there are

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.240 
not be flaws in the 3d and there are
like<00:01:40.580> extra<00:01:41.090> planes<00:01:41.450> sticking<00:01:42.350> out<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.830> that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
like extra planes sticking out and that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.190 
like extra planes sticking out and that
the<00:01:43.610> person<00:01:44.000> doesn't<00:01:44.180> want<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.480> clean<00:01:44.690> up<00:01:44.720> and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
the person doesn't want to clean up and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.740 
the person doesn't want to clean up and
pepakura<00:01:46.100> doesn't<00:01:46.700> allow<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.300> delete

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.220 
pepakura doesn't allow you to delete
these<00:01:48.320> flaws<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.030> what<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.300> designer<00:01:50.660> does<00:01:50.990> is

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
these flaws so what the designer does is

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.310 
these flaws so what the designer does is
they<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:53.120> can<00:01:53.330> actually<00:01:53.540> move<00:01:54.050> these

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
they you you can actually move these

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.740 
they you you can actually move these
pieces<00:01:54.650> around<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.400> what<00:01:56.210> they<00:01:56.360> do<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.600> they

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
pieces around and what they do is they

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.630 
pieces around and what they do is they
move<00:01:57.020> these<00:01:57.260> pieces<00:01:57.530> out<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.130> white<00:01:58.340> plane

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
move these pieces out of the white plane

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.470 
move these pieces out of the white plane
so<00:01:58.940> when<00:01:59.120> you're<00:01:59.270> printing<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.990> does<00:02:00.620> not<00:02:01.480> get

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
so when you're printing it does not get

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.460 
so when you're printing it does not get
printed<00:02:02.930> because<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.830> don't<00:02:04.010> need<00:02:04.160> these<00:02:04.370> so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
printed because you don't need these so

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.880 
printed because you don't need these so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
right here what it does is it it opens

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.170 
right here what it does is it it opens
and<00:03:18.220> closes<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:20.700> connections<00:03:21.700> between<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and closes the connections between the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.590 
and closes the connections between the
tabs<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.160> I'm<00:03:24.580> clicking<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> 3<00:03:25.390> color

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
button right here and this is what

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.979 
button right here and this is what
happens<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.239> I'm<00:03:28.540> gonna<00:03:28.690> leave<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.110> open<00:03:29.520> one

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
happens so I'm gonna leave it open one

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.410 
happens so I'm gonna leave it open one
because<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.290> use<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.190> figure<00:03:33.400> out<00:03:33.700> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
because I use it to figure out the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420 
because I use it to figure out the
orientation<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:36.959> confusing<00:03:37.959> pieces<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:39.040> like

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
orientation of confusing pieces so like

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.110 
orientation of confusing pieces so like
if<00:03:39.670> if<00:03:39.970> you're<00:03:40.239> trying<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.600> do<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.989> leg<00:03:42.390> see<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
if if you're trying to do the leg see so

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.970 
if if you're trying to do the leg see so
let's<00:03:46.120> say<00:03:46.300> you're<00:03:46.630> you've<00:03:47.200> worked<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.709> this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
let's say you're you've worked on this

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.180 
let's say you're you've worked on this
part<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.610> your<00:03:49.510> next<00:03:49.780> piece<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.170> here<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.950> may

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
part and your next piece is here it may

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.479 
part and your next piece is here it may
be<00:03:51.250> confusing<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:52.030> figure<00:03:52.570> out<00:03:52.980> which<00:03:53.980> way<00:03:54.280> it

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
be confusing to figure out which way it

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.820 
be confusing to figure out which way it
goes<00:03:54.519> like<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.360> line<00:03:56.200> may<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.800> other

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
goes like this line may be on the other

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.310 
goes like this line may be on the other
side<00:03:57.040> or<00:03:57.690> sometimes<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.810> do<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:59.080> backwards

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
side or sometimes I do it backwards

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.880 
side or sometimes I do it backwards
though<00:04:00.220> when<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.050> was<00:04:02.050> kind<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.350> obvious<00:04:02.440> here

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
though when you was kind of obvious here

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.830 
though when you was kind of obvious here
but<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:04.000> see<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.600> piece

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
but like you you see on this piece

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.770 
but like you you see on this piece
here's<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:06.280> opening<00:04:06.400> right<00:04:07.330> there

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
here's the opening right there

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.460 
here's the opening right there
the<00:04:08.170> next<00:04:08.500> piece<00:04:08.680> has<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.010> opening<00:04:09.730> that

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
the next piece has the opening that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.290 
the next piece has the opening that
connects<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.830> previous<00:04:12.250> opening<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.269> I

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
connects to the previous opening so I

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.420 
connects to the previous opening so I
use<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.540> as<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.959> reference<00:04:14.170> point<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.950> if<00:04:15.280> you

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
use that as a reference point and if you

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.870 
use that as a reference point and if you
do<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.820> you'll<00:04:16.180> never<00:04:16.720> make<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.320> model

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
do that you'll never make the model

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.630 
do that you'll never make the model
backwards<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:20.769> has<00:04:20.980> happened<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.489> me

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
backwards and that has happened to me

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.140 
backwards and that has happened to me
before<00:04:21.790> so<00:04:22.200> yeah<00:04:23.260> Pepa<00:04:23.590> coda<00:04:23.890> is
