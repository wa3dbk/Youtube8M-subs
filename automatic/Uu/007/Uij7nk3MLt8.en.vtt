00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:12.690
 good guys saved me welcome to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.460
 second logical challenge and this time the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.410
 What happened was that I was traveling 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.420
 with three of your friends 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.609
 Your boat has shipwrecked you. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.390
 ended up on an island that had a group of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.160
 cannibals 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 this group of cannibals launched a challenge 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.300
 for you would only release you if you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.220
 pass the challenge 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.840
 What they did was the following 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.950
 they took you 4 and buried you to the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.640
 neck 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:50.850
 here on the floor then they put it here 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.489
 here and here you all facing 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.989
 the same side 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.989
 one looking at the nape of the other 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.129
 and here between these two guys they 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.129
 they put a wall 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.409
 so what happens they pick up and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.100
 they put on you 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 the hats they had four hats 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 two hats were black and two hats 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.210
 they were white and they put them in 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.210
 You, in this way, here 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:43.369
 so here we have a black hat and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.369
 here we have another black hat 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.360
 they put the hat on so that you can 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.910
 example if it was not this guy 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.370
 Can you see the color of your own hat? 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.630
 but you can see the color of that hat 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.820
 face in front of you 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.680
 this other guy can see the color 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.660
 these two hats here 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.790
 this one here because of the wall does not see anything 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.880
 and this one also does not see anything because it's 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.149
 looking forward to the challenge the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.390
 cannibals did then the following was a 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.600
 You have to hit the color of the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.360
 own hat who hit the color of the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.120
 own hat releases the whole group 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.700
 to leave but the cannibals will 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.220
 stay with you put you in the cauldron 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.460
 so here I am going to call more expensive 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.450
 of this baby here and say this and and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.430
 of d &amp; o challenge then tell me which 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.310
 these guys here could guess 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.200
 What was the color of the hat itself? 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 It's worth remembering here. 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.110
 You know there are two black and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.660
 two white but do not know the order that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.190
 they are placed so it 's released 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.810
 we will see the challenge again in the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.900
 comments that will achieve 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.070
 solve a hug there and even 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.070
 response to this challenge
