00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
earlier he's in the red zone for HP so

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.420 
earlier he's in the red zone for HP so
he's<00:03:33.660> probably<00:03:33.810> gonna<00:03:34.079> heal<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:35.250> I'm<00:03:35.310> just

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
that should knock him out in one head so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.960 
that should knock him out in one head so
I'm<00:03:38.910> not<00:03:39.000> too<00:03:39.209> worried<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:39.540> it

support<00:04:03.040> with<00:04:03.130> 46<00:04:03.670> not<00:04:03.940> bad<00:04:04.180> next<00:04:04.960> up<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.350> as

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
support with 46 not bad next up is as

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.350 
support with 46 not bad next up is as
Lyford<00:04:05.950> probably<00:04:06.340> as<00:04:06.460> easy<00:04:06.700> as<00:04:06.850> fel<00:04:07.030> c'mon<00:04:07.270> to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
Lyford probably as easy as fel c'mon to

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.410 
Lyford probably as easy as fel c'mon to
knockout<00:04:07.780> um<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.370> think<00:04:09.580> I'll<00:04:09.880> switch<00:04:10.150> over

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
knockout um so I think I'll switch over

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.370 
knockout um so I think I'll switch over
here<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.660> valve<00:04:11.290> Angela<00:04:11.830> um<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.960> all<00:04:14.260> the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
here to valve Angela um I have all the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.810 
here to valve Angela um I have all the
confidence<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.950> world<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.250> envoie<00:04:15.550> can

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
confidence in the world that envoie can

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.849 
confidence in the world that envoie can
knock<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:15.970> out<00:04:16.209> but<00:04:16.630> websphere<00:04:17.380> over<00:04:17.590> here

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
knock it out but websphere over here

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.800 
knock it out but websphere over here
it's<00:04:18.459> really<00:04:18.700> close<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> getting<00:04:19.180> up<00:04:19.420> a<00:04:19.510> level

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
it's really close to getting up a level

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.080 
it's really close to getting up a level
so<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.459> figured<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.489> should<00:04:21.519> take<00:04:21.790> care<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.030> that

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
so I figured I should take care of that

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.560 
so I figured I should take care of that
now<00:04:23.160> liepard<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.400> weak<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.790> fighting<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.360> bug

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
now liepard is weak to fighting and bug

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.050 
now liepard is weak to fighting and bug
it<00:04:25.780> knows<00:04:25.960> fake<00:04:26.350> outs<00:04:26.590> attract<00:04:27.160> aerial<00:04:27.730> ace<00:04:27.850> at

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
it knows fake outs attract aerial ace at

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.480 
it knows fake outs attract aerial ace at
night<00:04:28.240> /<00:04:28.570> um<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.650> also<00:04:29.770> has<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.160> limber

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
night / um it also has the limber

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.130 
night / um it also has the limber
ability<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.360> try<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.540> paralyze<00:04:32.110> it

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
ability so don't try to paralyze it

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.650 
ability so don't try to paralyze it
because<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.800> can<00:04:32.920> never<00:04:33.040> be<00:04:33.250> paralyzed<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.570> I'm

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
because it can never be paralyzed so I'm

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.790 
because it can never be paralyzed so I'm
just<00:04:34.750> gonna<00:04:34.840> go<00:04:35.050> ahead<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.290> use<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.410> signal

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
just gonna go ahead and use a signal

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.500 
just gonna go ahead and use a signal
beam<00:04:35.950> that's<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.220> super<00:04:36.520> effective<00:04:36.940> bug<00:04:37.180> Titan

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
beam that's a super effective bug Titan

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.930 
beam that's a super effective bug Titan
move<00:04:37.770> well<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.890> course<00:04:38.920> he<00:04:39.250> always<00:04:39.400> uses<00:04:39.610> fake

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
move well of course he always uses fake

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.330 
move well of course he always uses fake
outz<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.870> knowing<00:04:41.620> move<00:04:41.890> that<00:04:42.070> makes<00:04:42.220> you

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
outz it's a knowing move that makes you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.950 
outz it's a knowing move that makes you
flinch<00:04:42.640> automatically<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.540> always<00:04:43.690> goes

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
flinch automatically and it always goes

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.190 
flinch automatically and it always goes
first<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.590> can<00:04:44.740> only<00:04:44.860> use<00:04:45.040> it<00:04:45.160> once<00:04:46.200> so

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
first that you can only use it once so

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.330 
first that you can only use it once so
now<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.320> just<00:04:47.380> need<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.650> take<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:47.890> night<00:04:48.100> slash

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
now I just need to take this night slash

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.650 
now I just need to take this night slash
in<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.580> Sigma<00:04:48.910> beam<00:04:49.060> will<00:04:49.180> probably<00:04:49.510> take

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
in the Sigma beam will probably take

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.900 
in the Sigma beam will probably take
care<00:04:49.690> of<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.130> all<00:04:51.130> but<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:51.400> get<00:04:51.640> another

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
care of it all but you get another
