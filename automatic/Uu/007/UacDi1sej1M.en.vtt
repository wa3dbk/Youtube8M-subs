00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.150
 world of pixels 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.760
 is this stretch zote here all 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.060
 dog of the seas 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.920
 of years ago is a prehistoric shark 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.360
 and it is very famous because it measures 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.600
 too much it measures 21 and 6 meters 21 and 6 21 and 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.260
 6 meters high or if it is too much 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.970
 big danone did it in pixelar in 3-d 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.730
 and then we're going to record it because it's not 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.920
 he had recorded none of this these days 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.300
 it's been a while since danone has many 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.070
 constructions but also how it has 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.770
 your channel and things like that obviously not 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.300
 I can go to check it when I want 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.120
 or when he wants to because really 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.070
 we are busy but good band 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.850

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.019

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.700
 you do things like that if you have something 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.620
 seemed or something very much better I do not speak 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 of shark animals or something like that but 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.130
 check them as I did with danone yo 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.690

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.250
 subway they always give you subway 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.470
 boxes I have this one and they just have 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.229
 a little house of earth things like that why 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.080

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.830
 A) Yes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 danone, he always uploads Chinese things 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.520
 so I always believe that he does them 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 I've seen how he does them in fact I saw 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.759
 how Ferrari did things like that and so 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.130
 it was what a beautiful shark they see has the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320
 detail of the scales in the part of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.830
 down has some little fish that has 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.060
 there on the right side that accompany him 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.090
 in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.979
 in the world 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.210
 and that's what I tell the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.210
 I invite you to spend 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.920
 and go around all the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.910
