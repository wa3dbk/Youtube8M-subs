00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.310 
managed to pick it up for I think just
under<00:01:07.140> 100k<00:01:08.100> seeing<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.240> density<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> 40<00:01:10.140> k

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
under 100k seeing as the density is 40 k

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.960 
under 100k seeing as the density is 40 k
but<00:01:10.650> he<00:01:11.010> should<00:01:11.220> drop<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.880> the
