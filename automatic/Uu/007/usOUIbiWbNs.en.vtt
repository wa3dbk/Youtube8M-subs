that<00:01:34.950> Jesus<00:01:35.280> did<00:01:35.490> anyway<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.119> seemed

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that Jesus did anyway it seemed

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.080

unnecessary<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.369> he<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> kind<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
unnecessary and if he had that kind of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
unnecessary and if he had that kind of
super<00:01:40.079> secret<00:01:40.409> power

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
super secret power

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260 
super secret power
I<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.159> think<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> better<00:01:41.970> things
