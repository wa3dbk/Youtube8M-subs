that's<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> superficial<00:01:47.280> stuff

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that's just with the superficial stuff

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.660 
that's just with the superficial stuff
when<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.149> down<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.430> with<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
when we get down to it with all the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.389 
when we get down to it with all the
other<00:01:50.820> measurements<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> take<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.020> people

other measurements we can take on people

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
other measurements we can take on people
then<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.180> very<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.630> variable<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
then we really are very very variable I

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.249 
then we really are very very variable I
hope<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.759> real<00:01:57.329> success<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.110> this

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
hope that the real success of this

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.740 
hope that the real success of this
course<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> students

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
course is not just what the students

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.939 
course is not just what the students
will<00:02:00.930> learn<00:02:01.009> but<00:02:02.009> what<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> students<00:02:02.579> will<00:02:02.729> do
