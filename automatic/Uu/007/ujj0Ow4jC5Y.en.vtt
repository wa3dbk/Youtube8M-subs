method<00:00:07.180> and<00:00:07.330> this<00:00:08.080> is<00:00:08.230> our<00:00:08.320> goal<00:00:08.559> we<00:00:08.830> have<00:00:08.950> had

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
method and this is our goal we have had

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.820 
method and this is our goal we have had
already<00:00:09.370> had<00:00:09.669> to<00:00:09.790> cross<00:00:10.000> finish<00:00:10.389> from<00:00:10.830> cross

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
already had to cross finish from cross

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.430 
already had to cross finish from cross
part<00:00:12.429> obviously<00:00:12.969> and<00:00:13.809> now<00:00:14.080> we're<00:00:14.259> going<00:00:14.379> to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
part obviously and now we're going to

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.900 
part obviously and now we're going to
put<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.679> corners<00:00:15.039> in<00:00:15.190> place<00:00:15.370> and<00:00:15.610> as<00:00:15.700> you<00:00:15.789> can

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
put the corners in place and as you can

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.019 
put the corners in place and as you can
see<00:00:15.940> here<00:00:16.330> all<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:17.380> corners<00:00:17.740> are<00:00:17.949> in<00:00:18.789> place

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
see here all the corners are in place

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.179 
see here all the corners are in place
and<00:00:19.300> properly<00:00:19.630> oriented<00:00:19.990> that<00:00:20.349> is<00:00:20.500> like<00:00:20.710> we

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
and properly oriented that is like we

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.160 
and properly oriented that is like we
have<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.910> white<00:00:22.060> corner<00:00:22.390> in<00:00:22.449> here<00:00:22.630> with<00:00:22.869> red

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
have the white corner in here with red

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.310 
have the white corner in here with red
and<00:00:23.429> blue<00:00:24.429> matching<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.970> red<00:00:25.119> and<00:00:25.330> blue<00:00:25.599> sides

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
and blue matching the red and blue sides

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.950 
and blue matching the red and blue sides
so<00:00:26.920> for<00:00:27.609> example<00:00:27.699> in<00:00:28.119> incorrectly<00:00:28.720> placed

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
so for example in incorrectly placed

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.220 
so for example in incorrectly placed
corner<00:00:29.640> would<00:00:30.640> be<00:00:30.789> like<00:00:30.970> this<00:00:31.119> here<00:00:31.390> we<00:00:31.570> have

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
corner would be like this here we have

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.560 
corner would be like this here we have
the<00:00:32.470> it<00:00:33.400> fills<00:00:33.640> out<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.820> white<00:00:34.060> layer<00:00:34.270> has<00:00:34.540> a

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
the it fills out the white layer has a

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.630 
the it fills out the white layer has a
corner<00:00:35.050> but<00:00:35.680> it's<00:00:35.830> not<00:00:35.950> correctly<00:00:36.340> placed

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
corner but it's not correctly placed

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.680 
corner but it's not correctly placed
because<00:00:37.030> green<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:38.880> green<00:00:39.880> and<00:00:40.060> red<00:00:40.180> don't

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
because green and green and red don't

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.350 
because green and green and red don't
match<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.170> red<00:00:41.680> and<00:00:41.860> blue<00:00:42.100> sites<00:00:42.430> so<00:00:43.270> I'm

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
match the red and blue sites so I'm

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.200 
match the red and blue sites so I'm
going<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:43.510> go<00:00:43.600> ahead<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:43.930> take<00:00:44.110> those<00:00:44.320> out<00:00:44.590> so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
going to go ahead and take those out so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050 
going to go ahead and take those out so
I<00:00:46.210> just<00:00:46.300> sort<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.690> scramble<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:48.700> those<00:00:48.880> over

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
I just sort of scramble get those over

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.720 
I just sort of scramble get those over
there<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:50.320> should<00:00:50.470> be<00:00:50.560> good<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.580> yeah

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
there and that should be good so yeah

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.720 
there and that should be good so yeah
here<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:52.960> all<00:00:53.800> of<00:00:53.860> them<00:00:54.130> are<00:00:54.310> kind<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:54.580> in

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
here is all of them are kind of in

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.250 
here is all of them are kind of in
different<00:00:55.120> positions<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.870> now<00:00:56.020> we're<00:00:56.170> going

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
different positions and now we're going

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.440 
different positions and now we're going
to<00:00:56.320> look<00:00:56.410> around<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:57.220> see<00:00:57.250> what<00:00:57.610> what<00:00:58.210> we<00:00:58.330> can

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
to look around to see what what we can

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.620 
to look around to see what what we can
do<00:00:58.570> first<00:00:59.560> thing<00:00:59.740> again<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.190> this<00:01:01.030> top<00:01:01.420> layer

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
do first thing again is this top layer

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.330 
do first thing again is this top layer
is<00:01:01.690> going<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.110> be<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.230> buffer<00:01:02.410> layer<00:01:02.740> and<00:01:03.250> I'm

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
is going to be a buffer layer and I'm

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.770 
is going to be a buffer layer and I'm
going<00:01:03.400> to<00:01:03.550> look<00:01:03.640> around<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.210> top<00:01:04.420> buffer

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
going to look around in the top buffer

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.649 
going to look around in the top buffer
layer<00:01:04.960> for<00:01:05.619> any<00:01:06.219> corners<00:01:06.850> there<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.420> might

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
layer for any corners there that might

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.910 
layer for any corners there that might
already<00:01:07.840> be<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.200> there<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.500> we<00:01:08.590> have<00:01:08.710> three

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
already be in there and we have three

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.300 
already be in there and we have three
corners<00:01:09.450> easy<00:01:10.450> orange<00:01:10.990> green<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.799> orange<00:01:12.219> of

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
corners easy orange green the orange of

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.709 
corners easy orange green the orange of
blue<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:14.289> red<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:15.009> blue<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.539> nicest

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
blue and the red and blue and the nicest

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.389 
blue and the red and blue and the nicest
ones<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.200> easiest<00:01:17.530> ones<00:01:17.679> to<00:01:17.770> do<00:01:17.950> are<00:01:18.159> going<00:01:18.340> to

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
ones the easiest ones to do are going to

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.910 
ones the easiest ones to do are going to
be<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.609> ones<00:01:18.640> where<00:01:19.090> white<00:01:19.329> is<00:01:19.570> not<00:01:20.229> facing<00:01:20.560> up

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
be the ones where white is not facing up

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.080 
be the ones where white is not facing up
and<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.219> would<00:01:21.310> be<00:01:21.340> this<00:01:21.520> one<00:01:21.700> here<00:01:21.939> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and that would be this one here the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.300 
and that would be this one here the
orange<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.659> blue<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.499> all<00:01:24.039> we're<00:01:24.159> going<00:01:24.249> to

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
orange and blue and all we're going to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.060 
orange and blue and all we're going to
do<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.670> put<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.450> along<00:01:26.079> with<00:01:26.109> between<00:01:26.859> its

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
do is put that in along with between its

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.410 
do is put that in along with between its
two<00:01:27.729> cross<00:01:27.969> edges<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.590> we're<00:01:29.979> going<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.420> find

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
two cross edges so we're going to find

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.599 
two cross edges so we're going to find
out<00:01:31.600> which<00:01:31.749> place<00:01:32.499> it<00:01:32.710> belongs<00:01:33.009> in<00:01:33.219> which<00:01:33.460> is

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
out which place it belongs in which is

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.889 
out which place it belongs in which is
right<00:01:33.789> here<00:01:33.869> between<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.319> orange<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.280> blue

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
right here between the orange and blue

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.749 
right here between the orange and blue
you<00:01:37.899> can<00:01:38.049> see<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.229> there<00:01:38.530> we<00:01:38.649> go<00:01:38.770> I'm<00:01:39.549> going

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
you can see that there we go I'm going

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.480 
you can see that there we go I'm going
to<00:01:39.850> line<00:01:39.969> it<00:01:39.999> up<00:01:40.179> above<00:01:40.479> that<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:42.369> I'm

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
to line it up above that and then I'm

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.120 
to line it up above that and then I'm
going<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.729> move<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:43.450> away<00:01:43.569> or<00:01:44.200> rotate<00:01:44.979> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
going to move it away or rotate the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.209 
going to move it away or rotate the
buffer<00:01:45.399> layer<00:01:45.579> away<00:01:46.450> once<00:01:46.780> with<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.770> white<00:01:47.950> so

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
buffer layer away once with the white so

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.709 
buffer layer away once with the white so
with<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.399> whites<00:01:48.579> facing<00:01:48.969> this<00:01:49.090> way<00:01:49.149> I'm

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
with the whites facing this way I'm

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.169 
with the whites facing this way I'm
going<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.929> rotate<00:01:50.049> it<00:01:50.380> along<00:01:51.159> with<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.490> in

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
going to rotate it along with that in

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.149 
going to rotate it along with that in
this<00:01:52.329> case<00:01:52.569> it<00:01:52.719> would<00:01:52.810> be<00:01:52.899> clockwise<00:01:53.259> however

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
this case it would be clockwise however

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.590 
this case it would be clockwise however
if<00:01:54.249> white<00:01:54.460> was<00:01:54.609> facing<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:54.999> way<00:01:55.060> it'd<00:01:55.450> be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
if white was facing this way it'd be

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.999 
if white was facing this way it'd be
counterclockwise<00:01:56.109> so<00:01:56.649> I'm<00:01:56.740> going<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:56.889> rotate

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
counterclockwise so I'm going to rotate

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.459 
counterclockwise so I'm going to rotate
it<00:01:57.249> at<00:01:57.340> once<00:01:58.950> bring<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.549> opposite<00:02:01.450> edge<00:02:01.990> layer

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
it at once bring the opposite edge layer

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.160 
it at once bring the opposite edge layer
up<00:02:02.770> or<00:02:02.979> opposite<00:02:03.280> cross-layer<00:02:03.929> rotate<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.049> in

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
up or opposite cross-layer rotate it in

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.319 
up or opposite cross-layer rotate it in
and<00:02:05.380> turn<00:02:06.249> it<00:02:06.399> back<00:02:06.429> in<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:06.909> as<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.179> can<00:02:07.299> see

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
and turn it back in and as you can see

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.200 
and turn it back in and as you can see
here<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:08.319> formed<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.220> nice<00:02:09.430> little<00:02:09.700> pair<00:02:10.060> we

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
here it formed a nice little pair we

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.830 
here it formed a nice little pair we
have<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:12.030> white<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
have with the white and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.140 
have with the white and
cross<00:02:14.140> piece<00:02:14.410> as<00:02:14.620> well<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.640> corner<00:02:16.000> that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
cross piece as well as the corner that

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.479 
cross piece as well as the corner that
we're<00:02:16.269> going<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.569> then<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.110> do

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
we're going in then all we have to do

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.710 
we're going in then all we have to do
rotate<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.610> back<00:02:18.730> down<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.239> now<00:02:19.330> we<00:02:19.390> have<00:02:19.480> it

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
rotate it back down and now we have it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.150 
rotate it back down and now we have it
nice<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:21.340> place<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.440> conveniently<00:02:23.950> when

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
nice and in place and conveniently when

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.180 
nice and in place and conveniently when
we<00:02:24.280> did<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:25.390> turned<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:26.010> corner<00:02:27.010> piece

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
we did that it turned this corner piece

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.890 
we did that it turned this corner piece
here<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.790> white<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.030> facing<00:02:28.540> out<00:02:28.660> and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
here so that the white is facing out and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.979 
here so that the white is facing out and
this<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.230> exact<00:02:29.530> opposite<00:02:30.010> case<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
this is the exact opposite case it

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.619 
this is the exact opposite case it
belongs<00:02:32.410> over<00:02:32.769> here<00:02:33.190> instead<00:02:33.879> white<00:02:34.420> is

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
belongs over here instead white is

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.970 
belongs over here instead white is
facing<00:02:35.019> out<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.140> we're<00:02:35.349> going<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.530> rotate<00:02:35.709> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
facing out so we're going to rotate it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.199 
facing out so we're going to rotate it
on<00:02:36.099> once<00:02:36.599> can't<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.750> anti-clockwise<00:02:39.209> bring

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
on once can't the anti-clockwise bring

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.770 
on once can't the anti-clockwise bring
the<00:02:40.390> opposite<00:02:41.260> cross<00:02:41.650> edge<00:02:42.040> layer<00:02:42.400> up<00:02:42.760> put<00:02:43.690> it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the opposite cross edge layer up put it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.180 
the opposite cross edge layer up put it
back<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.790> rotate<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> back<00:02:46.060> down<00:02:46.269> simple<00:02:47.190> now

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
back in rotate it back down simple now

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.770 
back in rotate it back down simple now
when<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.760> white<00:02:49.000> facing<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:49.540> here

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
when you have white facing up here

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.390 
when you have white facing up here
you're<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:50.110> going<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.319> have<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:51.010> manipulate

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
you're just going to have to manipulate

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.089 
you're just going to have to manipulate
it<00:02:51.849> so<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:52.569> get<00:02:52.750> white<00:02:53.049> facing<00:02:53.590> out<00:02:53.769> one

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
it so that we get white facing out one

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.350 
it so that we get white facing out one
of<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> sides<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.670> that's<00:02:54.849> really<00:02:55.000> easy<00:02:55.150> to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
of the sides and that's really easy to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.440 
of the sides and that's really easy to
do<00:02:55.680> we're<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.769> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:56.980> put<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.250> above<00:02:58.180> an

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
do we're just going to put it above an

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.330 
do we're just going to put it above an
unfilled<00:02:59.230> corner<00:02:59.680> like<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:02.190> rotate<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
unfilled corner like so rotate the the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.930 
unfilled corner like so rotate the the
side<00:03:07.230> away<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:09.190> now<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.519> see<00:03:09.640> when<00:03:09.790> we

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
side away so now you can see when we

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.479 
side away so now you can see when we
rotated<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.450> away<00:03:10.750> white<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.769> now<00:03:11.920> facing<00:03:12.190> out

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
rotated it away white is now facing out

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.640 
rotated it away white is now facing out
the<00:03:13.090> side<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:14.019> we'll<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.290> move<00:03:14.379> it<00:03:14.530> out<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
the side and we'll just move it out of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.339 
the side and we'll just move it out of
the<00:03:14.769> way<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.579> rotate<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:15.940> back<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:17.110> here<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.319> go

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
the way and rotate it back so here we go

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.699 
the way and rotate it back so here we go
it<00:03:18.250> belongs<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:18.940> corner<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.470> we're<00:03:20.590> going

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
it belongs in this corner so we're going

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.970 
it belongs in this corner so we're going
to<00:03:20.880> put<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.000> above<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.420> rotate<00:03:23.230> out<00:03:23.380> once<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
to put it above it rotate out once the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420 
to put it above it rotate out once the
White<00:03:24.160> Way<00:03:24.959> bring<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.079> opposite<00:03:26.560> layer<00:03:27.160> up

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
White Way bring the opposite layer up

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.449 
White Way bring the opposite layer up
and<00:03:28.359> put<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.349> back<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:31.239> such<00:03:32.099> now<00:03:33.099> for<00:03:33.340> sake

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
and put it back in as such now for sake

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.440 
and put it back in as such now for sake
of<00:03:33.549> example<00:03:35.069> I'm<00:03:36.069> going<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.519> put<00:03:36.880> this<00:03:36.910> last

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
of example I'm going to put this last

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.110 
of example I'm going to put this last
edge<00:03:37.810> piece<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.440> improperly<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.519> say<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:39.940> had

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
edge piece in improperly so say you had

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.960 
edge piece in improperly so say you had
an<00:03:40.209> edge<00:03:40.329> piece<00:03:40.569> that's<00:03:40.780> already<00:03:41.019> in<00:03:41.170> place

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
an edge piece that's already in place

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.370 
an edge piece that's already in place
but<00:03:42.970> it's<00:03:43.060> not<00:03:43.120> correctly<00:03:43.690> oriented<00:03:43.930> or<00:03:44.230> it's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
but it's not correctly oriented or it's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.050 
but it's not correctly oriented or it's
in<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.560> wrong<00:03:44.919> place<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.609> got<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.880> get<00:03:45.940> it

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
in the wrong place so we got to get it

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.940 
in the wrong place so we got to get it
out<00:03:46.150> again<00:03:46.750> that's<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.139> easy<00:03:47.230> I'm<00:03:47.829> going

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
out again that's really easy I'm going

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.530 
out again that's really easy I'm going
to<00:03:48.040> rotate<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.489> up<00:03:48.639> so<00:03:48.849> it's<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.239> buffer

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
to rotate it up so it's in the buffer

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.569 
to rotate it up so it's in the buffer
layer<00:03:49.720> move<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.650> out<00:03:50.769> of<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.859> way<00:03:51.010> temporarily

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
layer move it out of the way temporarily

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.470 
layer move it out of the way temporarily
and<00:03:51.970> then<00:03:52.109> rotate<00:03:53.109> the<00:03:53.290> cross<00:03:53.709> part<00:03:54.040> back<00:03:54.220> down

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480
