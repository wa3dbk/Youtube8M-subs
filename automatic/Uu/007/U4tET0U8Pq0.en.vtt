think<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> cool<00:01:44.040> video<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.430> make

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
think that would be a cool video to make

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
think that would be a cool video to make
for<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.180> guys<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.229> sure<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.500> stay<00:01:46.770> tuned

for you guys so be sure to stay tuned

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.530 
for you guys so be sure to stay tuned
for<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.939> that'll<00:01:48.210> help<00:01:48.360> us

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
for that one because that'll help us

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840 
for that one because that'll help us
probably<00:01:49.020> down<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.530> long<00:01:49.710> road<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.640> once

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
probably down the long road and once

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.870 
probably down the long road and once
this<00:01:51.090> game<00:01:51.329> comes<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.409> anyway<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.520> map

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
this game comes out but anyway this map

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
this game comes out but anyway this map
not<00:01:54.390> we've<00:01:54.570> always<00:01:54.810> known<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.409> gonna<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.710> big

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
not we've always known it's gonna be big

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560 
not we've always known it's gonna be big
when<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.579> there's<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> train<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.360> know

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
when you know there's a train we know

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
when you know there's a train we know
that<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> lot<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> different

that it's there's a lot of different

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
that it's there's a lot of different
areas<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> map<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> way<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
areas of the map but just the way that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
areas of the map but just the way that
bordelles<00:02:01.890> saying<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.610> there's<00:02:03.000> back

for<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.099> map<00:02:11.280> I've<00:02:11.520> craved<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.660> city<00:02:12.959> map

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
for this map I've craved the city map

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
for this map I've craved the city map
where<00:02:13.689> you<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:13.930> go<00:02:14.110> inside<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.590> buildings<00:02:14.920> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
where you can go inside of buildings and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.670 
where you can go inside of buildings and
I've<00:02:15.519> nearly<00:02:16.000> every<00:02:16.420> buildings<00:02:16.780> open<00:02:17.019> that's

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
I've nearly every buildings open that's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440 
I've nearly every buildings open that's
what<00:02:17.950> I've<00:02:18.069> wanted<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.670> long<00:02:18.730> time<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.209> it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
what I've wanted for a long time and it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.850 
what I've wanted for a long time and it
looks<00:02:19.689> like<00:02:19.900> that's<00:02:20.019> sort<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:20.739> we're

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
looks like that's sort of what we're

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.069 
looks like that's sort of what we're
getting<00:02:20.950> there's<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.340> bar<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.640> screen<00:02:22.180> now<00:02:22.450> so

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
getting there's a bar on screen now so

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.780 
getting there's a bar on screen now so
we're<00:02:23.530> gonna<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.799> tons<00:02:24.129> of<00:02:24.250> different<00:02:24.400> rooms

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
we're gonna get tons of different rooms

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.420 
we're gonna get tons of different rooms
I'm<00:02:25.420> thinking<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.079> this<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.769> don't<00:02:27.250> really

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.890 
I'm thinking of this like I don't really
know<00:02:27.640> how<00:02:27.700> I'm<00:02:27.849> picturing<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.329> but<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.599> sounds

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900
