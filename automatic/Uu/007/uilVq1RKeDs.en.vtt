application first we'll start off with

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.200

contacts<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.740> cool<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.280> about<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.790> app

that we saw so far is the contact screen

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.179 
that we saw so far is the contact screen
looks<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.869> similar<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.040> regular

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
looks very similar to the regular

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
looks very similar to the regular
address<00:01:15.000> book<00:01:15.330> within<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> iphone

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
address book within the iphone

address book within the iphone
application<00:01:17.400> itself<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.210> pretty

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
application itself and that's pretty

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.760 
application itself and that's pretty
cool<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.229> don't<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> learn

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

anything<00:01:20.330> we're<00:01:21.330> learning<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.900> new<00:01:22.170> program

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
anything we're learning a new program

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980 
anything we're learning a new program
it's<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> feel<00:01:23.670> very<00:01:23.970> familiar<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's going to feel very familiar to you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
it's going to feel very familiar to you
and<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.560> basically<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> iphone

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and that's basically where the iphone

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
and that's basically where the iphone
has<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.960> spades<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.770> people<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.399 
has it in spades because people like to
do<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> same<00:01:30.450> thing<00:01:30.780> they're<00:01:31.020> used<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
do the same thing they're used to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
do the same thing they're used to
pinching<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> zooming<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.700> scrolling<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
pinching and zooming and scrolling and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
pinching and zooming and scrolling and
and<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.170> contacts<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> top<00:01:35.220> producer

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and the contacts and the top producer

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
and the contacts and the top producer
devices<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.900> similar<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.590> you're

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
devices is very similar to what you're

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
devices is very similar to what you're
used<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.220> doing<00:01:38.340> swiping<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.299> contact

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
used to doing swiping down the contact

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.530 
used to doing swiping down the contact
lists<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.250> pretty<00:01:41.520> great<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.970> we

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
lists so that's pretty great if we

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.200 
lists so that's pretty great if we
actually<00:01:43.110> click<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> particular<00:01:44.210> contact

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
actually click on a particular contact

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
application too and of course it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.949 
application too and of course it
wouldn't<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.850> true<00:02:48.880> application<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:49.840> you

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
wouldn't be a true application if you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.810 
wouldn't be a true application if you
couldn't<00:02:50.260> schedule<00:02:50.680> items<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.400> schedule

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
appointments and calls and to dues so

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.100 
appointments and calls and to dues so
it's<00:02:54.790> very<00:02:54.910> easy<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.300> do<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.660> as<00:02:55.750> well<00:02:55.780> it's

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
it's very easy to do that as well it's

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110 
it's very easy to do that as well it's
very<00:02:56.230> similar<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.860> iphone<00:02:57.120> application
