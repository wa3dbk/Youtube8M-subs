they<00:04:52.050> could<00:04:52.199> have<00:04:52.289> at<00:04:52.470> least<00:04:52.770> done<00:04:53.039> two

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
they could have at least done two

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.120 
they could have at least done two
versions<00:04:53.879> of<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.180> video<00:04:54.360> at<00:04:54.840> least<00:04:55.169> more

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
versions of this video at least more

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.719 
versions of this video at least more
like<00:04:56.310> four<00:04:56.639> five<00:04:57.440> also<00:04:58.440> seeing<00:04:59.099> all<00:04:59.430> the

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
like four five also seeing all the

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.180 
like four five also seeing all the
editing<00:05:00.240> now<00:05:00.960> we<00:05:01.020> know<00:05:01.349> how<00:05:01.710> they<00:05:01.889> managed<00:05:02.159> to

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
editing now we know how they managed to

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.149 
editing now we know how they managed to
corrupt<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:03.599> video<00:05:03.930> files<00:05:04.289> because<00:05:04.830> if<00:05:05.039> you

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
corrupt the video files because if you

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.939 
corrupt the video files because if you
could<00:05:05.460> if<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:06.569> put<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:06.900> many<00:05:07.110> filters<00:05:07.380> and

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
could if you put so many filters and

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.740 
could if you put so many filters and
effects<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.699> this<00:05:08.819> and<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.389> a<00:05:09.479> video

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
effects and this and that and a video

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.770 
effects and this and that and a video
that<00:05:10.680> could<00:05:10.949> happen<00:05:11.180> they<00:05:12.180> they<00:05:12.419> had<00:05:12.569> all

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
that could happen they they had all

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.200 
that could happen they they had all
those<00:05:12.960> different<00:05:13.610> scenes<00:05:14.610> but<00:05:14.880> they<00:05:14.969> didn't

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
those different scenes but they didn't

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.969

really<00:05:15.389> follow<00:05:15.539> through<00:05:16.139> with<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:16.770> they

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
really follow through with it so they

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.040
