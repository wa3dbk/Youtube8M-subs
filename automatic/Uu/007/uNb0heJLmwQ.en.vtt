Ridgewood Queens and today we're going

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.180 
Ridgewood Queens and today we're going
to<00:00:09.420> talk<00:00:09.570> about<00:00:09.769> exercises<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.950> strengthen

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
to talk about exercises to strengthen

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.509 
to talk about exercises to strengthen
the<00:00:11.519> subscapularis<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.130> subscapularis<00:00:14.130> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the subscapularis so subscapularis is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.120 
the subscapularis so subscapularis is
one<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> rotator<00:00:16.049> cuff<00:00:16.139> muscles<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.949> one

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
one of the rotator cuff muscles it's one

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.590 
one of the rotator cuff muscles it's one
of<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> most<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.060> most<00:00:18.240> powerful

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of the most it's the most powerful

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590 
of the most it's the most powerful
rotator<00:00:19.080> cuff<00:00:19.289> muscle<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.730> mostly<00:00:21.359> is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
rotator cuff muscle and it mostly is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
rotator cuff muscle and it mostly is
involved<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.260> medial<00:00:22.650> rotation<00:00:22.830> which<00:00:23.369> is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
involved with medial rotation which is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.029 
involved with medial rotation which is
basically<00:00:23.850> rotation<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> humerus<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.289> so

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
basically rotation of the humerus in so

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:26.900 
basically rotation of the humerus in so
today<00:00:26.250> we're<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.760> exercises

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
today we're going to do two exercises

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.419 
today we're going to do two exercises
both<00:00:27.750> exercises<00:00:28.260> involve<00:00:28.619> using<00:00:28.859> resistance

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
both exercises involve using resistance

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
both exercises involve using resistance
bands<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.390> any<00:00:30.599> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> resistance

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
bands you can use any kind of resistance

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.020 
bands you can use any kind of resistance
band<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> flat<00:00:32.279> kind<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
band they can be the flat kind or the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
band they can be the flat kind or the
round<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.020> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.350> handles<00:00:34.739> or

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
round kind the kind of handles or

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.889 
round kind the kind of handles or
whatever<00:00:35.100> works<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:36.120> long<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.780> at

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
whatever works as long as you have it at

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.930 
whatever works as long as you have it at
an<00:00:36.989> appropriate<00:00:37.440> angle<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> hooked<00:00:38.790> up

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
an appropriate angle and and hooked up

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
an appropriate angle and and hooked up
properly<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.620> an<00:00:40.710> exercise<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
properly you can do an exercise for the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.910 
properly you can do an exercise for the
subscapularis<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> first<00:00:43.050> exercise<00:00:43.200> is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
subscapularis so the first exercise is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
subscapularis so the first exercise is
medial<00:00:44.670> rotations<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> medial

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
medial rotations with the medial

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.080 
medial rotations with the medial
rotation<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.350> need<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.219> need<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> van<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
rotation you need you need the van to be

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.470 
rotation you need you need the van to be
set<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.649> somewhere<00:00:49.649> that's<00:00:50.210> parallel<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
set up somewhere that's parallel to the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.170 
set up somewhere that's parallel to the
floor<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.530> perpendicular<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.850> arm

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
floor or or perpendicular to your arm

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
floor or or perpendicular to your arm
or<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> humerus<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
or to the humerus what you're going to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.260 
or to the humerus what you're going to
do<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> position<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> bent

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
do from that position is with the bent

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.119 
do from that position is with the bent
elbows<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> elbows<00:00:58.020> bent<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.320> 90<00:00:58.530> degrees<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
elbows the elbows bent at 90 degrees you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
elbows the elbows bent at 90 degrees you
rip<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> bend<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.629> rotate

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
rip the bend and you just rotate

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.280 
rip the bend and you just rotate
internally<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.070> rotate<00:01:02.430> inside<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.510> then

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
internally or rotate inside and then

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
internally or rotate inside and then
extend<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:04.920> out<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.610> don't<00:01:05.760> want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> use

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
extend it back out you don't want to use

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
extend it back out you don't want to use
too<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.420> resistance<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.260> doing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
too much resistance when you're doing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
too much resistance when you're doing
this<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> use<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> nice<00:01:08.430> reasonable

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this you want to use a nice reasonable

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
this you want to use a nice reasonable
resistance<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> feel<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.830> not

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
resistance something you feel but not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
resistance something you feel but not
something<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.850> strain<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.330> get

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
something that you have to strain to get

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
something that you have to strain to get
the<00:01:12.750> rotator<00:01:13.290> cuff<00:01:13.380> exercises<00:01:13.650> especially

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the rotator cuff exercises especially

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.270 
the rotator cuff exercises especially
this<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.240> meant<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.860> control<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this one is really meant to control and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
this one is really meant to control and
not<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.570> heavy<00:01:18.750> weights<00:01:19.080> it's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
not to do it with heavy weights it's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
not to do it with heavy weights it's
also<00:01:19.710> important<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:20.280> doing<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
also important when you're doing this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
also important when you're doing this
not<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.330> free<00:01:21.509> weights<00:01:21.720> because

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
not to do it with free weights because

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
not to do it with free weights because
gravity<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.890> pulling<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> free<00:01:23.520> weight

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
gravity is pulling the free weight

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
gravity is pulling the free weight
straight<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> get

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
straight down you're not going to get

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
straight down you're not going to get
the<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.830> resistance<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> really

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the kind of resistance that you really

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
the kind of resistance that you really
need<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> work<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> subscapularis<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.829> you're

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
need to work the subscapularis if you're

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.109 
need to work the subscapularis if you're
using<00:01:29.100> free<00:01:29.340> weights<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.880> need<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
using free weights and really need to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
using free weights and really need to
tap<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> band<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> needs<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.680> attached<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
tap a band and needs to be attached to a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700 
tap a band and needs to be attached to a
wall<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:33.450> second<00:01:33.869> exercise<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
wall the second exercise is going to be

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.080 
wall the second exercise is going to be
with<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> band<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> band<00:01:35.400> needs<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.970> be

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
