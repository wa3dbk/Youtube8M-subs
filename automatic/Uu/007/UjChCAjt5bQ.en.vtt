 that the opponents have taken to win the tournament 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.090
 I iguana the prize is why in 10 thousand euros is the first time in Spain 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.659
 an initiative of this is made this type 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.070
 Up to two tournaments always had gifts 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.620
 based on peripherals to play in video games trips etcetera but what 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.880
 we want with this is that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.690
 There are professionals in this sector like her in China and Korea 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 or in the United States 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.960
 because the truth is that the estimate we have is very high because as you 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.690
 This is the first time that this type of initiative has been carried out and the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.410
 truth is that the franchise pulled 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.620
 is the most anti-the-most-powerful franchise in the videogame world 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.330

 why all these events have happened in the past leave it all 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.799
 those green pans of this franchise will be able to discover 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.999
 that arose between covenants and unesco because well the conflict is that 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.999
