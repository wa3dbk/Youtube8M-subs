00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
finished game to be honest he's got the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.160 
finished game to be honest he's got the
squads<00:01:15.160> in<00:01:15.369> there<00:01:15.550> we've<00:01:16.479> even<00:01:16.630> got<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.990> EA

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170

loading<00:01:17.649> screens<00:01:18.000> except<00:01:19.000> it's<00:01:19.240> instead<00:01:20.020> of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
loading screens except it's instead of

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.359 
loading screens except it's instead of
us<00:01:20.229> looking<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.740> they'll<00:01:20.890> probably<00:01:21.100> sound

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
us looking in they'll probably sound

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.800

like<00:01:21.520> you've<00:01:21.700> disconnected<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.630> EA

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
like you've disconnected to the EA

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.310 
like you've disconnected to the EA
servers<00:01:23.080> or<00:01:23.649> something<00:01:23.920> dumb<00:01:24.160> but<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.330> finger

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
servers or something dumb but I finger

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.139 
servers or something dumb but I finger
looks<00:01:26.500> absolutely<00:01:27.130> it's<00:01:27.520> probably<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:27.970> best

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
looks absolutely it's probably the best

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.990 
looks absolutely it's probably the best
