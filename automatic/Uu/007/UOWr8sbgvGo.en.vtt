00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.559 
than adequate so let's pop all of this
to<00:04:00.569> one<00:04:00.720> side<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.259> we<00:04:01.319> have<00:04:02.159> a<00:04:02.400> closer<00:04:02.939> look<00:04:03.120> at

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
to one side and we have a closer look at

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.479 
to one side and we have a closer look at
the<00:04:04.310> qx30<00:04:05.310> itself<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:07.290> here<00:04:07.709> we<00:04:07.859> go<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.340> it

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
the qx30 itself and here we go and it

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.050 
the qx30 itself and here we go and it
really<00:04:08.790> does<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.870> look<00:04:10.139> like<00:04:10.379> a<00:04:10.620> lens<00:04:11.060> so

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
really does just look like a lens so

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.670 
really does just look like a lens so
we've<00:04:12.180> got<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.329> little<00:04:12.479> tag<00:04:12.870> here<00:04:13.199> which<00:04:13.650> just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
we've got a little tag here which just

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.210 
we've got a little tag here which just
tells<00:04:14.220> us<00:04:14.370> about<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.790> being<00:04:14.970> Wi-Fi<00:04:15.689> and<00:04:15.930> NFC<00:04:16.220> so

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
tells us about it being Wi-Fi and NFC so

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.339 
tells us about it being Wi-Fi and NFC so
we<00:04:17.310> can<00:04:17.519> pair<00:04:17.789> this<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.000> really<00:04:18.509> easily

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
we can pair this up really easily

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.149 
we can pair this up really easily
let's<00:04:19.889> just<00:04:20.220> get<00:04:20.459> my<00:04:20.930> knife<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.320> we<00:04:22.710> shall<00:04:22.979> get

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
let's just get my knife and we shall get

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:29.369 
let's just get my knife and we shall get
rid<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.639> so<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:24.960> in<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.440> way

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:33.010 

there<00:04:30.379> we<00:04:30.560> go<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.009> then<00:04:31.159> this<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:32.020> qx30

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
there we go and then this is the qx30

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.580 
there we go and then this is the qx30
itself<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.949> really<00:04:34.639> nice<00:04:34.969> looking<00:04:35.419> device<00:04:35.779> it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
itself a really nice looking device it

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.459 
itself a really nice looking device it
does<00:04:36.889> look<00:04:37.249> very<00:04:37.460> very<00:04:37.789> good<00:04:38.210> indeed<00:04:38.659> so<00:04:39.319> we've

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
does look very very good indeed so we've

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.420 
does look very very good indeed so we've
got<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.800> Sony<00:04:40.159> lens<00:04:40.759> G<00:04:41.889> marking<00:04:42.889> on<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.189> front

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
got the Sony lens G marking on the front

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.860 
got the Sony lens G marking on the front
here<00:04:43.580> thirty<00:04:43.909> times<00:04:44.240> optical<00:04:44.749> zoom<00:04:44.779> F<00:04:45.520> 3.5<00:04:46.520> to

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
6.3 and then round on this side here we

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.050 
6.3 and then round on this side here we
have<00:04:51.590> got<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.889> little<00:04:52.219> cover<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.789> this<00:04:52.879> is

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
have got a little cover and this is

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.969 
have got a little cover and this is
where<00:04:53.270> we're<00:04:53.479> going<00:04:53.659> to<00:04:53.779> put<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.199> microSD

where we're going to put the microSD

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.369 
where we're going to put the microSD
card<00:04:55.279> or<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.699> memory<00:04:55.909> stick<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.509> a<00:04:56.960> little

on the bottom we've got a tripod mount
very<00:05:39.080> very<00:05:39.529> useful<00:05:40.099> because<00:05:40.219> that<00:05:40.580> means<00:05:40.759> not

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
very very useful because that means not

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.269 
very very useful because that means not
only<00:05:41.599> can<00:05:41.779> we<00:05:41.810> sit<00:05:42.169> this<00:05:42.319> on<00:05:42.500> objects<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:43.099> take

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
only can we sit this on objects to take

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.670 
only can we sit this on objects to take
photos<00:05:43.789> but<00:05:44.330> we<00:05:44.419> can<00:05:44.569> also<00:05:44.719> mount<00:05:45.229> it<00:05:45.439> on<00:05:45.649> a

photos but we can also mount it on a

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.129 
photos but we can also mount it on a
standard<00:05:46.250> tripod<00:05:46.669> mount<00:05:47.149> very<00:05:47.629> very<00:05:47.899> cool

standard tripod mount very very cool

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.469 
standard tripod mount very very cool
indeed<00:05:48.259> then<00:05:49.009> on<00:05:49.159> the<00:05:49.219> back<00:05:49.430> here<00:05:49.729> we've<00:05:50.240> got

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
indeed then on the back here we've got

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.350 
indeed then on the back here we've got
the<00:05:51.199> portion<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:52.099> we<00:05:52.250> can<00:05:52.430> undo<00:05:52.879> this<00:05:53.060> cover

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
the portion that we can undo this cover

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.110 
the portion that we can undo this cover
and<00:05:53.659> actually<00:05:54.349> put<00:05:54.770> the<00:05:54.889> battery<00:05:55.339> in<00:05:55.490> very

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
and actually put the battery in very

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.600 
and actually put the battery in very
very<00:05:56.419> nice<00:05:56.629> indeed<00:05:56.899> I<00:05:57.259> like<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.069> fact<00:05:58.279> that

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
very nice indeed I like the fact that

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.559 
very nice indeed I like the fact that
the<00:05:59.240> battery<00:06:00.080> cover<00:06:00.770> is<00:06:01.310> separate<00:06:02.000> to<00:06:02.180> the

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
the battery cover is separate to the

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.689 
the battery cover is separate to the
memory<00:06:02.899> card<00:06:02.930> like<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:03.889> a<00:06:03.919> lot<00:06:04.129> because<00:06:04.279> even

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
memory card like that a lot because even

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.700 
memory card like that a lot because even
some<00:06:05.080> higher-end<00:06:07.029> cameras<00:06:08.029> have<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:09.050> battery

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
some higher-end cameras have the battery

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.980 
some higher-end cameras have the battery
compartment<00:06:10.430> shared<00:06:11.120> with<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.419> memory<00:06:11.750> card

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
compartment shared with the memory card

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.050 
compartment shared with the memory card
slot<00:06:12.319> and<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.560> don't<00:06:12.919> like<00:06:13.129> that<00:06:13.399> so<00:06:13.849> at<00:06:13.909> least

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
slot and I don't like that so at least

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.659 
slot and I don't like that so at least
if<00:06:14.270> this<00:06:14.389> is<00:06:14.509> on<00:06:14.599> a<00:06:14.629> tripod<00:06:15.020> and<00:06:15.469> the<00:06:16.159> battery

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
if this is on a tripod and the battery

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.950 
if this is on a tripod and the battery
runs<00:06:16.849> out<00:06:17.000> you<00:06:17.120> can<00:06:17.240> change<00:06:17.449> the<00:06:17.569> battery

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
runs out you can change the battery

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.929 
runs out you can change the battery
memory<00:06:18.319> card<00:06:18.560> runs<00:06:18.800> out<00:06:19.009> you<00:06:19.279> can<00:06:19.490> change<00:06:19.789> the

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:19.939 
memory card runs out you can change the

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.450 
memory card runs out you can change the
memory<00:06:20.210> card<00:06:20.449> if<00:06:20.659> you<00:06:20.839> so<00:06:21.080> wish<00:06:21.319> so<00:06:22.129> that<00:06:22.159> is

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
memory card if you so wish so that is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.240 
memory card if you so wish so that is
that<00:06:22.699> is<00:06:22.759> it<00:06:23.000> this<00:06:23.240> is<00:06:23.509> the<00:06:23.539> sony<00:06:24.250> cybershot

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
that is it this is the sony cybershot

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.809 
that is it this is the sony cybershot
DSC<00:06:26.080> qx30<00:06:27.080> it's<00:06:27.469> got<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:28.159> also<00:06:28.520> got<00:06:28.699> the

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
DSC qx30 it's got the also got the

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.730 
DSC qx30 it's got the also got the
optical<00:06:29.300> steadyshot<00:06:29.599> in<00:06:30.139> it<00:06:30.229> as<00:06:30.349> well<00:06:30.500> so

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
optical steadyshot in it as well so

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.769 
optical steadyshot in it as well so
we've<00:06:30.860> got<00:06:30.979> optical<00:06:31.460> image<00:06:31.759> stabilization<00:06:32.180> I

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
we've got optical image stabilization I

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.139 
we've got optical image stabilization I
think<00:06:33.439> it<00:06:33.529> looks<00:06:33.710> really<00:06:34.219> nice<00:06:34.370> it<00:06:34.699> feels<00:06:34.940> very

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:35.149 
think it looks really nice it feels very

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:37.089 
think it looks really nice it feels very
very<00:06:35.629> well<00:06:35.870> built<00:06:36.110> don't<00:06:36.740> forget<00:06:36.949> there's

also the qx1 just come out in the
x1<00:06:39.530> is<00:06:39.620> very<00:06:39.800> slightly<00:06:40.130> different<00:06:40.550> this<00:06:40.670> has

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
x1 is very slightly different this has

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.760 
x1 is very slightly different this has
got<00:06:41.000> the<00:06:41.150> lens<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.690> everything<00:06:41.990> built<00:06:42.290> into
