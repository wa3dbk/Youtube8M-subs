00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.540
 the education system is made for a 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.200
 medium and the child douai and gold of 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.010
 this average 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.130
 I have a lot of trouble adapting because 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.530
 that his pace of thinking a lot more 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.900
 quick 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.580
 so he's bored but with all the 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.010
 negative consequences that it can have 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.750
 because he understands quickly and when he 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 will repeat and repeat several times 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.710
 something he picks up but after he 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.420
 got off the hook so he did not he missed the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 which is new and at the same time 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.360
 it's an impression of trampling 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.430
 they have no pleasure 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.500
 he has this intellectual curiosity that 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.150
 is not enough to power it's 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.870
 someone who was starving 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.700
 would give a tiny sofa with a 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.590
 fine or a peanut to eat then 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.540
 that they are starving it's not 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.299
 Satisfying this state of satisfaction 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.880
 Total 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.380
 the gene as well as children who are 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.760
 slower are not good at all 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 school no longer because they have 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.689
 always feel like trying to 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.630
 run desperately behind others 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.600
 and their image is all damaged and the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.920
 children who are very fast their image 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.590
 is not good either because we say 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.409
 they are agitated or dream that they 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.340
 go to sleep one does not necessarily identify 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.340
 the intellectual back 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.970
 the gifted kids are really 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.960
 characterized by a writing 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.100
 catastrophic it is often the only 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.530
 black dot in class 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.330
 there are several reasons they are 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.360
 perfectionists so they are 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.670
 completely appalled to see that this 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 that they write is so ugly then 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.520
 that mistress and clichy but a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.709
 table they would like right now 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.750
 write like that but they have a hand 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.270
 who is tense then more it goes more 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.520
 crispe and if they are told pay attention 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.230
 we make efforts exercises 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.530
 so that's the absolute catastrophe 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.320
 they are slow they do not trust 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.170
 finally there they are paralyzed with a 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.120
 pencil in hand and I advocate to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.239
 to make the sisters as quickly as possible 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.160
 grace therapies g of screw 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.819
 lectures a therapist who has 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 explained that sometimes the simple balance sheet 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.709
 was enough to explain to a child 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.920
 how to be how to approach 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.800
 the writing is explained to him why his 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.910
 lifted so difficult and it's his 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.650
 worries subside 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.360
 all gifted children are very fast 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.970
 worried they know they are 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.170
 terrified very quickly especially when she 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.370
 it's something they do not master 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.750
 no and there they do not understand a 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.549
 control over at all this me 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.040
 completely absurd 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.150
 and when we explain to them that we 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.070
 give them advice 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.720
 so here everything goes in the order is 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.060
 miraculously from anvils this balance sheet 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.400
 sometimes enough or so a few sessions 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.440
 are enough and the graphotherapist are 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.610
 rather driven because by force 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.970
 things she sees mostly kids 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.970
 gifted 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.410
 it is often said that gifted children 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.460
 are often seen dyslexic that the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.020
 others so I'm not sure because 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.250
 that gifted kids or are sometimes 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.860
 extremely fast 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.280
 they have a thought so fast that 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.620
 they go too fast and in this case they 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.040
 are staggered on Thursday custom a hitch where 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.350
 each horse well ready at his own pace 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.209
 it goes in all directions it gives a 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.600
 appearance of dyslexia but that is not 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.700
 no one tells them for example for 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.870
 the writing dictates them diktat to hand they 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.850
 make spelling mistakes that are 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.070
 able to correct mandic diktat to 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.480
 hand thinking goes a lot faster than 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.830
 the hand they write is important 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.310
 what to think about it are three months in 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.120
 advanced 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.060
 reading is the same that slips too much 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.440
 quickly they jump words and the method 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.220
 overall for that is absolutely 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.950
 catastrophic because he guesses there 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.150
 guess the words they know the text 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.200
 by heart they hear once they 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.960
 know by heart names that can 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.030
 pretend to read in feast he recites 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.850
 the book for gave them to lyon 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.280
 they know it parker it does not show 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.600
 and anyway the overall amount is 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.720
 catastrophic for everyone 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.080
 all the studies that were done at 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.310
 this point shows that it is not 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.720
 with the good part of the brain that 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.700
 learns to read there must be at the 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.790
 times learning the letters of 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.810
 acute sounds sense then that's really 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.419
 unfortunate because children 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.460
 loved to read and are deprived of 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.820
 this pleasure by teaching them by the 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.640
 global method where he had too much 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.650
 tiring to say and if someone is a little 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.020
 dyslexic I saw adults who is 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.370
 a little dyslexic in lizard they have 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.430
 learned by the global method 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.530
 we did not do anything and they were in check 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.320
 and they have a professional life of 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.280
 unsatisfactory only because of 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.540
 that then by the way I told you 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.160
 that he had no more than in the 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.470
 global population but it shows more 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.060
 late we think it gives the exchange the 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.960
 dyslexic children really that there are 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.130
 still gives the change and it does not 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.060
 not see right away they compensated 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.740
 it shows when they are in college 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:45.550
 but in the primary it is not seen 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.570
 and whose overall method therefore the 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.860
 consequences and there are also children 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.480
 as in the general population 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.889
 in orientation difficulties in 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.990
 space they have a bad 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.370
 representation in the space of 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.100
 first signs when they are young 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.480
 they do not have trouble learning to 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.510
 read the time they confuse 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.040
 the location of the churches struggling to get 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.860
 spot in time and confused yesterday 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.470
 the day before yesterday tomorrow and when they have this 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.430
 delay saborio tation in space and 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.310
 in time 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.990
 it's already a first clue it does not pass 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.580
 not form our mental presentation 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:26.530
 a clear situation it mixes 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:28.570
 and there it may be difficult to read 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.450
 because they reverse but it's not 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.550
 badly gets tired and dyslexia is reversed 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.440
 they can not fully understand the 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.850
 meaning but it's mostly in arithmetic 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.720
 they confuse additions subtractions 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.310
 they are same and here it can be these 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.440
 orientation difficulties in space 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.700
 it can be too fast but not 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.890
 more than in the general population 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.020
 lose speed no it's really clean 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:53.070
 gifted child but for the rest it's not 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.070
 more than in the general population
