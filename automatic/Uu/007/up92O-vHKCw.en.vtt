00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and welcome to kaiser 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 st 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.559
 Today I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.620
 rc Bobbycar thus building a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.020
 remote-controlled bobbycar with caravan 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.500
 Traders as a basis, we take the kiosk 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.500
 magforce foul 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.490
 we take the magforce ve cruiser because 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 on it really the bobbycar absolutely 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.440
 I agree with you recommend the new 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.870
 bobbycar to take the big new bobbycar 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.360
 you see that already behind the 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.379
 small croissant at most the back of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.410
 bobbycar's turn 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.540
 They are absolutely accurate on the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.850
 shortened as if you prefer the wibag 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.770
 cuts at the place where this cross strut 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 again it is a great 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.690
 protection from the back and the front fits that 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.660
 also very good with the nose 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.199
 that is an absolute protection for the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.300
 front axle of magforce and sees 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.180
 also good and of course 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.880
 just fits the wheelbase of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.740
 Piaggio kiquio already made exclusively 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.770
 So of course, the metro 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 of course it fits my sake 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.340
 also exactly under the new 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.619
 bobbycar so you just screw those 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.410
 wheels and steering and everything from that 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.929
 bobbycar and then mark you 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.330
 Just cut the clipping with one 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.300
 good felt pen with an edding or 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.800
 something and that you everywhere like that 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.740
 one to two centimeters from the edge 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.479
 away you go as long and distinguished 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.550
 of course, as I said, front and back 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.270
 these croissants or the front of the 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.220
 bumper records her with so so 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.470
 you can see that from above 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.590
 Opel goes so then can you all 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.179
 in the middle of the rotation with a separating disc 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.649
 cut out roughly and then 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.420
 You can then either again afterwards 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.819
 with a sanding tower of trimmel 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.349
 tackle or with emery paper or 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.430
 with a file or whatever and 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.200
 that a bit finer 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.209
 and that's how it looks on everyone 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.190
 then fall out of it leave the back 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.050
 croissants on the front of the bumper on it 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.090
 and son everywhere 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.430
 that makes it a bit more stable 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.720
 if you load the edge and you do you 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.060
 not every time you do it 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.380
 taking hold of it and then you do 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.600
 following the original body holder 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.080
 you just extend that with one 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.120
 pieces of rubber hose 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.650
 and you have to go and see her 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 This rubber hose always either in 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.320
 aquarium accessories in the zoo or 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.600
 in the hardware store and then you take the the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.850
 about it fits on the small 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.290
 Granules from the body could carrier 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.010
 make then again firmly 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.870
 sprint 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.330
 I have such a little one there 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.830
 cross rod done so easy 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.100
 the fender a bit on 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.530
 lie makes it all the more stable and 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.110
 then you make holes in the bobbycar 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.730
 a where then just these rubber hoses 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.060
 how prolonged body age 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.750
 rausgucken and thus the whole thing 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.400
 is you taking her here so small 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.200
 homemade pins and that's it 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.150
 just a screw with two 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.820
 bigger mother on a small the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.470
 then finally share 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.600
 Washer and the whole fits then 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.160
 with the mother so tight in the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.200
 rubber tube that it just like 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.680
 small stuff from above the whole 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.680
 holds 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.720
 if you still want to grow leds 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.790
 then you can look at ebay there 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.790
 it this kfz led stripes or strips and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.200
 you just lead them together and 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.780
 can then directly on the lido 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.790
 close the run so on 12 volt so 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.739
 two or three of it lipus work there 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.500
 and I did it that way now 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.890
 have the whole here the cable with a 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.180
 let lido come from the socket and in front 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.739
 I have a small on the leds 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.269
 plug it done then I can do that 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.670
 namely at any time reduce 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.709
 since I swap the body again 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.720
 or just take off 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.040
 to clean or something you can do that 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.590
 so an old warning plug connection 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.490
 to solve 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.919
 then to the caravan you are there too 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.530
 first the axis out the original 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.590
 bobbycar axle and then you take two 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.060
 alu your stake on appropriate 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.440
 Length cuts but they need to be longer 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.820
 I'll say something else soon 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.919
 so they have to be so long that they 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.710
 against an eighth monster wheels there 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.850
 It fits into this screw completely 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.000
 1 are common to the eighth with participants in and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.410
 then you do the rods so it will be 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 yes before that stop if that 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.900
 wheels in mind are that the then 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.940
 everything fits in the right way 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.860
 and push the two into each other 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.410
 Do you because if you only the 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.880
 thicker rods then take the forbid 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.800
 just too fast so will the whole 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.610
 more stable so and there is the exact 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.979
 the thickness that should be optimal 18 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.740
 fit in and record 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.580
 spacer makes it easy then 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.050
 take between the wheel and the 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.900
 Caravan again as a piece 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.750
 rubber hose on both sides where then 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 the 18 karat ultimately sits on it and 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.320
 then you can screw in from above 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.090
 make it that thick in the 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.430
 so soft either with the thread 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.199
 anyway he stops or he does it again 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.960
 bit of glue in there or silicone 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.630
 or loctite or isolierband drum or 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.919
 whatever so that's a relative 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.860
 long screw reasonable in the halo 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.389
 I have a flag in it 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.190
 flexible up with a rubber hose 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.020
 made that it does not break and then 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.669
 from both sides with likewise in the piece 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.169
 Rubber hose simply fixed to the 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.360
 roof and if you the caravan 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.570
 then you want to backlight 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.030
 another comeback akkufach 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.400
 easy to install switch and there normal 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.560
 led turn pack then you have the thing 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.169
 also illuminated what I just forgot 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.000
 have the steering wheel that makes it easy 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.539
 from the bottom then with a screw there 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.940
 tuned 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.919
 and if you're all that bit more now 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.690
 Off-road off-road still make 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.780
 then you want these little ones 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.120
 Granules this pad from the caravan 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.340
 also again from Bremen and easily 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.210
 plate down there with one 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.210
 piece 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.210
 sheet 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.310
 3 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.120
 older
