00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.440 
and boys all over the country that
believing<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.430> know<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.700> number<00:03:37.820> one<00:03:38.180> key

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
believing is you know the number one key

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.840 
believing is you know the number one key
and<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:39.140> work<00:03:39.320> hard<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.890> really<00:03:40.489> think<00:03:40.700> that

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
and to work hard so I really think that

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.539 
and to work hard so I really think that
anything<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.930> possible<00:03:41.989> well<00:03:42.980> nasty<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> think

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
anything is possible well nasty I think

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.280 
anything is possible well nasty I think
that's<00:03:43.730> great<00:03:43.940> advice<00:03:44.209> but<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.140> have<00:03:45.260> a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
that's great advice but you have a

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.130 
that's great advice but you have a
unique<00:03:45.650> scenario<00:03:46.130> because<00:03:46.730> your<00:03:47.180> dad<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.540> your

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
unique scenario because your dad is your

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.410 
unique scenario because your dad is your
coach<00:03:48.500> what<00:03:49.220> advice<00:03:49.549> would<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:49.940> give<00:03:50.030> young

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
coach what advice would you give young

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.660

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
and he's been my coach ever I guess for

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.670 
and he's been my coach ever I guess for
the<00:03:55.040> past<00:03:55.250> 10<00:03:55.519> years<00:03:55.549> now<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.440> we<00:03:57.440> have<00:03:57.650> a

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
the past 10 years now so we have a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.830 
the past 10 years now so we have a
really<00:03:57.950> great<00:03:58.160> relationship<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.750> know

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
really great relationship and you know

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.030 
really great relationship and you know
over<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.079> years<00:04:00.110> we've<00:04:00.380> gotten<00:04:00.680> even<00:04:00.739> closer

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
over the years we've gotten even closer

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.180 
over the years we've gotten even closer
being<00:04:01.489> able<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.790> experience<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:02.510> whole

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
being able to experience this whole

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.650 
being able to experience this whole
Olympic<00:04:04.190> success<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.940> things<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.450> come

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
Olympic success and things that come

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.250 
Olympic success and things that come
after<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.140> but<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.269> it's<00:04:08.570> it's<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:09.140> me

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
after it but you know it's it's for me

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.810 
after it but you know it's it's for me
it's<00:04:09.500> easy<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.860> be<00:04:09.980> able<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.280> separate<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
it's easy to be able to separate the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.340 
it's easy to be able to separate the
coach<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.209> dad<00:04:11.390> when<00:04:11.570> we<00:04:11.690> walk<00:04:11.870> into<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.320> gym

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
coach and dad when we walk into the gym

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.800 
coach and dad when we walk into the gym
he<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.920> just<00:04:13.190> my<00:04:13.340> coach<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:13.850> when<00:04:14.269> we<00:04:14.390> walk<00:04:14.600> out

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
he is just my coach and when we walk out

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.690 
he is just my coach and when we walk out
of<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> gym<00:04:15.170> he<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.500> he's<00:04:15.860> my<00:04:16.040> dad<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.519> so<00:04:16.669> I

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
of the gym he is he's my dad and so I

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.810 
of the gym he is he's my dad and so I
think<00:04:16.820> that<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.450> really<00:04:17.930> helps<00:04:18.320> but<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.859> don't

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
think that that really helps but I don't

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.909 
think that that really helps but I don't
know<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.299> something<00:04:20.570> special<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.650> think

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
know it's something special and I think

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.409 
know it's something special and I think
that<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.370> know<00:04:22.490> that's<00:04:22.700> I've<00:04:22.940> always<00:04:23.150> been

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
that you know that's I've always been

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.089 
that you know that's I've always been
very<00:04:23.599> close<00:04:23.840> with<00:04:24.080> both<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.320> my<00:04:24.470> parents<00:04:24.560> but

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
very close with both of my parents but

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.260 
very close with both of my parents but
especially<00:04:25.250> my<00:04:25.640> dad

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
especially my dad

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.390 
especially my dad
so<00:04:26.629> is<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.870> true<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.139> your<00:04:27.349> mom<00:04:27.530> really<00:04:27.949> can't

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
so is it true that your mom really can't

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.730 
so is it true that your mom really can't
watch<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:28.699> compete<00:04:29.330> she<00:04:30.080> gets<00:04:30.289> too<00:04:30.500> nervous

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740
