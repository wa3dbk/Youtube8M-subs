one of them if we did lose maybe it was

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.380

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
gonna be a backward step but picking the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
gonna be a backward step but picking the
points<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:18.750> today<00:00:18.990> massive<00:00:19.650> gaming<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> way

about that Aguero garland the way we
played<00:00:23.550> today<00:00:23.760> okay<00:00:24.300> wasn't<00:00:24.570> amazing<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
played today okay wasn't amazing but the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.960 
played today okay wasn't amazing but the
atmosphere<00:00:25.619> no<00:00:26.070> truffle<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.609> good<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:26.849> I've

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
atmosphere no truffle is as good as I've

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060 
atmosphere no truffle is as good as I've
seen<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.359> very<00:00:27.599> very<00:00:27.750> long<00:00:27.840> time<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.500> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
seen it in a very very long time and I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.259 
seen it in a very very long time and I
think<00:00:29.130> picking<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> three-point<00:00:29.970> shot<00:00:30.150> was

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
think picking the three-point shot was

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.519 
think picking the three-point shot was
more<00:00:30.449> than<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.630> three<00:00:30.810> points<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.199> seals<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
more than a three points it seals the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.530 
more than a three points it seals the
top<00:00:31.769> four<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.059> keeps<00:00:33.270> us<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
top four and it just it keeps us on this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
top four and it just it keeps us on this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I think I think confidence is a big

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
I think I think confidence is a big
thing<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.450> their<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.140> mistakes

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
thing I think with their was mistakes

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
thing I think with their was mistakes
early<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.130> first<00:01:59.369> half<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.850> every

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
early on in that first half but every

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.819 
early on in that first half but every
single<00:02:00.509> man<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.960> pitch<00:02:01.140> today<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
single man on that pitch today at the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
single man on that pitch today at the
right<00:02:02.070> time<00:02:02.340> stepped<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.969> every<00:02:03.329> single<00:02:03.600> one

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
right time stepped up every single one

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.120 
right time stepped up every single one
of<00:02:03.719> them<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.409> move<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.799> gals<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of them and I think move on gals the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.190 
of them and I think move on gals the
same<00:02:05.310> kind<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> man<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.119> okay<00:02:06.570> stumbled

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
same kind of man you know okay stumbled

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.449 
same kind of man you know okay stumbled
early<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.069> game<00:02:08.190> kind<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
early on and I think this game kind of

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.859 
early on and I think this game kind of
represents<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> season<00:02:09.179> stumbled<00:02:09.569> early<00:02:09.750> on

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
represents the season stumbled early on

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.660 
represents the season stumbled early on
but<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> points<00:02:10.860> we've<00:02:11.009> needed<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.459> step

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
but at the points we've needed to step

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.280 
but at the points we've needed to step
up<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.390> points<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.780> we've<00:02:12.900> had<00:02:12.959> chanced

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
up and the points that we've had chanced

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
up and the points that we've had chanced
oppressor

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
oppressor

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.390 
oppressor
but<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> run<00:02:15.159> that<00:02:15.250> we've

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
but on and take on the run that we've

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.920 
but on and take on the run that we've
had<00:02:15.489> like<00:02:16.060> we<00:02:16.209> did<00:02:16.299> when<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.450> started<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.840> game

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
had like we did when we started the game

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.720 
had like we did when we started the game
against<00:02:17.260> Tottenham<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:17.890> he's<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.250> massive

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
against Tottenham I think he's a massive

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.429 
against Tottenham I think he's a massive
boost<00:02:18.909> for<00:02:19.090> everyone<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.599> think<00:02:19.780> style<00:02:20.140> yes

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
boost for everyone and I think style yes

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.020 
boost for everyone and I think style yes
but<00:02:20.739> part<00:02:21.189> that<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.430> down<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.700> confidence

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
but part that is down to confidence

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.300 
but part that is down to confidence
there<00:02:22.299> was<00:02:22.420> back<00:02:22.569> passes<00:02:22.900> today<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:24.129> were

don't<00:02:38.049> I<00:02:38.140> don't<00:02:38.170> mind<00:02:38.530> if<00:02:38.769> that's<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> case

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
don't I don't mind if that's the case

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.589 
don't I don't mind if that's the case
and<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.489> think<00:02:39.519> confidence<00:02:39.879> is<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.480> key

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
and I think confidence is the key

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.380 
and I think confidence is the key
without<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> doubt<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.790> confidence

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
without a doubt can that confidence

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
without a doubt can that confidence
bring<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.079> title<00:02:44.409> challenge<00:02:44.560> make<00:02:44.920> sure

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
bring a title challenge make sure

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.330 
bring a title challenge make sure
definitely<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.629> mean<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.049> think<00:02:47.590> we're<00:02:48.159> maybe

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
definitely I mean I think we're maybe

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.500 
definitely I mean I think we're maybe
just<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.730> couple<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:49.090> games<00:02:49.120> behind

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
just a couple of games behind

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.000 
just a couple of games behind
challenging<00:02:50.139> this<00:02:50.230> year<00:02:50.440> now<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.739> think<00:02:50.920> if

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
challenging this year now I think if

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.410 
challenging this year now I think if
there<00:02:51.040> was<00:02:51.220> another<00:02:51.400> 23<00:02:51.819> games<00:02:52.030> at<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.299> end<00:02:52.389> of

there was another 23 games at the end of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.089 
there was another 23 games at the end of
the<00:02:52.510> season<00:02:52.659> then<00:02:53.379> we<00:02:53.530> could<00:02:53.680> challenge<00:02:53.889> with

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
the season then we could challenge with

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.129 
the season then we could challenge with
the<00:02:54.159> title<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:54.489> year<00:02:54.549> but<00:02:55.269> playing<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.019> way

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139
