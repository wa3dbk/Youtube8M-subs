00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.910
 young communard 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.789
 earlier game 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.890
 and today it is considered that the real 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.860
 according to the draft 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.750
 with Anton yes of course this is a commodity 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.500
 guess what it is 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 so, but I think it's just some kind of firm. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 cities 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.780
 that's wrong 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.620
 5 channel 9 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 let's go 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.730
 st plan 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.540
 I was warm Kornyakova 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.550
 and the court goes down 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.550
 Vova this Gazprom opened as state 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.649
 and if such goals as the mechanism works 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.590
 let's go show 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.330
 Anton Booth are indicative she 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.350
 of course 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 how so here to 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
 close a year ago we ask to save sports 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.150
 him that she was not remarkable 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 put the court 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.480
 and here and so the mechanism works and 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 ships 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 so here but not all at home you were 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.800
 who and whom 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.070
 and not yet 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.170
 so how bad is a block 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 us 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.250
 even if the switchings here and 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.999
 below 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.849
 they say you will lower another song I am a patriot 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:47.640
 under the contract 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.020
 within this will not happen 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.170
 yes so often 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.160
 bad 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.230
 Here I worked on it to work 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.500
 and here I am 12 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830
 to be noticed by a monopolist flood 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.790
 tandem 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.530
 so much time 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.080
 data on such 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.939
 it is very small 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.720
 I think he thought subscribe to the channel 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.919
 put likes 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.409
 and even without comment 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.729
 what do you want it too 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.669
 comparing these 25 years 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.369
