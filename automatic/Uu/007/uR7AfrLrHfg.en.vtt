00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:24.259
 welcome to paris follow me i 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.009
 started the blog a year ago and taste 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:33.290
 because I had organized Christmas for 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.970

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.199

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.610

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.820
 I am well aware that thanks to 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.550
 blog I finally could I have a lot of 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.610
 luck I could do things 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.830
 incredible like writing a book then 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.300
 especially I could start my freelance 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.500
 thanks to the blog all the opportunities 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.500
 that will bring 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.030
 I would say that at the beginning you have to be 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.300
 regular and regular but not in the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.070
 meaning we do not put shitty stuff 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.229
 are rare true contents and it is necessary 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.330
 to force a little bit even 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.680
 not sure where to really care 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 flame as in a relationship at the beginning 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.470
 we try to surprise ourselves 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.539
 they are all sitting in silence 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.160
 this must surprise his readers 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.070
 Then I would say that you have to have a 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.530
 true editorial line always have 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.600
 an ethic and keep in mind that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.160
 do it for yourself and we do not do a blog 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.080
 to become rich or have gifts 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.950
 to the poor I want to do that for them 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.800
 want to share to find a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.830
 topic 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 and find the way we want 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.160
 to treat it and not to be another 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 fashion blog with ten town halls photos from 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.750
 something that will not tell you 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.290

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.900
 finally why make money money and well 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.880
 there is an American saying that says when 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.330
 life you give lemons making of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.330

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.440
 so I do a little bit but the anthem is 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.980
 in the sense that when life gives it 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.250
