00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.709
 we have 85 20 which has a problem 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.709
 on the keyboard 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 m 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 what are these 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.110
 these clues without content between them 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.280
 the one in the center are these 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 parties accordingly when added 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.640
 and it's the main line automatically 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.320
 this year 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.740
 the others that continue to continue 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 and what we are going to do 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.310
 in this case since you have a line 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.310
 complete wide 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.710
 let's go sons 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.710
 to proceed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.180
 when lifting the shield 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.040
 and the controller we want there 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.020
 fraser and fit that makes this 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.600
 line 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.850
 the second 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.490
 is the one that controls 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.810
 these keys are concerned Sana'a 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.380
 damaged from where we live here 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.659
 they have to have continuity 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.850
 having no continuity means that 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.240
 the line is not coming here and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.610
 let's make a bridge from the center here 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.970
 but here we see this complete scheme of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.880
 all the keyboard of the blackberry 8520 and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.580
 we can see how each color indicates 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.939
 of each key its internal part and its 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.220
 external part where it makes contact with 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.619
 the numbering that each 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.489
 controller we can know what is 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.370
 exactly they handle that that continuity 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.069
 then we see that in our case he speaks 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.239
 of continuity 1 which says that 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.569
 although the keys and klm of the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.510
 iese pk then those are the ones 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.950
 we have to review the first 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.680
 what we have to do when we get there 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.049
 an 85 entity because of key problems is 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.750
 that we are going to test every continuity of 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.180
 each key we know that each key is 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.730
 links to another one that is a line 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.890
 complete is a series of several keys 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.799
 those that are damaged everything we have to 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.380
 try is first that there is continuous 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.150
 the keys to the controller if there are with 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.430
 continuity of the keys of the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.230
 controller let's just be a 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.019
 jumper 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.420
 in case there is no continuity 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.909
 of the keys the controller would have 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.120
 to do the next good step to 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.250
 clarify what week gets in google 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.920
 looking for 85 20 paypal and we see that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.530
 our solution was to prove 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.019
 continuity to those keys that we see there 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.540
 in purple that we see with the lines and 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.340
 looking from there to there 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.650
 controller where it says one had to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.959
 have continuity and had no continuity 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.519
 because it was the problem that the track is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.519
 broken we made the continuity 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.430
 now we carry soldiers and the line 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.980
 to the controller and right now we're going to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.330
 release it to the back where the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.330
 sensors of the keys 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.380
 so we're going to do the following 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.810
 let's apply plus 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.310
 to that part that we are going to give to 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.230
 miss 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.540
 we are not going to apply this year directly 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.560
 on the key so that we do not go to 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.980
 be that a turn of welding but 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.080
 that we are going to move gently the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.510
 tin that is on the tip of the captive 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.600
 with this we are going to get a very 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.460
 fine tin that will not disturb us 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.460
 for nothing on the keyboard after 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.560
 we pick up stranger at the tip of the 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.460
 soldering iron we apply the soldering iron that takes us 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.960
 a little tin and we come back and what 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.599
 we pass gently remember that 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.430
 we have to make a thin layer and not 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:01.580
 we can not stay too high or 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.330
 brun or tin in that part then 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.040
 we see how it was happening there and what 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.140
 what we are going to do is sweep this 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.700
 special tool to be able to sweep 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.980
 the tin with this tool also 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.690
 we can clean the soldering iron 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.900
 We sell this tool in our 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.900
 page 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.030
 i 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.489
 of welding this thread there to the part 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:59.849
 internal of this track we see how there is a 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:02.610
 light layer of tape below there where 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.459
 I'm going to put the cable under it 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.379
 large selvedge from outside there is tape that 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.919
 vice that the cable does not make me 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.919
 short there 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.600
 to have a good weld a good 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.140
 heritage 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.810
 from cable to miss it there we have to 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.330
 that apply good flush good flush for 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.370
 be able to have a clean weld and 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.320
 accurate 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.689
 from fluxÃ¡ I sell it in our 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.899
 page stuck to the other end of the cable 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:35.689
 to the audience within the track that are 

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:37.339
 those that control the keys as they have 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.899
 continue three is already making them 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.719
 account only one they would have to 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:44.149
 repair in others I'm 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:47.720
 we see as of posts without late mayor 

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:50.240
 new so that it cuts on the other 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.550
 from outside when we count the lentil 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.820
 because sometimes you canoe them from the short 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.820
 in 3 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.360
 the target
