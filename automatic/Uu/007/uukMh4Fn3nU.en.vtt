hoop in my tragus piercing what I found

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.110 
hoop in my tragus piercing what I found
helpful<00:03:32.960> when<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.440> do<00:03:33.560> get<00:03:33.830> keloids<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.970> will

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
helpful when I do get keloids is I will

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.570 
helpful when I do get keloids is I will
take<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.660> I<00:03:35.720> will<00:03:35.780> push<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.440> ball<00:03:36.590> up

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
take it and I will push the ball up

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.730 
take it and I will push the ball up
against<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.180> keloid<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.110> what<00:03:39.710> that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
against the keloid like that what that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.680 
against the keloid like that what that
does<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.370> helps<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.760> ring<00:03:41.030> from<00:03:41.450> moving

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
does is it helps the ring from moving

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.590 
does is it helps the ring from moving
too<00:03:41.990> much<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.920> just<00:03:43.160> keeps<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.760> keloid

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
too much and it just keeps the keloid

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.360 
too much and it just keeps the keloid
pressed<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.680> there's<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.920> lot<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.160> pressure

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
pressed on so there's a lot of pressure

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.400 
pressed on so there's a lot of pressure
on<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.790> which<00:03:46.940> helps<00:03:47.240> it<00:03:47.360> go<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.600> faster<00:03:48.200> I

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
on it which helps it go down faster I

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.810 
on it which helps it go down faster I
don't<00:03:48.860> know<00:03:48.920> if<00:03:49.040> that's<00:03:49.220> worked<00:03:49.430> for<00:03:49.610> anyone

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
don't know if that's worked for anyone

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.520 
don't know if that's worked for anyone
else<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:50.210> I<00:03:50.390> noticed<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.960> has<00:03:51.140> worked<00:03:51.380> for

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
else but I noticed that has worked for

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.770 
else but I noticed that has worked for
me<00:03:51.740> and<00:03:51.920> it's<00:03:52.070> worked<00:03:52.340> beautifully<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.660> that

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
me and it's worked beautifully so that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.300 
me and it's worked beautifully so that
is<00:03:53.900> what<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.110> do<00:03:54.170> when<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.530> have<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.710> keloid<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
is what I do when I have a keloid and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.740 
is what I do when I have a keloid and
then<00:03:55.490> when<00:03:55.610> it's<00:03:55.760> gone<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:55.940> just<00:03:56.090> kind<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.540> move

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
then when it's gone I just kind of move

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.690 
then when it's gone I just kind of move
it<00:03:56.900> back<00:03:57.110> down<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.470> where<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:57.860> want<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.310> but
