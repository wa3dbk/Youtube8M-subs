00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello friends welcome to rock and play 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:07.560
 We are doing a series of videos in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.630
 around the barbs by looking at what type of barb 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 and how do you take it now let's see 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.240
 how they sound to see how they sound we are going to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.280
 see different types of thicknesses and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.710
 different types of materials we're going 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.050
 to see here is already explained in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 the video if you do not listen is looking at 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.420
 interesting we have said that the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.090
 Nylon point that the plastic spikes 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 toughest plastic game for thumb this 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.340
 you see little because it's transparent from 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 metal metacrilate then I'll go 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.559
 to make a series of wheels first I'm going 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.559
 to touch by hand 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.930
 with the hand with the plectrum softer than me 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.930
 I know that I have here the 038 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.500
 It is a highly recommended cure for 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.449
 people who are starting to play with 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.000
 chicken that is starting to touch things 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.080
 rhythmic because it's so soft so soft 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.119
 you do not notice you do not feel force with the pick 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.370
 your fingers do not give us vibrate people do not know 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.590
 it escapes you if it's true 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.480
 click click click of the barb it shows 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.170
 a lot that you hear a lot because I can catch 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.170
 a little more 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.159
 as I go up thick it goes up 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.159
 the volume too 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.740
 Now you hear more and not hear both 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 click click of the voice 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 How is it going 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.520
 the water plastic sounds a lot but 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.740
 on the contrary you have the comfort of not 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.280
 you vibrate at hand and you will not escape so 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.939
 would sound the sand and which to choose 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.179
 obviously with the most comfortable 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.490
 we are for that we have suffered a video 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.190
 the different thicknesses since the one of 0 60 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.379
 070 for rhythmic t is pretty good is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.330
 quite acceptable if we were to do 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.610
 I like touches that are harder 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.959
 that are more or less than 1 for example the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.959
 sound difference between nylon 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.819
 and what is plastic 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 and hey much sharper you hear a lot more 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.180
 crystalline with this type of material that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.360
 with nylon the nylon is made on 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.090
 everything for nylon strings 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.269
 spanish guitar strings because 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.180
 because it is let's say the same material and 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.459
 hits more the sound apart from nylon is 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.049
 much more sensitive to cuts with the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.390
 steel ropes by the force of metal 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.910
 and we can be hooked with the passage of 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 time we are hooked this guy 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.329
 of quad the only thing it does is wear 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.709
 a little bit but it never goes away 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.900
 to bite that is what happens with those of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.450
 nylon 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.450
 harder plastic gives you more volume 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.530
 and there we would enter the perception of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.530
 when I like the gallon more 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.120
 crystalline although maybe with the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.100
 mobile you do not notice the difference we go in 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.100
 A metal can give you much more 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.290
 yes yes 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.670
 with metal gives a more crystalline sound 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.760
 with more acute with more brightness much more 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.170
 nice but by against damaging the strings 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.500
 you have to get a little balance already 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.000
 depends on how you like it 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.000
 the methacrylate had not tested it 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.979
 and always taking the same thing so that 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.979
 we can appreciate 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.660
 Y 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.970
 sounding different and then he's on the run 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.970
 of thumb we are 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.630
 I was about to use more packages 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.170
 but touch colors 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.170
 i 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.440
 different well this is the kind of 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.990
 forest that there is more or less and what kind of 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.570
 sound give mainly nylon 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.419
 String of nylon cords 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.699
 Spanish guitar type and all the rest 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.259
 for acoustic guitar or guitar 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.750
 electric if we are going to do rhythm then 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.479
 a soft flexible plectrum and if we go to 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.139
 put a harder pick so that it is us 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.139
 more selective 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.970
 so that we can have more control over 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.770
 on the plectrum the string and the sound that 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.910
 we want to do, this has been everything 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.910
 I hope it was from adidas
