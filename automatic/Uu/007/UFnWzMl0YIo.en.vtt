00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
I've got one of these 3G 4G sprint

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.320 
I've got one of these 3G 4G sprint
mobile<00:00:13.230> hotspot<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.219> generally<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.150> works

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
mobile hotspot and generally it works

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.740

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
Wireless dual band cell booster so I'm

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
Wireless dual band cell booster so I'm
gonna<00:00:37.770> set<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
gonna set it up and we'll see how it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.880 
gonna set it up and we'll see how it
works

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890

what the guy called it this is the
antenna<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.710> goes<00:00:49.860> inside<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> would

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
antenna that goes inside and you would

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.840 
antenna that goes inside and you would
you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.300> put<00:00:51.510> your<00:00:51.629> cell<00:00:51.840> phone<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.379> your

you know put your cell phone or your

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.560 
you know put your cell phone or your
Wi-Fi<00:00:53.930> near<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:56.610> boost<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> goes<00:00:57.420> on

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Wi-Fi near that to boost it that goes on

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.880 
Wi-Fi near that to boost it that goes on
the<00:00:57.690> inside<00:00:58.250> see<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.399> got<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.500> cigarette

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the inside see it's got the cigarette

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
the inside see it's got the cigarette
lighter<00:01:01.920> plug<00:01:03.409> going<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.559> DC<00:01:05.270> but<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> also<00:01:06.570> got

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
lighter plug going on DC but I also got

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.100 
lighter plug going on DC but I also got
the<00:01:07.189> AC<00:01:08.189> adapter<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.659> guess<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the AC adapter and this is I guess this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
the AC adapter and this is I guess this
is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> actual<00:01:16.220> antenna<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> made

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is the actual antenna now this is made

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
is the actual antenna now this is made
for<00:01:18.540> car<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.860> put<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.100> on

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
for car so you know you can put this on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
for car so you know you can put this on
the<00:01:20.400> truck<00:01:20.700> -<00:01:22.640> what<00:01:23.640> else<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the truck - what else we got here the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.399 
the truck - what else we got here the
antenna<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> antennas<00:01:27.210> got<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.750> magnet<00:01:28.290> on

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
antenna now the antennas got a magnet on

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.100 
antenna now the antennas got a magnet on
it<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> work<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it which is not going to work for this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
it which is not going to work for this
trailer<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> trailer<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.670> mostly

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
trailer because the trailer is mostly

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.710 
trailer because the trailer is mostly
fiberglass<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> guy<00:01:34.170> gave<00:01:34.530> me<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.720> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
fiberglass so the guy gave me this it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
fiberglass so the guy gave me this it's
a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.049> piece<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.530> metal<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.189> some<00:01:38.220> velcro

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
a little piece of metal with some velcro

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.249 
a little piece of metal with some velcro
on<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:41.000> I'm<00:01:42.000> gonna<00:01:42.180> stick<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.960> top<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
on it and I'm gonna stick that on top of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.130 
on it and I'm gonna stick that on top of
the<00:01:43.470> slide<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.600> could<00:01:45.750> stick<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the slide and then we could stick the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.800 
the slide and then we could stick the
antenna<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.270> should<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
antenna on there and this should do it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
antenna on there and this should do it
hopefully<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> we'll<00:01:51.180> see

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hopefully this will do it and we'll see

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.730 
hopefully this will do it and we'll see
how<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> goes

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.660 

okay<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.490> top<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.850> my<00:01:55.940> dirty<00:01:56.210> slide<00:01:56.630> I'll

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
okay the top of my dirty slide I'll

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.800 
okay the top of my dirty slide I'll
clean<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.700> up<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.270> stick<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:01.600> antenna<00:02:02.600> up

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
clean it up and stick the antenna up

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.040 
clean it up and stick the antenna up
here<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.260> like<00:02:03.440> rubber<00:02:04.750> made<00:02:05.750> out<00:02:05.900> of

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
here this is like rubber made out of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.630 
here this is like rubber made out of
rubber<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:09.080> then<00:02:09.380> antenna<00:02:09.860> needs<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.340> stick

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
rubber and then antenna needs to stick

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.170 
rubber and then antenna needs to stick
on<00:02:10.850> metal<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.750> there<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.459> Mayo<00:02:13.670> this

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
on metal and there it is the Mayo this

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.000 
on metal and there it is the Mayo this
is<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.360> strong<00:02:14.750> magnet<00:02:15.290> strong<00:02:15.770> magnet<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.430> this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
is a strong magnet strong magnet on this

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.530 
is a strong magnet strong magnet on this
okay<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> then<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:24.280> got<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.459> wire<00:02:25.700> coming<00:02:26.180> down

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
okay so then I got the wire coming down

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.110 
okay so then I got the wire coming down
and<00:02:28.989> I'm<00:02:29.989> gonna<00:02:30.230> forget<00:02:30.380> this<00:02:30.590> wire<00:02:31.120> through

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and I'm gonna forget this wire through

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.850 
and I'm gonna forget this wire through
the<00:02:32.690> screen<00:02:34.360> okay<00:02:35.360> there<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.560> figure<00:02:36.800> if

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the screen okay there it is I figure if

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.259 
the screen okay there it is I figure if
I<00:02:37.040> kind<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.940> leave<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.450> like<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.260> that'll
