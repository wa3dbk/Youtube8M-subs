00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
simplest ones though I mean to have to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.750 
simplest ones though I mean to have to
fight<00:00:59.910> people<00:01:00.350> but<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.710> Riddler<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.550> need

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
him for a lot of the red bricks that box

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
him for a lot of the red bricks that box
back<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.720> only<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> with

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
back there it's you can only use it with

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.210 
back there it's you can only use it with
the<00:01:14.640> Riddler<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.740> there's<00:01:16.740> red<00:01:16.979> bricks

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the Riddler and there's red bricks

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
the Riddler and there's red bricks
inside<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:19.759> that's<00:01:20.810> really<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.110> only

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
inside of it so that's really the only

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.310 
inside of it so that's really the only
reason<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> Riddler<00:01:23.509> actually<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.770 

this<00:01:28.460> Riddler<00:01:29.460> crate<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> red<00:01:30.780> brick<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
this Riddler crate with the red brick is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.890 
this Riddler crate with the red brick is
invincibility<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> Riddler<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.900> 125

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
invincibility and the Riddler is 125

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.760 
invincibility and the Riddler is 125
thousand<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.229> come<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
thousand so if you come up here you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.020 
thousand so if you come up here you
might<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.939> think<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
might want to have I think the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.929 
might want to have I think the
invincibility<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.860> five<00:01:47.610> hundred

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
invincibility is like five hundred

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.870 
invincibility is like five hundred
thousand<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> might<00:01:50.700> want<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.060> about

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
thousand so you might want to have about

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.249 
thousand so you might want to have about
seven<00:01:53.880> hundred<00:01:54.180> thousand<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.079> here

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
seven hundred thousand if you go up here

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.719 
seven hundred thousand if you go up here
