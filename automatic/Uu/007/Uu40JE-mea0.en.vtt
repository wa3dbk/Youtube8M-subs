00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello very good to all kids today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.580
 start and once again if I canary 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.470
 I bring a new ballast on portal 2 in 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.170
 this time we are in chapter 8 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.500
 camera 15 is worth and in this axis in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 issues is a little simpler than the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.460
 previous but good is the same 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.859
 Magnitudes is a disaster that was already 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.260
 date I did not know is pretty fat come on 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.539
 to meet day to hit character 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 cooperative or multiplayer like 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.439
 you want to call it ap body the robot this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.760
 elongated orange I will leave a photo here 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 in one of the corners so you can see 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
 who are we going to see it in the mode a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 player ok are going to be only about 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.219
 seconds but there's going to be in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 so we just have to get out of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.809
 the test as you see I said that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 is the camera 15 ok and we have to look 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.390
 this side of here is worth this then 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.210
 begin wall will begin to fall 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.489
 and we will see the friend of body vale tarda 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.469
 it takes a little while first we have to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.870
 wait for the street TV to stop 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.640
 talk and then that's when you go see 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.350
 you see there is already the friend peabody 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.400
 that is left scared and goes away 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.990
 running super, it's worth now 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.760
 ok is part of the text but now 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.570
 I'm going to show you something a little fatter 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.240
 I'll teach you how to get where 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.950
 We are able to see you more closely 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.080
 so I'm going to make a cut and come back 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.520
 to start the same mission but in this 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.409
 case let's try to reach him 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.479
 it's worth as I just said in this 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.119
 chance we will get to where it is 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.369
 but say ok let's get to the side 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.100
 of the is taking advantage of a small owl or a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.530
 small mistake if I would call it that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.580
 I would not call it otherwise because 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.649
 After all, what we do is 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.990
 traverse a wall with a portal worth 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.960
 but we have to do it very fast 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.060
 because the map starts moving with a 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.950
 countdown since we left and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.420
 everything is programmed through 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 seconds then we have to do it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.710
 just at the right time it's worth so 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.730
 we just have to run away to come to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.800
 this corner here 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.620
 and launch the portal there there was there 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.100
 you have seen him do the other here and 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.260
 we can come running 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.610
 ok then we jump here and here is 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.600
 the door where we have seen before ap 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.560
 body and magic here is p body we can 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.350
 see him a player mode there are no modes no 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.750
 there are no hedges do not use yet nothing weird 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.820
 ok is the original mode of such and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.460
 comes standard you can do it 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.620
 same as I say chapter 8 camera 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.990
 15 ok it 's a little bug in which 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.310
 we can go through these panels here 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.800
 that break 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.600
 and just meet the friend body vale 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 as you have seen before yes yes now 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.580
 I go back there I think you could 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.100
 back throwing us around 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.220
 if I shot here 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.050
 and I come back 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.960
 and we come back here now you are going to see 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.370
 like the body the robot makes its animation 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.190
 relevant 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.830
 there you see that he makes the turn there 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.050
 it's running, it's worth, and I do not expect anything 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.200
 have liked this this little premiere 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.730
 so interesting not so extravagant as 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.310
 the previous one that we saw but just as 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.110
 really curious that the guys from 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.390
 valve they work a lot dirty 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.470
 this axis and nothing to say to you I hope that 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.700
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.700
 next chapter a greeting
