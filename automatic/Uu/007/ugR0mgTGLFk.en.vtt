00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.040 
think of Sun Drop and it has that kick
to<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.429> like<00:01:59.429> a<00:01:59.460> lemon<00:01:59.880> lime<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.750> it's

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
to it so it's like a lemon lime but it's

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.630 
to it so it's like a lemon lime but it's
a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:01.619> cut<00:02:01.800> back<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.250> lemon<00:02:02.580> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a little bit cut back on the lemon and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.570 
a little bit cut back on the lemon and
lime<00:02:02.910> but<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.420> has<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.869> bit<00:02:04.050> more<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
lime but it has a little bit more of the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.029 
lime but it has a little bit more of the
orange<00:02:05.580> fruits<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.410> use<00:02:07.530> origin

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
orange fruits because or they use origin

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.110 
orange fruits because or they use origin
stuff<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.940> good

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
stuff in now and do and it's pretty good

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.630 
stuff in now and do and it's pretty good
it's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> say<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.769> amazing<00:02:14.370> but

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640

okay cool so it's got that going for it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.410 
okay cool so it's got that going for it
I<00:02:23.160> would<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.550> agree<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:23.970> pretty<00:02:24.300> much

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
I would have to agree with pretty much

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.220 
I would have to agree with pretty much
all<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:25.170> what<00:02:25.350> Tyler<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.920> said<00:02:26.130> um<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.780> feels

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
all of what Tyler just said um it feels

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.380 
all of what Tyler just said um it feels
kind<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.709> mountain<00:02:29.340> dew<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.910> Mountain

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
kind of like mountain dew if Mountain

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.680 
kind of like mountain dew if Mountain
Dew<00:02:30.769> pull<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.950> intensity<00:02:32.459> back<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.180> added<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
Dew pull the intensity back and added a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390 
Dew pull the intensity back and added a
little<00:02:33.900> bit<00:02:34.140> more<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> lemon<00:02:34.769> lime<00:02:35.130> ish

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
little bit more of the lemon lime ish

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.830 
little bit more of the lemon lime ish
flavor<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.239> think<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.630> pretty<00:02:37.470> good<00:02:37.590> it's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
flavor and I think it's pretty good it's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.330 
flavor and I think it's pretty good it's
it<00:02:39.840> doesn't<00:02:40.230> feel<00:02:40.380> quite<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> sprite

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it doesn't feel quite like a sprite

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.449 
it doesn't feel quite like a sprite
ripoff<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.090> still<00:02:42.480> feels<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.049> has<00:02:43.200> some

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
ripoff it still feels like it has some

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.590 
ripoff it still feels like it has some
elements<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.549> Mountain<00:02:44.880> Dew<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.239> there<00:02:45.420> which

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
elements of Mountain Dew in there which

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.090 
elements of Mountain Dew in there which
i<00:02:45.720> think<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:46.049> good<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.560> pulling<00:02:46.920> back<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
i think is good but pulling back the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.640 
i think is good but pulling back the
intensity<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:48.690> i<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.170> intensity

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
intensity because i think the intensity

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.650 
intensity because i think the intensity
of<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.160> what<00:02:50.370> turns<00:02:50.610> off<00:02:50.910> most<00:02:51.209> people<00:02:51.570> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
of it is what turns off most people to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.569 
of it is what turns off most people to
Mountain<00:02:51.989> Dew<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.799> first<00:02:53.010> place<00:02:53.160> am<00:02:53.459> i

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
Mountain Dew in the first place am i

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.539 
Mountain Dew in the first place am i
right<00:02:53.989> definitely<00:02:54.989> okay<00:02:55.410> well<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:56.100> thought<00:02:56.400> was

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
right definitely okay well I thought was

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.960 
right definitely okay well I thought was
pretty<00:02:56.670> good<00:02:57.620> they<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:58.890> summed<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.430> it

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
pretty good they really summed it up it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.699 
pretty good they really summed it up it
was<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:00.180> overall<00:03:00.840> pretty<00:03:01.049> good<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.320> definitely

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
was all overall pretty good I definitely

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.170

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
liked that and it didn't taste super

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.420 
liked that and it didn't taste super
sugary<00:03:13.049> like<00:03:13.350> mountain<00:03:13.799> dew<00:03:13.829> you<00:03:14.010> chose<00:03:14.280> which

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
sugary like mountain dew you chose which

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.520 
sugary like mountain dew you chose which
was<00:03:14.549> always<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> huge<00:03:15.150> turnoff<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.570> me<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.500> I

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
was always a huge turnoff for me so I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.590 
was always a huge turnoff for me so I
would<00:03:16.769> definitely<00:03:17.180> definitely<00:03:18.180> read<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
would definitely definitely read it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.410 
would definitely definitely read it
higher<00:03:18.780> than<00:03:18.810> any<00:03:19.109> other<00:03:19.350> Mountain<00:03:19.590> Dew<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:21.000> I

no<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.830> don't<00:03:50.160> think<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:50.550> supposed<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> have

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.150 
no I don't think it's supposed to have
much<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.450> do<00:03:51.570> with<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.810> flavor<00:03:52.050> yeah<00:03:52.470> i<00:03:52.740> was

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
much to do with the flavor yeah i was

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.620 
much to do with the flavor yeah i was
told<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.460> moonshine<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.060> made<00:03:54.270> incorrectly

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
told that moonshine if made incorrectly

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.290 
told that moonshine if made incorrectly
to<00:03:54.960> be<00:03:55.050> quite<00:03:55.230> poisonous<00:03:55.440> yes<00:03:55.950> I'm<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:57.240> sure

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
to be quite poisonous yes I'm not sure

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.780 
to be quite poisonous yes I'm not sure
that's<00:03:57.780> because<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.350> alcoholic<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.130> think<00:03:59.430> it

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that's because it's alcoholic I think it

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.640 
that's because it's alcoholic I think it
would<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.210> do<00:04:00.570> with<00:04:00.720> alcohol<00:04:01.140> poisoning
