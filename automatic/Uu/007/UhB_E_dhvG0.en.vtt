now in the blue at around fifty percent
at<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> other<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.700> manual

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
at the other thing there's manual

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.920 
at the other thing there's manual
dimmers<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.140> their<00:01:17.100> box<00:01:17.700> down<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
dimmers on their box down here you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
dimmers on their box down here you can
see<00:01:19.110> those<00:01:19.290> dimmer<00:01:19.619> switches<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:22.400> in<00:01:23.400> my

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
see those dimmer switches so in my

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.840 
see those dimmer switches so in my
opinion<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.090> tank<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.600> has<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> rather<00:01:25.860> actinic

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
opinion the tank so has a rather actinic

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
opinion the tank so has a rather actinic
or<00:01:27.600> blue<00:01:28.170> look<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:30.020> even<00:01:31.020> though<00:01:31.140> i'm

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
or blue look to it even though i'm

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
or blue look to it even though i'm
running<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> blues<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.220> fifty<00:01:32.520> percent<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
running the blues at fifty percent the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.200 
running the blues at fifty percent the
white<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> hundred<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> i<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:35.310> try<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> do

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
white at a hundred so i would try to do

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.850 
white at a hundred so i would try to do
it<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.450> again<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.020> would<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.409> do

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it all over again I would probably do

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.020 
it all over again I would probably do
one<00:01:38.759> white<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.680> 5050<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.610> blue

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.639 

because<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> wish<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.750> tank<00:01:46.020> we're<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
because I wish the tank we're just a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.420 
because I wish the tank we're just a
little<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.189> brighter<00:01:48.000> more<00:01:48.810> white<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.250> I'm

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
little bit brighter more white and I'm

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700 
little bit brighter more white and I'm
just<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.820> wasting<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.229> fifty

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
just kind of wasting you know fifty

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
just kind of wasting you know fifty
percent<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.159> power<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.119> blues<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:54.869> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
percent of power on the blues because I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.270 
percent of power on the blues because I
don't<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.290> them<00:01:55.380> turned<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> way

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
don't have them turned up all the way

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.819 
don't have them turned up all the way
and<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:57.540> don't<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.590> more

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and I don't really want it much more

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.450 
and I don't really want it much more
actinic<00:01:59.369> than<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> already<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> camera

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
actinic than it is already the camera

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.170 
actinic than it is already the camera
