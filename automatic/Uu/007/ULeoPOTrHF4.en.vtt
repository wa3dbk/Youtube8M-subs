00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello my name is Andrei and today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.270
 I want to tell how we periodically 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.550
 we harvest a very large volume here 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 such wooden wedges from which, like 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.170
 why look further but first everything 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.230
 just looking for dry 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 not much needed board format is allowed 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.080
 50 on the table for 150 to 200 and we put them in 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.080
 our case for segments of 7 centimeters 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.950
 then each of the segments is already starting 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.739
 cut under the workpiece blank it so 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.840
 that piece which then when sawing 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.110
 the diagonal will give us two wedges and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 50 boards it turns out pretty 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 big impressive here for us not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 always comfortable and take the board sometimes and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.670
 thinner 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.170
 further interesting we need ours 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.320
 blanks to dissolve at an angle and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.720
 get two wedges at once from one to 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.160
 do it quickly neatly and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.910
 effectively we will have to apply 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.910
 special mandrel 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.630
 all our harvested wedges 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 have an angle of 15 degrees whether 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.650
 wide and narrow high wedge long 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.380
 short 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.540
 when used in sharing 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.150
 we always get a flat platform between 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.119
 top and bottom it is necessary for work 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.670
 and now the last question remains why 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.190
 Us so many wedges by the way the main 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.229
 the work of these wedges is carried out in 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.960
 installation of lighthouses under the fill 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 cement-sand screed wide lines 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.900
 dude on the installation of wooden floors 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.850
 often use them when installing windows 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.850
 door slopes in principle on any kind 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.250
 assembly will not find their place store them 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.800
 in a dry warehouse we take as needed 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.950
 we loaded ourselves a bucket before work 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:46.190
 and here you go a little video from my 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 canal usually cement-sand mortar 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.239
 when after we freeze the lighthouses 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.100
 before pouring cement-sand 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.100
 the solution we of course clinic which 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.430
 maybe we take out the wedges in general 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.830
 not material is a tool and with a vengeance 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.190
 will pay back the time spent on it 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.010
 making so use guys 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.049
 good luck to everyone who watches me thanks who 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.049
 watched to the end to the soon
