00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
on the shaver it's four blades but it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.030 
on the shaver it's four blades but it's
four<00:00:33.540> blades<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:35.030> its<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.480> nice<00:00:37.040> change

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
four blades of its really nice change

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.959 
four blades of its really nice change
really<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:39.079> all<00:00:40.100> Chaffetz<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.370> very

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
really well of all Chaffetz are very

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.680 
really well of all Chaffetz are very
very<00:00:42.239> expensive<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
very expensive so I not just by these I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.350 
very expensive so I not just by these I
also<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.809> Venus<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.460> with<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.940> they

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
also use a Venus but with this all they

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.560 
also use a Venus but with this all they
 really<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:52.730> no<00:00:53.730> cuts<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.210> anything<00:00:54.539> or

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
 really good no cuts or anything or

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.279 
 really good no cuts or anything or
any<00:00:54.960> problems<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.899> guess<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.469> just

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
any problems I guess it's really just

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
any problems I guess it's really just
you<00:01:01.289> buy<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> trimmer<00:01:02.309> i<00:01:02.460> guess

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you buy it for the trimmer i guess

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
you buy it for the trimmer i guess
because<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.329> shaver<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.350> decent<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
because the shaver it's decent it's a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.899 
because the shaver it's decent it's a
good<00:01:05.729> shaver<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.500> i<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.340> my

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
good shaver but you know i just by my

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.570 
good shaver but you know i just by my
venus<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.439> work<00:01:10.830> better<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.369> me<00:01:11.460> i'll

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
venus they just work better for me i'll

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
venus they just work better for me i'll
just<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.150> better<00:01:12.299> i<00:01:12.420> guess<00:01:12.720> because

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
just like them better i guess because

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.280 
just like them better i guess because
this<00:01:13.530> seems<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.040> bulky<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.670> home<00:01:15.290> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this seems a little bulky to home to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.380 
this seems a little bulky to home to
shave<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:18.689> has<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.009> like

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
shave like it has like this is like

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.230 
shave like it has like this is like
rubbery<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.200> grip<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
rubbery so you can grip it but it just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.149 
rubbery so you can grip it but it just
doesn't<00:01:24.630> seem<00:01:25.020> practical<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.799> other<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
doesn't seem practical the other one is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
doesn't seem practical the other one is
smaller<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.390> hurry<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.780> shave<00:01:28.650> your

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
smaller so you can hurry up shave your

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370 
smaller so you can hurry up shave your
underarms<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.579> whatever<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.720> trimmer<00:01:31.079> I
