00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.930
 Cutting knife plotter installation 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.880
 valid for models b 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.880
 cs cr and cd 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.910
 here we have two essential elements in 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.700
 a plotter cut the knife and the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.619
 knife holder the fourth knife has 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.360
 two parts that separate by turning the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.210
 one plastic and one metallic 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.370
 and the knife in order that we have 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.370
 the 45 degree angle knives 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.210
 this is perfect and accurate for many 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 materials composed of tungsten 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.860
 reinforced for longer duration 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.700
 we open the knife holder rotator 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.500
 at the top we have the hole 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.050
 where the knife enters 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.840
 Inside, a magnet keeps it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.489
 let it fall we introduce the knife 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.489
 leaving the side careful out 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.580
 then we retell the parts of the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580
 Knife holder rotating 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.430
 the knife will begin to join in the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.440
 top here is very important 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.620
 note that the knife should only 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.020
 stand out 2 millimeters nothing more and nothing 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.420
 less and that begins to measure the cuts 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.400
 They must be perfect once 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.980
 established the measure we will move the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.750
 golden nut towards the tip this 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.750
 will allow to fix the measurement of the knife 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.610
 once you saw that this was good 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.620
 we can tighten it with more force also 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.330
 the parameters of force must be handled 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.120
 in the machine to increase the precision 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.830
 Cutting the cutting speed too 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.070
 it is a parameter to consider at the moment 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.320
 cutting a high speed is for 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.410
 simple cuts and a low speed is 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.240
 for cutting with many details we will put 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.730
 now the knife in the head of the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.230
 projectile always remember to the extent 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 of two milliliters from the tip of the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.750
 knife that should protrude from the holder 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.750
 two chinese 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.300
 let go of the head adjustment wheel 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.300
 and we introduce the portal stabbed 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.069
 the knife port has its part 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.409
 plastic a margin 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.810
 this must be pressed against 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.290
 of the head of power giving a measure 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.290
 correct 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.190
 we turn the adjustment knob to leave 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.190
 pressed the knife holder 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.560
 how can we see this margin 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.610
 plastic that I adjust on the head 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.610
 giving the perfect measure 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.080
