 *** ET L'EXTRA-TARAT *** *** SUBS BY: AwesomeSuitGuy *** 

00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.100
 Uncle, how good it's late ... 

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.200
 I prefer to be here 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.033
 at my house... 

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:07.901
 Coupled ... 

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:08.968
 You will want to say to my house. 

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:11.000
 You do not call me coupled, 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.567
 piece of cocoon 

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.067
 Uncle ... 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.534
 I'll get this wrist so that with the open hand, 

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.067
 I will even hear it in Uranus. 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.234
 You have no balls. 

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:24.334
 * RIUEN * 

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:25.133
 Eh! 

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:25.934
 Oh no guy ...! 

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:27.200
 It's the man of the raincoat! 

00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:29.500
 Collons, it's the man of the raincoat! 

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:32.434
 I'm the man in the raincoat! 

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:37.634
 * They call * 

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.067
 Look, we've found your ship. 

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.033
 Escapes now, nano. 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.209
 I will miss you. 

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.500
 And I will miss you to find. 

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.113
 Eeeeehh! 

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:50.601
 Shit, the screen has changed again ... 

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.267
 ... we are in france 

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.868
 In France or on the planet of giant letters? 

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:56.167
 Already, already. 

00:00:56.868 --> 00:00:58.968
 Hey, you know how you say to Argentina? 

00:00:59.167 --> 00:00:59.734
 How 

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.033
 "Ehte boludo"! 

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:05.534
 No puta grace 

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:07.701
 Man of the Gavardina! 

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.167
 Uncle, it's the Gavardina Man! 

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:10.067
 Oh! 

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.067
 Man of the Gavardina! 

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:15.934
 Wake up ET! 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.367
 Oh, it was a dream ... Where am I? 

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:23.116
 You've fallen into my game marijuana and you've smoked it all! 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.067
 Exit from there, cony! 

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:26.367
 I do not feel like it! 

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.824
 Oh, when stretching my neck I can fly! 

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:32.567
 How bad is the drug ... 

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.995
 I can not stop flying! 

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:37.301
 Oh! 

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:38.200
 Willy! 

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.767
 What a nightmare! 

00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:42.400
 I've dreamed that ET outsiders are a game ... 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.133
 ... of Atari 2600 badly programmed. 

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.300
 * PUBLIC FEATURES * 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.367
 It's good that we live in a badly programmed Master System game, huh? 

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.367
 * PUBLIC FEATURES * 

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:52.500
 Yes, Willy. 

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.701
 There's no problem! 

00:01:58.667 --> 00:01:59.868
 In short, family ... 

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.300
 I'm around Melmac ... 

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.234
 What awaits me in Master Chef, 

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:05.367
 and will flip when I teach them ... 

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.801
 ... my Siamese cat ... 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.667
 ... at the orange ... 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.934
 * PUBLIC FEATURES * 

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:11.067
 Will you ever come back? 

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:12.200
 Of course! 

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.934
 Tell those of NASA ... 

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.234
 ... they let me know when they invent the internet. 

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:16.901
 * PUBLIC FEATURES * 

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:19.133
 Something tells me that it will be full of videos ... 

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.701
 ... Tasty cats every day! 

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.934
 * PUBLIC FEATURES * 

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.133
 Man of the Gavardina! 

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.767
 Man of the Gavardina! 

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.901
 No Willy! 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.834
 Damn you, Man of the Gavardina! 

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:34.901
 Man of the Gavardina! 

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.567
 Collons uncle ... 

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:37.934
 This can not continue like this ... 

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:40.400
 ... I have to leave this shit for a good time! 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.100
 My hippie 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.133
 Good morning, Hippie and ET! 

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.801
 Do you like a dog sandwich? 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.970
 I have seen that there is no cat in this house ... 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.133
 And you know that I am open to new worlds! 

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.067
 * RISE THE THREE AND THE PUBLIC * 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.801
 Putas the eighties, uncle. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.380
 Putas the eighties. 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.880
 Uncle 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 Why do you get your eggs in the air? 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.500
 What you say? 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 It's my other arm, idiot! 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.020
 It's pure perspective! 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.560
 Oh, I'm sorry! 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.420
 Now you get away, nobody laughed at my graphics ... 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.800
 I'm back to the desert! 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.200
 And this time I do not win! 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 * THREE THOUSANDS * Man from Gavardina! 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.800
