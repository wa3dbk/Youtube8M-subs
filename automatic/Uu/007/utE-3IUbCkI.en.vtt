here but the important part to realize

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
here but the important part to realize
with<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> details<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.840> most<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> time

fixtures so don't feel like you need to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810 
fixtures so don't feel like you need to
stick<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.930> particular<00:01:37.590> style<00:01:37.920> another

thing that I think is really interesting

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200 
thing that I think is really interesting
is<00:01:40.650> knowing<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> history<00:01:41.159> behind<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.790> piece<00:01:41.970> so
