00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.980 
around to trying out the shotguns and
ghosts

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
ghosts

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.900 
ghosts
it<00:00:07.290> must<00:00:07.500> have<00:00:07.649> played<00:00:07.799> about<00:00:08.010> four<00:00:08.340> hours<00:00:08.700> now

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
it must have played about four hours now

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.060 
it must have played about four hours now
trying<00:00:09.660> out<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> different<00:00:10.380> shotguns

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
trying out all the different shotguns

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.789 
trying out all the different shotguns
and<00:00:11.840> before<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.230> which<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> think

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
and before I get into which one I think

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.350 
and before I get into which one I think
is<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> best<00:00:14.340> even<00:00:14.759> though<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.910> could<00:00:15.059> see<00:00:15.240> it

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
is the best even though you could see it

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.910 
is the best even though you could see it
in<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> video<00:00:16.910> let<00:00:17.910> me<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.180> say<00:00:18.920> shotguns

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
in the video let me just say shotguns

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.150 
in the video let me just say shotguns
are<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.939> good<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.630> game<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.260> lot<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
are not good in this game a lot of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950 
are not good in this game a lot of
people<00:00:23.400> message<00:00:23.970> me<00:00:24.000> saying<00:00:24.420> how<00:00:24.600> bad<00:00:24.779> they

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
people message me saying how bad they

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.130 
people message me saying how bad they
were

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
were

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.120 
were
and<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:26.099> true<00:00:26.640> there's<00:00:27.480> no<00:00:27.840> reason<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and it's true there's no reason for you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.939 
and it's true there's no reason for you
to<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> shotgun<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.750> game<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.650> that's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to use a shotgun in this game now that's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
to use a shotgun in this game now that's
kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> lame<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.960> shotguns<00:00:33.960> have

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
kind of lame because shotguns have

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.200 
kind of lame because shotguns have
always<00:00:34.290> been<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.829> fun<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> use<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.579> FPS

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
always been really fun to use in FPS

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.369 
always been really fun to use in FPS
games<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.100> it's<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.120> guns<00:00:39.570> being

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
games and it's really not the guns being

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
games and it's really not the guns being
weak<00:00:40.649> although<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.550> gonna<00:00:41.670> encounter<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
weak although you're gonna encounter a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
weak although you're gonna encounter a
lot<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> good<00:00:42.629> markers<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.290> whatnot<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.950> it's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
lot of good markers and whatnot but it's

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.389 
lot of good markers and whatnot but it's
not<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> guns<00:00:46.200> needing<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> buff<00:00:46.980> it's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
not about the guns needing a buff it's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.479 
not about the guns needing a buff it's
about<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.210> map<00:00:48.450> design<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.289> game<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
about the map design in this game it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
about the map design in this game it
doesn't<00:00:50.730> work<00:00:51.000> well<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.570> you're<00:00:51.719> using<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
doesn't work well if you're using a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.250 
doesn't work well if you're using a
shotgun<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> shotgun

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
shotgun because when you use a shotgun

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
shotgun because when you use a shotgun
you<00:00:55.260> never<00:00:55.410> could<00:00:55.680> kill<00:00:55.890> across<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> map<00:00:56.579> like

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you never could kill across the map like

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.299 
you never could kill across the map like
his<00:00:57.239> fastball<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> modern<00:00:58.020> warfare<00:00:58.170> 2<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
his fastball of a modern warfare 2 you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.420 
his fastball of a modern warfare 2 you
still<00:00:59.550> had<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.710> at<00:01:01.710> least<00:01:01.890> medium

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
still had to be you know at least medium

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.350 
still had to be you know at least medium
range<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.369> behind<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
range and in this game to get behind the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.929 
range and in this game to get behind the
other<00:01:06.689> team<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:08.189> freaking<00:01:08.700> hard

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
other team is pretty freaking hard

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
other team is pretty freaking hard
because<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.320> trying<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> make<00:01:10.710> your

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
because if you're trying to make your

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
because if you're trying to make your
way<00:01:10.979> around<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> map<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:12.510> gonna

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
way around the map you're gonna

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
way around the map you're gonna
encounter<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.380> vertical<00:01:13.979> spot<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> window

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
encounter a vertical spot like a window

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.899 
encounter a vertical spot like a window
or<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.479> rooftop<00:01:15.979> every<00:01:16.979> single<00:01:17.280> map<00:01:17.400> has<00:01:17.640> them

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
or a rooftop every single map has them

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.460 
or a rooftop every single map has them
and<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.509> got<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> shotgun<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.380> on

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and if you got a shotgun and you're on

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
and if you got a shotgun and you're on
ground<00:01:19.770> level<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.880> don't<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> chance

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
ground level you don't have a chance

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.649 
ground level you don't have a chance
against<00:01:22.320> someone<00:01:22.650> sitting<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> roof<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.659> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
against someone sitting on a roof and a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
against someone sitting on a roof and a
lot<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> maps<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.409> designed<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
lot of the maps are designed like that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.749 
lot of the maps are designed like that
so<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.360> how<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> game<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
so that's just how it is in the game I

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
so that's just how it is in the game I
personally<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.119> recommend<00:01:30.540> using<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
personally do not recommend using a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.620 
personally do not recommend using a
shotgun<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:32.790> fun<00:01:33.119> factor<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:34.700> pretty<00:01:35.700> low<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
shotgun the fun factor is pretty low it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.069 
shotgun the fun factor is pretty low it
could<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.960> fun<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.590> moments<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.990> once<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
could be fun for moments but once you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.390 
could be fun for moments but once you
kill<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.409> three<00:01:40.619> guys<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> think

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
kill like three guys and you think

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
kill like three guys and you think
you're<00:01:41.490> gonna<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.790> quad<00:01:42.140> you're<00:01:43.140> probably

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you're gonna get a quad you're probably

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.530 
you're gonna get a quad you're probably
gonna<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> hitmarker

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
gonna get a hitmarker

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
gonna get a hitmarker
no<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:46.860> doesn't<00:01:47.340> make<00:01:47.430> as

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
no but it's just it just doesn't make as

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
no but it's just it just doesn't make as
much<00:01:47.790> sense<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> scene<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> shotgun

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
much sense in the scene from the shotgun

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
much sense in the scene from the shotgun
as<00:01:49.500> opposed<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> simply<00:01:50.280> using<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.820> assault

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
as opposed to simply using an assault

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
as opposed to simply using an assault

the<00:02:13.769> TAC<00:02:14.010> 12<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:15.120> course<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.599> doesn't<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:16.019> as

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the TAC 12 of course it doesn't get as

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.979 
the TAC 12 of course it doesn't get as
many<00:02:16.290> one-shot<00:02:16.830> kills<00:02:17.160> as<00:02:17.519> why<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.150> fp6<00:02:18.720> for

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
many one-shot kills as why the fp6 for

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.530 
many one-shot kills as why the fp6 for

shotguns<00:02:51.260> other<00:02:52.260> game<00:02:52.530> modes<00:02:52.769> work<00:02:53.010> too<00:02:53.250> but

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
shotguns other game modes work too but

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.670 
shotguns other game modes work too but

and aiming down sights does seem to get
a<00:03:35.819> better<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.410> tighter<00:03:37.709> spread<00:03:38.160> but<00:03:38.400> I'm

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
a better like a tighter spread but I'm

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.339 
a better like a tighter spread but I'm
not<00:03:38.819> positive<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.389> don't<00:03:39.480> run<00:03:39.690> any<00:03:39.840> tests<00:03:40.260> on

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
not positive I don't run any tests on

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.819 
not positive I don't run any tests on
this<00:03:40.500> stuff<00:03:40.769> but<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:41.910> seems<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.650> last

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
this stuff but it just seems to the last

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.500 
this stuff but it just seems to the last
perk<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.220> got<00:03:44.370> gambler<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.209> because<00:03:45.359> it's

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
perk I got gambler on just because it's

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.020 
perk I got gambler on just because it's
funny<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.709> seeing<00:03:47.069> what<00:03:47.250> random<00:03:47.609> perk<00:03:47.819> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
funny I like seeing what random perk it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.659 
funny I like seeing what random perk it
gives<00:03:48.209> me<00:03:48.419> and<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.950> gun<00:03:50.099> itself<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.549> got

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
gives me and on the gun itself I got

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.569 
gives me and on the gun itself I got
extended<00:03:51.060> mags<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.840> muzzle<00:03:52.410> brake<00:03:52.680> not<00:03:53.280> sure

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
extended mags and muzzle brake not sure

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.849 
extended mags and muzzle brake not sure
about<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.690> differences<00:03:55.169> in<00:03:55.230> muzzle<00:03:55.650> break

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
about the differences in muzzle break

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.710 
about the differences in muzzle break
but<00:03:56.190> you're<00:03:56.340> very<00:03:56.489> limited<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.090> choices

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
but you're very limited in your choices

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.770 
but you're very limited in your choices
for<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.230> gun<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:58.769> put<00:03:59.489> it<00:03:59.579> on<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.209> can't<00:04:00.480> hurt

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
for the gun so put it on it can't hurt

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.559 
for the gun so put it on it can't hurt
and

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.140 
and
this<00:04:03.349> this<00:04:03.739> isn't<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.040> best<00:04:04.249> gameplay<00:04:04.519> by<00:04:04.999> any

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
this this isn't the best gameplay by any

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.929 
this this isn't the best gameplay by any
means<00:04:05.390> but<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.799> just<00:04:07.069> one<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.609> get<00:04:07.790> I

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
means but this was just one that I get I

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.509 
means but this was just one that I get I
got<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.180> slapped<00:04:08.569> on<00:04:08.749> this<00:04:08.900> class<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:09.560> probably

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
got I slapped on this class and probably

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.449 
got I slapped on this class and probably
three<00:04:10.730> games<00:04:10.969> then<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.569> got<00:04:12.139> this<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.829> know

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
three games then I got this and you know

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.550 
three games then I got this and you know
you<00:04:13.519> don't<00:04:13.730> end<00:04:13.939> up<00:04:14.030> doing<00:04:14.329> that<00:04:14.719> poorly<00:04:15.200> with

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
you don't end up doing that poorly with

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.920 
you don't end up doing that poorly with
the<00:04:15.620> shotgun<00:04:15.859> it's<00:04:16.639> just<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.780> could

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
the shotgun it's just that you could

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.520 
the shotgun it's just that you could
only<00:04:18.199> do<00:04:18.470> better<00:04:18.799> using<00:04:19.310> an<00:04:19.639> assault<00:04:19.970> rifle

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
only do better using an assault rifle

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.930 
only do better using an assault rifle
and<00:04:21.530> that's<00:04:21.859> where<00:04:22.099> the<00:04:22.250> fun<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.520> kind<00:04:22.849> of

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
and that's where the fun is kind of

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.960 
and that's where the fun is kind of
taken<00:04:23.210> out<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.389> it<00:04:23.690> because<00:04:24.020> no<00:04:24.740> one<00:04:24.889> likes<00:04:25.099> to

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
taken out of it because no one likes to

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.370 
taken out of it because no one likes to
think<00:04:26.150> oh<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.330> could<00:04:26.630> them<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:26.990> much<00:04:27.139> better

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
think oh I could them so much better

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.680 
think oh I could them so much better
with<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> different<00:04:28.009> gun<00:04:28.270> because<00:04:29.270> every<00:04:29.599> other

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
with a different gun because every other

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.060 
with a different gun because every other
gun<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.139> game<00:04:30.289> is<00:04:30.560> basically<00:04:31.009> equal<00:04:31.759> so

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
gun in the game is basically equal so

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.560 
gun in the game is basically equal so
shotguns<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.370> verdict<00:04:34.759> from<00:04:34.970> me<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.360> that

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
shotguns the verdict from me is that

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.339 
shotguns the verdict from me is that
they're<00:04:36.500> just<00:04:36.770> not<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.160> good<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:38.349> mainly

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
they're just not that good and mainly

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.830 
they're just not that good and mainly
due<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.860> maps<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.699> know<00:04:40.849> I<00:04:41.090> don't<00:04:41.570> care<00:04:41.630> if

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
due to the maps you know I don't care if

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.050 
due to the maps you know I don't care if
you<00:04:41.930> make<00:04:42.050> them<00:04:42.199> stronger<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:43.610> still<00:04:43.880> gotta

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
you make them stronger you still gotta

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.879 
you make them stronger you still gotta
get<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.599> other<00:04:44.690> team<00:04:44.990> and<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.349> takes<00:04:45.590> a

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
get to the other team and that takes a

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.180 
get to the other team and that takes a
lot<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.430> patience<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.270> lot<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.289> trying<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:48.979> work

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
lot of patience a lot of trying to work

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.800 
lot of patience a lot of trying to work
your<00:04:49.370> way<00:04:49.490> around<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.789> outside<00:04:50.389> of<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.570> map

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
your way around the outside of the map

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.770 
your way around the outside of the map
so<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:51.440> actually<00:04:51.889> slows<00:04:52.310> down<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.150> game<00:04:53.180> as

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
so it actually slows down the game as

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.570 
so it actually slows down the game as
opposed<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.349> slapping<00:04:54.800> on<00:04:54.919> another<00:04:55.160> gun<00:04:55.370> and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
opposed to slapping on another gun and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.029 
opposed to slapping on another gun and
just<00:04:55.699> you<00:04:56.690> know<00:04:56.750> go<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.080> guns<00:04:57.349> blazing<00:04:57.889> right

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
just you know go in guns blazing right

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.279 
just you know go in guns blazing right
through<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.370> middle<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.780> chalk<00:05:00.050> gun

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
through the middle the chalk gun

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.730 
through the middle the chalk gun
definitely<00:05:01.220> slows<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.639> down<00:05:01.669> a<00:05:01.820> bit<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.740> like

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
definitely slows it down a bit and like

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.249 
definitely slows it down a bit and like
I<00:05:03.860> said<00:05:03.919> requires<00:05:04.460> patience<00:05:05.240> but<00:05:05.509> eventually

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
I said requires patience but eventually

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.409 
I said requires patience but eventually
once<00:05:07.009> you<00:05:07.099> learn<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.400> Maps<00:05:07.610> better<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.300> all

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
once you learn the Maps better and all

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.480 
once you learn the Maps better and all
that<00:05:08.630> you'll<00:05:09.470> find<00:05:09.830> your<00:05:09.979> way<00:05:10.070> behind<00:05:10.430> the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
that you'll find your way behind the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.129 
that you'll find your way behind the
other<00:05:10.610> team<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:11.060> does<00:05:11.240> feel<00:05:11.479> good<00:05:11.509> to<00:05:11.990> take

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
other team it does feel good to take

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.870 
other team it does feel good to take
down<00:05:12.349> like<00:05:12.590> four<00:05:12.860> guys<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.460> four<00:05:13.669> shots

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
down like four guys and four shots

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.140 
down like four guys and four shots
that's<00:05:14.360> always<00:05:14.539> awesome<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:16.280> it's<00:05:16.789> a<00:05:16.940> little

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
that's always awesome but it's a little

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.089 
that's always awesome but it's a little
upsetting<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.870> it's<00:05:18.080> not<00:05:18.320> as<00:05:18.650> good<00:05:18.830> as<00:05:18.889> I

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
upsetting that it's not as good as I

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.969 
upsetting that it's not as good as I
hoped<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:20.020> who<00:05:21.020> knows<00:05:21.199> maybe<00:05:21.229> with<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.830> new

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
hoped and who knows maybe with the new

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.680 
hoped and who knows maybe with the new
map<00:05:22.130> packs<00:05:22.430> it'll<00:05:22.820> get<00:05:22.970> better<00:05:23.180> if<00:05:23.479> there's

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
map packs it'll get better if there's
