have to get something that is imported
from<00:03:05.319> someplace<00:03:05.770> else<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:06.910> actually<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:07.540> just

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
from someplace else but actually we just

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.360 
from someplace else but actually we just
have<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.050> tremendous<00:03:08.530> number<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.830> extremely

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
have a tremendous number of extremely

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.370 
have a tremendous number of extremely
beautiful<00:03:09.490> plants<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.209> grow<00:03:10.840> native<00:03:11.110> in

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
beautiful plants that grow native in

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.100 
beautiful plants that grow native in
this<00:03:11.530> area<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.190> we<00:03:13.090> should<00:03:13.300> really<00:03:13.900> be

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
this area and we should really be

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.670 
this area and we should really be
excited<00:03:14.500> about<00:03:14.560> those<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:16.380> hope<00:03:17.380> people<00:03:17.530> take

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
excited about those I hope people take

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.350 
excited about those I hope people take
away<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.160> native<00:03:18.430> plants<00:03:18.760> can<00:03:18.970> be<00:03:19.000> pretty

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
away that native plants can be pretty

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.809 
away that native plants can be pretty
and<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:19.959> used<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.980> home<00:03:21.190> garden<00:03:21.400> and

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
and can be used in the home garden and

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.120 
and can be used in the home garden and
that<00:03:22.000> there's<00:03:22.360> really<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.840> plant<00:03:23.709> animal

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
that there's really a plant animal

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.650 
that there's really a plant animal
connection<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.700> happens<00:03:25.090> when<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.510> get<00:03:25.600> a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
connection that happens when you get a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.000 
connection that happens when you get a
big<00:03:25.870> group<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.200> native<00:03:26.500> plants<00:03:26.830> together<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
big group of native plants together I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.910 
big group of native plants together I
think<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.600> have<00:03:31.959> people<00:03:32.440> use

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
think that if we can have people use

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.870 
think that if we can have people use
these<00:03:33.300> versus<00:03:34.300> exotics<00:03:35.340> people<00:03:36.340> would<00:03:36.519> will

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
these versus exotics people would will

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.699 
these versus exotics people would will
find<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.420> there'll<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:37.660> more<00:03:37.780> animals<00:03:38.500> in

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
find that there'll be more animals in

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.330 
find that there'll be more animals in
their<00:03:39.130> gardens<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.900> that's<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.709> part<00:03:42.190> of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
their gardens and that's just part of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.250 
their gardens and that's just part of
the<00:03:42.400> whole<00:03:42.730> bigger<00:03:43.300> process<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:44.080> we<00:03:44.230> need

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
the whole bigger process that we need

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.670 
the whole bigger process that we need
those<00:03:44.800> insects<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.670> animals<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.989> pollinate

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
those insects and animals to pollinate

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:58.260 
those insects and animals to pollinate
and<00:03:48.670> in<00:03:48.940> order<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.510> keep<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.320> food<00:03:50.650> web<00:03:50.890> going

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.059 

well<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.300> hope<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.750> an<00:03:59.870> emotional<00:04:00.140> level<00:04:00.590> people

to take away with them beauty the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.660 
to take away with them beauty the
natural<00:04:05.450> root<00:04:05.629> world<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.170> beautiful<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:07.370> can

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
natural root world is beautiful it can

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.140 
natural root world is beautiful it can
enrich<00:04:07.849> us<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:09.290> can<00:04:09.530> add<00:04:09.739> to<00:04:09.980> our<00:04:10.129> lives<00:04:10.459> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
then in more specific ways learning some

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.569 
then in more specific ways learning some
of<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.780> native<00:04:15.590> plants<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:16.040> we<00:04:16.250> have<00:04:16.280> on

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
of the native plants that we have on

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.969 
of the native plants that we have on
display<00:04:16.760> here<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:17.600> when<00:04:17.780> they<00:04:17.900> people<00:04:18.680> drive

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
display here so when they people drive

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.500 
display here so when they people drive
along<00:04:19.340> in<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.609> road<00:04:19.820> they<00:04:20.030> might<00:04:20.209> see

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
along in the road they might see

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.060 
along in the road they might see
something<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:21.079> they've<00:04:21.350> actually<00:04:21.590> seen

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
something that they've actually seen

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.490 
something that they've actually seen
here<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.580> will<00:04:22.729> know<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.900> milkweeds

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
here it will know that the milkweeds

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.520 
here it will know that the milkweeds
along<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.190> roadside<00:04:25.790> are<00:04:26.330> valuable<00:04:27.080> plants

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
along the roadside are valuable plants

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.560 
along the roadside are valuable plants
that<00:04:27.680> they're<00:04:27.889> nourishing<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.120> monarch
