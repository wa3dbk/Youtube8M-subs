00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.540 

looks<00:02:52.900> better<00:02:53.110> he's<00:02:53.290> gotten<00:02:53.410> over<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550

for<00:03:04.590> some<00:03:04.739> reason<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.010> thought<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.280> red<00:03:05.489> tag

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
for some reason I thought that red tag

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:16.050 
for some reason I thought that red tag
was<00:03:05.879> opposed<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.390> enemy

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.580 

invigorating<00:03:17.060> whoops<00:03:18.050> didn't<00:03:18.320> mean<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.470> leap

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
invigorating whoops didn't mean to leap

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:42.570 
invigorating whoops didn't mean to leap
up<00:03:18.710> that<00:03:18.920> way

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:04:07.310 

stand<00:03:43.580> your<00:03:43.700> ground

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.230 

yeah<00:04:08.320> at<00:04:08.830> least<00:04:08.980> I'm<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.370> said<00:04:09.700> I'm<00:04:09.880> not<00:04:09.910> getting

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
yeah at least I'm I said I'm not getting

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.620 
yeah at least I'm I said I'm not getting
much<00:04:10.390> formats<00:04:11.020> hit<00:04:11.880> seem<00:04:12.880> like<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.270> not

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
much formats hit seem like it's not

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.370 
much formats hit seem like it's not
dropping<00:04:14.110> any<00:04:14.560> frames<00:04:14.650> while<00:04:15.130> recording<00:04:15.610> a

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
dropping any frames while recording a

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.560 
dropping any frames while recording a
play<00:04:17.380> looks<00:04:18.100> really<00:04:18.370> good<00:04:18.580> on<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.970> video<00:04:19.180> I'll

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
play looks really good on the video I'll

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.090 
play looks really good on the video I'll
played<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:20.230> my<00:04:20.320> side<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.650> if<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.860> looks<00:04:21.010> good

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
played on my side and if it looks good

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.590 
played on my side and if it looks good
you<00:04:21.760> guys<00:04:21.910> will<00:04:22.060> see<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.330> on<00:04:22.480> youtube<00:04:24.600> I'm

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
you guys will see this on youtube I'm

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.480 
you guys will see this on youtube I'm
actually<00:04:25.870> recording<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.620> at<00:04:26.740> 50<00:04:27.040> megabits<00:04:27.370> per

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
actually recording it at 50 megabits per

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.190 
actually recording it at 50 megabits per
second<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.060> i'm<00:04:28.210> thinking<00:04:28.510> i<00:04:28.600> might<00:04:28.840> take<00:04:29.110> it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
second but i'm thinking i might take it

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.710 
second but i'm thinking i might take it
into<00:04:29.260> ffmpeg<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.220> be<00:04:30.400> encoded<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:31.420> just

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
into ffmpeg and be encoded and just

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.120 
into ffmpeg and be encoded and just
slightly<00:04:31.870> lower<00:04:32.200> bitrate<00:04:32.560> I'm<00:04:32.950> just

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
slightly lower bitrate I'm just

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.470 
slightly lower bitrate I'm just
recording<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.610> at<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.760> really<00:04:33.970> high<00:04:34.060> bit<00:04:34.450> rate

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
recording it at a really high bit rate

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.470 
recording it at a really high bit rate
so<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.470> way<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.790> know<00:04:36.850> it<00:04:37.000> doesn't<00:04:37.270> get<00:04:37.420> any

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
so that way you know it doesn't get any

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.390 
so that way you know it doesn't get any
quality<00:04:38.230> loss<00:04:38.410> because<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.800> can<00:04:38.950> always

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.310 

reincorporate<00:04:42.400> but<00:04:42.700> at<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.880> higher<00:04:43.320> x264

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
reincorporate but at a higher x264

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.710 
reincorporate but at a higher x264
presets<00:04:45.010> oh<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.640> does<00:04:45.790> better<00:04:46.030> quality<00:04:46.540> horses

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
presets oh it does better quality horses

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.620 
presets oh it does better quality horses
and<00:04:47.230> do<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.890> faster<00:04:48.460> preset<00:04:48.940> well<00:04:49.180> so<00:04:49.390> that<00:04:49.540> way

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
and do it faster preset well so that way

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.740 
and do it faster preset well so that way
does<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:49.990> good<00:04:50.140> on<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.410> cords<00:04:51.010> bit<00:04:51.610> on<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.820> fly

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.270 

what<00:04:55.750> brings<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.110> here

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.410
