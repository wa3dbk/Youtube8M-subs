00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.210
 look at another video responding today and 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.730
 mails 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 many ask me to go the trip 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 from 4 to 12 millimeters can 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.699
 which pillar the bamboo or to be round 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.970
 baryta bamboo 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.980
 Let me try it some time ago. 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.859
 today as I have more time in the wood 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 Mounted on bench was life 2 bearings 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.370
 but it is the same system of the fipe slope a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 this is also the most 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.890
 old one I had in my workshop 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.890
 I'll show you she make sticks 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.469
 Wood 5000 and also links 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 bamboo rods which was a great 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.300
 result 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.050
 come on then this uphill tv was 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.579
 with two small bankers is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.739
 stop this 25mm also very 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 good to ride a quiet neira 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 Kiss she does not change in kiss 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.650
 the axis size or even changes only the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.110
 bearing and bearing 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.869
 she behaves very well because the police 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.619
 stay in the middle so she's up to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.880
 stability that this lame a cause 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.060
 or a double regulation is placed which 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:35.030
 I recommend it and put it right next 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.030
 the strawberry so that in the end do not turn the flask 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.219
 [Music] 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:51.550

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.790
 [Music] 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:15.720
 the fish was quite quiet and the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.210
 perfect noisy this was made of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.840
 a pretty hard way practically 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.800
 dragged sanded very lisinha nearby 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.440
 same 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.310
 This is going to depend on the wood now. Let's go. 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 see how it works on bamboo and here it is 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.910
 would have to cut bamboo 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.910
 let's go then 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.829
 rice to chirp will not see me now 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.390
 just try the caterpillar deira 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.390
 5mm press we will see 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.590
 [Music] 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.980
 [Music] 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.089
 [Music] 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.280
 and here is the bamboo and the wood has no 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.050
 no difference 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.600
 the fesa super normal staff the bamboo where 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.810
 the difficulty will be you find the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 Bamboo in the thick so it looks good 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.230
 plump kiss some parts look good 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.230
 realistic 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:09.360
 ben rhodes the finish is perfect in the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.880
 very normal bamboo now guide her like 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.550
 is the correct measure and the bamboo sometimes 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.239
 not so correct then it can be 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.610
 even without the guide or the guide 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.460
 more open but there it is 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.100
 was the test I had already done this 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.860
 test but was still in doubt and not 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.010
 I wanted to recommend but today I recommend 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.590
