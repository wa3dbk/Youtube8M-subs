00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
everybody got different point values and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
everybody got different point values and
together<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.030> came<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> conclusion

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
together we came up with the conclusion

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.420 
together we came up with the conclusion
that<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:34.530> whole<00:01:34.770> thing<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.280> made

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that the whole thing was it just made

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
that the whole thing was it just made
sense<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.090> everything<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.110> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
sense that everything was like that so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.490 
sense that everything was like that so
got<00:01:40.860> four<00:01:41.130> kills<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.720> kid<00:01:43.110> over<00:01:43.470> here

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
got four kills now this kid over here

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
got four kills now this kid over here
some<00:01:43.920> stupid<00:01:44.460> second<00:01:44.939> chance<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.630> get

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
some stupid second chance I don't get

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.039 
some stupid second chance I don't get
how<00:01:45.899> he<00:01:45.930> throws<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> frag<00:01:46.950> while<00:01:47.310> he's<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
how he throws a frag while he's in it

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.200 
how he throws a frag while he's in it
that<00:01:49.049> makes<00:01:49.530> no<00:01:49.740> sense<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.369> he<00:01:50.549> blows<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that makes no sense but he blows up that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.800 
that makes no sense but he blows up that
barrel<00:01:51.570> boo<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.380> win<00:01:55.939> because<00:01:56.939> it's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
barrel boo and here we win because it's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
barrel boo and here we win because it's
