and<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.100> set<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:43.159> thread<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and just set this up on top thread this

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.139 
and just set this up on top thread this
up<00:01:45.499> and<00:01:46.499> I'm<00:01:46.799> gonna<00:01:46.950> adjust<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.459> monitor<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
up and I'm gonna adjust the monitor to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.230 
up and I'm gonna adjust the monitor to
where<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> my<00:01:49.289> field<00:01:49.499> of<00:01:49.709> view

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
where it's just out of my field of view

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
where it's just out of my field of view
and<00:01:51.259> lock<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> down<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:53.159> there<00:01:54.679> all<00:01:55.679> right

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and lock it down right there all right

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440 
and lock it down right there all right
now<00:01:56.249> because<00:01:56.459> there's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> strap<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> way

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
now because there's a strap in the way

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.910 
now because there's a strap in the way
that<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.719> locks<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.499> spring<00:01:58.679> load

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that this locks down in the spring load

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.489 
that this locks down in the spring load
it's<00:01:59.520> it's<00:02:00.149> extremely<00:02:00.509> strong<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> mean<00:02:01.350> it's

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
it's it's extremely strong I mean it's

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.989 
it's it's extremely strong I mean it's
not<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.859> pop<00:02:02.069> off<00:02:02.249> it's<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
not going to pop off it's not going to

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.249 
not going to pop off it's not going to
fall<00:02:03.240> off<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.539> don't<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.899> worry<00:02:04.109> about

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
fall off you don't have to worry about

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.769 
fall off you don't have to worry about
this<00:02:04.740> being<00:02:05.009> too<00:02:05.159> secure<00:02:05.639> now<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
this being too secure now with the

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.430 
this being too secure now with the
monitor<00:02:07.139> up<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
monitor up here and

your<00:02:13.330> transmitter<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> flaw<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.770> is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
your transmitter but the flaw to that is

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.740 
your transmitter but the flaw to that is
is<00:02:15.250> if<00:02:15.400> you're<00:02:15.520> flying<00:02:15.700> your<00:02:15.880> airplane<00:02:16.210> you've

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
is if you're flying your airplane you've

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.840 
is if you're flying your airplane you've
got<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.960> look<00:02:17.050> down<00:02:17.110> at<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:18.490> other<00:02:18.610> thing

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
got to look down at it the other thing

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.090 
got to look down at it the other thing
is<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> goggles<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.780> if<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.740> were<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.070> a

is the goggles is if you were to have a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.910 
is the goggles is if you were to have a
problem<00:02:21.370> or<00:02:21.670> lose<00:02:22.120> orientation<00:02:23.020> need<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.740> pop

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
problem or lose orientation need to pop

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.500 
problem or lose orientation need to pop
those<00:02:24.100> off<00:02:24.310> real<00:02:24.850> quick<00:02:25.060> you've<00:02:25.210> got<00:02:25.360> to

those off real quick you've got to

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.670 
those off real quick you've got to
search<00:02:25.660> around<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.110> where<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.350> airplane<00:02:26.650> is

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
search around for where your airplane is

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.010 
search around for where your airplane is

your<00:02:34.780> aircraft<00:02:35.200> take<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> look<00:02:35.800> at<00:02:35.890> what<00:02:36.100> you're

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
your aircraft take a look at what you're

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800 
your aircraft take a look at what you're
seeing<00:02:36.460> there<00:02:36.700> or<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:37.090> looking<00:02:37.240> at<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> there

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
seeing there or be looking at it there

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.540 
seeing there or be looking at it there
and<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:37.990> look<00:02:38.290> back<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.740> forth<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.490> you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
and just look back and forth so you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.770 
and just look back and forth so you
don't<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.880> look<00:02:40.030> down<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.540> actually

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
don't have to look down so it actually

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.110 
don't have to look down so it actually
is<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.920> convenient<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.730> other<00:02:42.880> cool

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
is really convenient and the other cool

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.240 
is really convenient and the other cool
thing<00:02:43.330> about<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.410> since<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.130> a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
thing about this is is that since it's a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.910 
thing about this is is that since it's a
variable<00:02:45.910> adjustable<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.900> can<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.680> ahead<00:02:47.770> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
variable adjustable you can go ahead and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.620 
variable adjustable you can go ahead and
loosen<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.060> kick<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.390> here

just<00:03:30.340> goggles<00:03:30.730> don't<00:03:30.910> work<00:03:31.090> for<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.680> it's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
just goggles don't work for and and it's

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.410 
just goggles don't work for and and it's
awesome<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.640> mean<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:34.030> it's<00:03:34.239> fairly

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
awesome I mean and it's fairly

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.479 
awesome I mean and it's fairly
inexpensive<00:03:34.720> now<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> consider<00:03:35.739> does<00:03:36.130> have<00:03:36.310> one

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
inexpensive now I consider does have one

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.310 
inexpensive now I consider does have one
additional<00:03:36.700> more<00:03:37.150> mount<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.720> goes<00:03:37.900> here<00:03:38.140> so

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
additional more mount so it goes here so

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.890 
additional more mount so it goes here so
I<00:03:38.709> mean<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.459> variable<00:03:39.820> adjustable<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.690> can

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
I mean it's variable adjustable you can

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.030 
I mean it's variable adjustable you can
put<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.290> bottom<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.739> flip<00:03:41.890> these

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
put it on the bottom and flip these

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.340 
put it on the bottom and flip these
upside<00:03:42.340> down<00:03:42.519> as<00:03:42.730> well<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.540> can<00:03:43.720> adjust<00:03:44.140> it

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
upside down as well so you can adjust it

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.170 
upside down as well so you can adjust it
pretty<00:03:44.590> much<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:44.920> any<00:03:45.010> position<00:03:45.580> switch<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.150> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
pretty much in any position switch it to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.490 
pretty much in any position switch it to
the<00:03:46.300> other<00:03:46.510> side<00:03:46.630> if<00:03:47.050> you'd<00:03:47.170> prefer<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
the other side if you'd prefer the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.590 
the other side if you'd prefer the
monitor<00:03:47.950> over<00:03:47.980> here<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:49.030> I'm<00:03:49.330> just<00:03:49.510> gonna

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
monitor over here but I'm just gonna

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.970 
monitor over here but I'm just gonna
rotate<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.140> around<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.590> guys<00:03:50.709> get<00:03:50.890> an

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
rotate that around so you guys get an

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.729 
rotate that around so you guys get an
idea<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:51.940> there<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.600> it's<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.080> shoulder

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
idea so there it is it's a shoulder

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.770 
idea so there it is it's a shoulder
mount<00:03:53.890> monitor<00:03:54.519> I'm<00:03:55.090> sure<00:03:55.300> there's<00:03:55.480> tons<00:03:55.510> of
