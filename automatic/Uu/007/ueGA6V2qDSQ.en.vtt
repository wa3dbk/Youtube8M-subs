00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
torch and you need a superglue you need

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.610 
torch and you need a superglue you need
a<00:00:58.109> good<00:00:58.440> quality<00:00:58.680> superglue<00:00:59.750> okay<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a good quality superglue okay and you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.429 
a good quality superglue okay and you
need<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> scissors<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.670> cut<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:05.990> SIM<00:01:06.990> card<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
need a scissors to cut this SIM card I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.550 
need a scissors to cut this SIM card I
got<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.860> SIM<00:01:08.189> card<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.299> cut<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
got this SIM card and I just cut in that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.070 
got this SIM card and I just cut in that
that's<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.130> same<00:01:11.369> size<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:14.180> normal<00:01:15.180> SIM

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that's the same size of the normal SIM

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.460 
that's the same size of the normal SIM
card<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
card and so you don't need this one and

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.630 
card and so you don't need this one and
after<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> cut<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.220> need<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
after you cut you don't need the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.480 
after you cut you don't need the
scissors<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.270> well<00:01:25.159> now<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> make<00:01:26.939> sure

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
scissors as well now just to make sure

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.280 
scissors as well now just to make sure
that's<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.729> same<00:01:29.970> size<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:32.420> have<00:01:33.420> got<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.930> have

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that's the same size I have got I have

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.130 
that's the same size I have got I have
got<00:01:34.439> another<00:01:34.770> sim<00:01:35.420> okay<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> same

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
got another sim okay this is the same

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.219 
got another sim okay this is the same
size<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.189> sim<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.479> I<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.720> got<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
size of that sim so and I just got a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
size of that sim so and I just got a
little<00:01:44.009> bit<00:01:44.159> plastic<00:01:44.610> bit<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.390> take<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
little bit plastic bit you can take it

you have to do fast you have to put this
plastic<00:02:01.409> bit<00:02:01.670> behind<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.030> stack<00:02:03.810> sim<00:02:04.340> okay

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
plastic bit behind the stack sim okay

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.910 
plastic bit behind the stack sim okay
very<00:02:05.909> careful<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:08.849> small

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
very careful the you know that's small

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920 
very careful the you know that's small
pins<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.370> just

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
pins I just

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.059 
pins I just
and<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:14.670> closing<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.359> properly<00:02:18.859> that's<00:02:19.859> a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and just closing it properly that's a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.759 
and just closing it properly that's a
delicate<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.670> spins<00:02:21.359> inside<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.769> will<00:02:23.340> put

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
delicate it spins inside so you will put

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.660 
delicate it spins inside so you will put
or<00:02:26.060> behave<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.359> one<00:02:27.689> so<00:02:28.049> it's<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:29.189> near<00:02:29.430> its

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
or behave that one so it's it's near its

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.399 
or behave that one so it's it's near its
needs<00:02:29.939> to<00:02:30.120> be<00:02:30.239> go<00:02:30.420> down<00:02:31.790> behind<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.409> stuck

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
needs to be go down behind the stuck

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.179 
needs to be go down behind the stuck
micro<00:02:35.159> SIM<00:02:35.400> card<00:02:36.170> till<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.409> will<00:02:37.530> find<00:02:37.859> like

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
micro SIM card till you will find like

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.789 
micro SIM card till you will find like
you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.670> already<00:02:39.060> been<00:02:39.510> at<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.349> bottom

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
you know it's already been at the bottom

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.640 
you know it's already been at the bottom
then<00:02:41.579> what<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.939> have<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.079> have<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.319> put

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
then what you have to do you have to put

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.629 
then what you have to do you have to put
a<00:02:43.889> little<00:02:44.099> bit<00:02:44.400> glue<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:47.189> the<00:02:47.400> face

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
a little bit glue on the on the face

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:57.949 
a little bit glue on the on the face
very<00:02:48.569> little<00:02:48.989> bit<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:51.079> put<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:55.669> bit<00:02:56.959> against

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
very little bit and put this bit against

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.479 
very little bit and put this bit against
that<00:02:58.109> stack<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:59.780> micro<00:03:00.780> sim<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.319> hold<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.280> for

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
that stack of micro sim and hold it for
