 enemy hillary ran the dandruff click here have to check if the excess of

 but tampon merger with Machiavellian hiring also said they beat 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.420
 absences and even having to adjust 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.150
 he speaks the language - strategic that brazil can suggest the modern company 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.440
 today is an accurate number 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.720
 because sometimes you are in a cup an activity so intensely 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.110
 competitive that I worry about freaking out 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.120
 and wants to show their opponents in the case the competitors and that they are 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.720
 really closer to you and gives you speed as you approach what you 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.230
 we have the covest in the day to day for example yet it suffers a lot with that other 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.640
 just been more creative 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 for those who think it's better we're going to fail but mass on the streets that counts 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.470
 with the advantage of an athletic point 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.570
 h2oh for example I made this spectacular idea with her to look for people 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.490
 to do what would be your decision mounted a siege on television too 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 example in print media we have examples of food because the message 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.050
 that if these people make a decision they would have read the replacement sold the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.130
 Machiavelli certainly would have done very well 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.060
 he added, however, if he allowed a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.280
 the primitive people allowed me 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.720
 one step back 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.090
 this nullifies the other - completed the defense sector 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520
 3 pedro shows earth 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.159
 or there was a constant reduction 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.380
 do you have twitter 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.830
 the end of this year be made 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.610
 the cpv policy decision also preserves the acre

 victory I may have had as an enemy 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.589
 allow an exit with the only man he can escape

 that we can run away and it will be better he ran away than you were after him 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.760

 is more related to the lesser grace 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.010
 due to insolvency proceedings
