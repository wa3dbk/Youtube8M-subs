hey guys careful you're gonna be going
over<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.920> something<00:00:17.279> really<00:00:17.430> exciting<00:00:17.910> I

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
over the something really exciting I

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.070 
over the something really exciting I
think<00:00:18.270> at<00:00:18.630> least<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.439> brand<00:00:20.130> new<00:00:21.080> competition

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
think at least the brand new competition

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.759 
think at least the brand new competition
works<00:00:22.289> exhaust<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> Hypermotard<00:00:23.730> 821

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
works exhaust for the Hypermotard 821

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:25.910 
works exhaust for the Hypermotard 821
okay

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
okay

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
okay
so<00:00:26.160> competition<00:00:26.820> works<00:00:27.119> they're<00:00:27.539> based<00:00:27.750> out

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
so competition works they're based out

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
so competition works they're based out

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
they need to do is the exhaust team has

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.480 
they need to do is the exhaust team has
it<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:41.850> four<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> five<00:01:42.420> days<00:01:43.490> they

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it for the first four to five days they

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
it for the first four to five days they
have<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> take<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> measurements<00:01:45.479> they

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
have to take all the measurements they

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
have to take all the measurements they
have<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.799> figure<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.479> different

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
have to figure out all the different

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
have to figure out all the different
mounting<00:01:49.229> points<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
mounting points and then they take it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.819 
mounting points and then they take it
from<00:01:51.000> there

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
from there

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
from there
then<00:01:52.829> after<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.640> next<00:01:53.670> week<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.299> more

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
then after that the next week is more

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.929 
then after that the next week is more
like<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> finishing<00:01:55.200> stage<00:01:55.670> everything<00:01:56.670> is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
like a finishing stage everything is

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
like a finishing stage everything is
laser<00:01:57.149> cut<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.570> everything<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.409> hand<00:01:58.680> welded

laser cut and everything is hand welded

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
laser cut and everything is hand welded
these<00:01:59.579> exhausts<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:01.520> just<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.540> they're

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
these exhausts are just I think they're

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
these exhausts are just I think they're
phenomenal<00:02:04.350> quality<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.159> being<00:02:05.340> hand

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
phenomenal quality and for being hand

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.710 
phenomenal quality and for being hand
welded<00:02:06.119> they're<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.140> immaculate<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.160> love<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
welded they're just immaculate I love it

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410 
welded they're just immaculate I love it
okay<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:12.000> they

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
okay so just because that they
