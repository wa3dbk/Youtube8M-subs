00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
there's no better button setup and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.090 
there's no better button setup and
steering<00:04:54.720> setup<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.229> steering<00:04:55.500> position<00:04:55.979> in

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
steering setup and steering position in

steering setup and steering position in
a<00:04:56.430> car<00:04:56.639> in<00:04:56.789> this<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.240> category<00:04:57.720> so

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
a car in this kind of category so

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.900 
a car in this kind of category so
overall<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.530> think<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.860> was<00:04:58.979> really<00:04:59.250> nice<00:04:59.520> where

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
overall I think it was really nice where

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.580 
overall I think it was really nice where
are<00:05:00.000> we<00:05:00.090> gonna<00:05:00.180> score<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.539> four<00:05:01.289> and<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.410> quarter

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
are we gonna score it four and a quarter

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.170 
are we gonna score it four and a quarter
I<00:05:01.889> think<00:05:02.039> it's<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.400> good<00:05:02.550> score<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.970> think

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
I think it's a good score and I think

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.060 
I think it's a good score and I think
it's<00:05:03.270> right<00:05:03.389> on<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.600> button<00:05:06.979> drivability<00:05:07.979> our

it's right on the button drivability our

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.890 
it's right on the button drivability our
