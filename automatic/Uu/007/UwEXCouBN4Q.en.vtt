00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.929 
this size which actually has quite a
smaller<00:01:33.720> engine<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.700> looking

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
smaller engine so when you're looking

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.090 
smaller engine so when you're looking
for<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> saw<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.380> good<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.649> pruning

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
for a saw it's you know good for pruning

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.069 
for a saw it's you know good for pruning
kind<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> air<00:01:38.939> cuts<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.899> day

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
kind of up in the air cuts in all day

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
kind of up in the air cuts in all day
and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.409> still<00:01:40.740> bucking<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.250> logs<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.820> stuff

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and then still bucking up logs and stuff

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600 
and then still bucking up logs and stuff
I<00:01:42.299> thought<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.890> handled<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I thought this really handled and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
I thought this really handled and
performed<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.420> well<00:01:45.479> okay<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.259> how<00:01:46.500> many

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
performed very well okay so how many

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649 
performed very well okay so how many
trees<00:01:46.829> should<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> cut<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> one

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
trees should you cut down just that one

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.480 
trees should you cut down just that one
okay<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.979> did<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.219> more

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
okay and then we did a little more

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.060 
okay and then we did a little more
firewood<00:01:50.939> off<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> side<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.009> kind<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
firewood off the side just to kind of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.289 
firewood off the side just to kind of
burn<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> chain<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.909> bit<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.149> see

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
burn up the chain a little bit and see

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.030 
burn up the chain a little bit and see
how<00:01:54.329> long<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> last<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.530> okay

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
how long it was going to last and okay

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.740 
how long it was going to last and okay
so<00:01:56.100> being<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.490> wood<00:01:56.670> burning<00:01:56.880> man<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> guy

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so being a wood burning man and the guy

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.149 
so being a wood burning man and the guy
that<00:01:57.930> has<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.200> create<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> fuel<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that has to create the fuel for that

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.950 
that has to create the fuel for that
sort<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> passion<00:01:59.909> you've<00:02:00.390> used<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> lot<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
sort of passion you've used a lot of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
sort of passion you've used a lot of
chainsaws<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.619> yes<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.130> okay<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.520> how

chainsaws right yes I have okay so how
does<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> perform<00:02:03.390> against<00:02:03.840> others<00:02:04.320> you've

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
does this perform against others you've

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.529 
does this perform against others you've
used<00:02:04.740> um<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.969> I've<00:02:06.090> used<00:02:06.119> everything

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
used um you know I've used everything

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.499 
used um you know I've used everything
from<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.990> high<00:02:07.110> end<00:02:07.520> chainsaws<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.759> press<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
from a high end chainsaws of press you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.180 
from a high end chainsaws of press you
know<00:02:09.690> professional<00:02:10.259> cuttings<00:02:10.680> and<00:02:10.890> stuff<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
know professional cuttings and stuff and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400 
know professional cuttings and stuff and
I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.820> for<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> homeowner<00:02:12.720> ended<00:02:13.110> unit

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I think this for a homeowner ended unit

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.559 
I think this for a homeowner ended unit
if<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.860> right<00:02:14.040> there<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> mid<00:02:14.550> drain<00:02:14.850> so

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
if it's right there in the mid drain so

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.880 
if it's right there in the mid drain so
it's<00:02:15.719> going<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> give<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> lot<00:02:16.859> of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
it's going to give you a lot of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.190 
it's going to give you a lot of
versatility<00:02:17.609> between<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.689> know<00:02:18.810> some<00:02:19.019> pretty

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
versatility between you know some pretty

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.309 
versatility between you know some pretty
decent<00:02:19.469> lumber<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.459> pruning<00:02:21.109> for<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.200> guy

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
decent lumber and pruning for the guy

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.809 
decent lumber and pruning for the guy
that's<00:02:22.590> basically<00:02:23.189> cutting<00:02:23.489> wood<00:02:23.670> for

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
that's basically cutting wood for

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.819 
that's basically cutting wood for

ergonomically<00:03:03.659> it<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.139> it's<00:03:04.469> balanced<00:03:04.889> pretty

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
ergonomically it is it's balanced pretty

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.550 
ergonomically it is it's balanced pretty
well<00:03:05.370> yeah<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.480> know<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:07.230> not<00:03:07.379> going<00:03:07.500> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
well yeah so you know I'm not going to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.020 
well yeah so you know I'm not going to
make<00:03:07.709> one-handed<00:03:08.250> cuts<00:03:08.459> with<00:03:08.639> it<00:03:08.760> today<00:03:08.969> but

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
make one-handed cuts with it today but

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.420 
make one-handed cuts with it today but
do<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.290> know<00:03:10.349> what<00:03:10.439> about<00:03:10.530> one-handed<00:03:11.010> starts

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
do you know what about one-handed starts

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.629 
do you know what about one-handed starts
well<00:03:12.409> for<00:03:13.409> safety<00:03:13.769> reasons<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.310> really

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
well for safety reasons you really

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.939 
well for safety reasons you really
should<00:03:14.909> put<00:03:15.599> your<00:03:15.689> foot<00:03:15.989> embrace<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.769> right

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
should put your foot embrace it right

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.170 
should put your foot embrace it right
here<00:03:17.189> and<00:03:17.370> you'll<00:03:17.459> start<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.969> ground

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
here and you'll start it on the ground

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.140 
here and you'll start it on the ground
in<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.419> secure<00:03:18.719> location<00:03:19.319> absolutely<00:03:19.889> but<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
in a secure location absolutely but you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.280 
in a secure location absolutely but you
know<00:03:21.269> how<00:03:21.419> it<00:03:21.569> is<00:03:21.599> when<00:03:21.840> you're<00:03:21.930> out<00:03:22.079> there

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
know how it is when you're out there

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.199 
know how it is when you're out there
just<00:03:22.650> starts<00:03:23.129> a<00:03:23.220> pretty<00:03:23.430> easily<00:03:23.729> on<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.090> one

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
just starts a pretty easily on the one

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.420 
just starts a pretty easily on the one
hand<00:03:24.359> mover<00:03:24.689> to<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.199> right<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:25.949> says<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.340> has

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
hand mover to it right so it says it has

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.069 
hand mover to it right so it says it has
electronic<00:03:26.970> ignition<00:03:27.209> take<00:03:27.629> me<00:03:27.750> through<00:03:27.930> that

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
electronic ignition take me through that

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.569 
electronic ignition take me through that
because<00:03:28.229> they<00:03:28.409> talked<00:03:28.590> about<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.310> know<00:03:29.370> being

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
because they talked about you know being

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.740 
because they talked about you know being
able<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:29.759> start<00:03:30.030> up<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.209> all<00:03:30.359> sorts<00:03:30.389> of

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
able to start up in all sorts of

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.749 
able to start up in all sorts of
different<00:03:30.900> conditions<00:03:31.919> yeah<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.310> electronic

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:32.759 
different conditions yeah the electronic

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.119 
different conditions yeah the electronic
ignition<00:03:32.970> when<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.780> pull<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.169> throttle<00:03:34.859> it

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
ignition when you pull the throttle it

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.860 
ignition when you pull the throttle it
actually<00:03:35.459> creates<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.389> current<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
actually creates a current for the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.479 
actually creates a current for the
magneto<00:03:37.229> so<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.590> they<00:03:37.949> call<00:03:38.159> it<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> soft

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
magneto so it's they call it a soft

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.890 
magneto so it's they call it a soft
start<00:03:38.759> on<00:03:38.939> this<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.419> certainly<00:03:39.629> feels

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
start on this one and it certainly feels

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.379 
start on this one and it certainly feels
soft<00:03:40.229> when<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.829> pull<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.239> you're

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
soft when you pull it you know you're

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.789 
soft when you pull it you know you're
not<00:03:42.479> you<00:03:42.720> don't<00:03:42.900> have<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.109> jerk<00:03:43.349> your<00:03:43.530> arm<00:03:43.739> out

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
not you don't have to jerk your arm out

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.379 
not you don't have to jerk your arm out
trying<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.159> do<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.579> tells<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.180> right<00:03:45.209> in

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
trying to do it it tells you right in

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.580 
trying to do it it tells you right in
the<00:03:45.419> directions<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.019> know<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.139> couple<00:03:46.379> nice

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
the directions you know a couple nice

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.740 
the directions you know a couple nice
easy<00:03:46.829> pulls<00:03:47.159> it<00:03:47.669> started<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.359> second

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
easy pulls it started on the second

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.170 
easy pulls it started on the second
third<00:03:48.959> Pole<00:03:49.459> consistently<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.639> once<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:51.060> was

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
third Pole consistently and once it was

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.789 
third Pole consistently and once it was
warmed<00:03:51.509> up<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.139> starts<00:03:52.409> every<00:03:52.620> time

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
warmed up you know it starts every time

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.800 
warmed up you know it starts every time
yeah<00:03:53.159> any<00:03:53.340> sort<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.729> vibration<00:03:54.090> control<00:03:54.389> on

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
yeah any sort of a vibration control on

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.979 
yeah any sort of a vibration control on
it

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
it

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.050 
it
it<00:03:55.349> does<00:03:55.530> have<00:03:55.739> some<00:03:55.829> anti<00:03:56.280> vibration<00:03:56.519> control

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it does have some anti vibration control

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.879 
it does have some anti vibration control
so<00:03:57.509> you<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.629> see<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.049> pretty<00:03:58.199> flexible<00:03:58.530> on

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
so you can see it's pretty flexible on

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.469 
so you can see it's pretty flexible on
the<00:03:58.919> chassis<00:03:59.459> and<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.689> you<00:04:01.560> know<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.799> certainly

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
the chassis and so you know it certainly

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.399 
the chassis and so you know it certainly
it<00:04:03.479> did<00:04:03.629> take<00:04:03.840> somebody<00:04:04.169> out<00:04:04.199> of<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
it did take somebody out of the

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.469 
it did take somebody out of the
vibration<00:04:04.949> out<00:04:05.009> of<00:04:05.189> it<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.370> know<00:04:05.489> it's<00:04:06.329> got<00:04:06.449> a

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
vibration out of it you know it's got a

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.369 
vibration out of it you know it's got a
nice<00:04:07.099> positive<00:04:08.099> bar<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.629> you<00:04:09.659> actually<00:04:10.169> bear

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
nice positive bar so you actually bear

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.379 
nice positive bar so you actually bear
that<00:04:10.560> right<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.919> -<00:04:11.099> yeah<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.969> wood<00:04:12.150> get<00:04:12.359> a

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
that right in - yeah the wood get a

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.909 
that right in - yeah the wood get a
little<00:04:12.599> more<00:04:12.689> leverage<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:13.229> your<00:04:13.409> cut<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:13.859> you

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
little more leverage on your cut so you

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.830 
little more leverage on your cut so you
can<00:04:14.039> really<00:04:14.159> hog<00:04:14.489> on<00:04:14.609> that<00:04:14.759> chain<00:04:15.030> mm-hmm<00:04:15.750> oh

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
can really hog on that chain mm-hmm oh

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.959 
can really hog on that chain mm-hmm oh
it<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:16.289> fairly<00:04:16.500> quiet<00:04:16.799> -<00:04:17.130> compared<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.729> other

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:17.969 
it is fairly quiet - compared to other

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.930 
it is fairly quiet - compared to other
chainsaws<00:04:18.509> it's<00:04:18.930> noticeably<00:04:19.590> quieter<00:04:20.370> good

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
chainsaws it's noticeably quieter good

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.979 
chainsaws it's noticeably quieter good
to<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.150> all<00:04:21.329> right<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:21.539> let's<00:04:21.690> get<00:04:21.810> down<00:04:21.930> to

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
to know all right so let's get down to

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.330 
to know all right so let's get down to
the<00:04:22.139> quality<00:04:22.530> what<00:04:22.650> do<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.800> think<00:04:22.979> about<00:04:23.070> it

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the quality what do you think about it

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.890 
the quality what do you think about it
you<00:04:23.789> know<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:24.029> the<00:04:24.090> homeowner<00:04:24.419> once<00:04:24.659> again

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
you know for the homeowner once again

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.930 
you know for the homeowner once again
not<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> lumberjack<00:04:25.979> out<00:04:26.219> there<00:04:26.430> fell<00:04:26.760> on<00:04:26.849> the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
not the lumberjack out there fell on the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.219 
not the lumberjack out there fell on the
big<00:04:27.090> trees<00:04:27.330> do<00:04:27.719> you<00:04:27.779> think<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.020> going<00:04:28.169> to

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
big trees do you think it's going to

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.060 
big trees do you think it's going to
hold<00:04:28.320> up

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
hold up

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.010

pretty good quality there's you know

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.250 
pretty good quality there's you know
some<00:04:32.850> cast<00:04:33.180> aluminum<00:04:33.660> parts<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.990> lot<00:04:34.140> of

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
some cast aluminum parts a lot of

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.530 
some cast aluminum parts a lot of
plastic<00:04:34.740> with<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.550> anti<00:04:35.880> vibration<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.420> mean

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
plastic with the anti vibration I mean

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.600 
plastic with the anti vibration I mean
it<00:04:36.690> feels<00:04:37.050> flexible<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.220> does<00:04:38.340> give<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.580> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
it feels flexible so it does give you a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.150 
it feels flexible so it does give you a
little<00:04:38.850> concern<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:40.620> know<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:40.830> you're<00:04:40.950> hard

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
on it you drop it a few times there is a

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.060 
on it you drop it a few times there is a
chance<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.200> you<00:04:43.380> may<00:04:43.500> break<00:04:43.710> some<00:04:43.920> of<00:04:43.950> the

chance that you may break some of the
plastic<00:04:44.430> Hardware<00:04:44.820> on<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.660> that's<00:04:45.840> a

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
plastic Hardware on it so that's a

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.810 
plastic Hardware on it so that's a
little<00:04:46.110> concern<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:46.770> well<00:04:47.370> I'd<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.790> know

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
little concern but well I'd you know

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.270 
little concern but well I'd you know
good<00:04:48.330> motor<00:04:48.630> it's<00:04:49.110> definitely<00:04:49.920> you<00:04:50.190> know

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
good motor it's definitely you know

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.790 
good motor it's definitely you know
around<00:04:50.670> what<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.210> fifty<00:04:51.510> some<00:04:51.960> CCS<00:04:52.560> which

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
around what is it fifty some CCS which

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.620 
around what is it fifty some CCS which
you<00:04:52.920> want<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.100> seize<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.150> I'm<00:04:54.300> used<00:04:54.510> to

you want to seize and I'm used to

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.870 
you want to seize and I'm used to
something<00:04:54.990> that's<00:04:55.110> around<00:04:55.320> 30<00:04:55.680> CC's<00:04:56.220> with<00:04:56.730> the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
something that's around 30 CC's with the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.750 
something that's around 30 CC's with the
same<00:04:57.090> amount<00:04:57.390> of<00:04:57.450> weight<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:58.190> good<00:04:59.190> quality

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
same amount of weight so good quality

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.670 
same amount of weight so good quality
some<00:05:00.360> good<00:05:01.080> sound<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.410> it

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
some good sound to it

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.710 
some good sound to it
good<00:05:01.890> sound<00:05:02.130> yeah<00:05:02.790> I<00:05:03.030> think<00:05:03.150> it's<00:05:03.420> very<00:05:03.600> well

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
good sound yeah I think it's very well

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.600 
good sound yeah I think it's very well
designed<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.890> think<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.280> it's<00:05:05.400> going<00:05:05.520> to

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
designed and I think that it's going to

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.220 
designed and I think that it's going to
stand<00:05:05.790> up<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.270> know<00:05:06.390> for<00:05:06.600> your<00:05:07.080> average

is a really great value for this tool

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.630 
is a really great value for this tool
it's<00:05:33.480> in<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.630> great<00:05:33.810> price<00:05:34.140> range<00:05:34.640> you're

it's in a great price range you're
getting<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:35.940> kind<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.210> an<00:05:36.270> upgraded<00:05:36.600> motor<00:05:36.930> an

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
getting a kind of an upgraded motor an

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.990

saw I think that I've used other saws in
that<00:05:44.070> same<00:05:44.250> price<00:05:44.490> range<00:05:44.730> that<00:05:45.300> didn't<00:05:45.600> have

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
that same price range that didn't have

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.480 
that same price range that didn't have
the<00:05:45.900> performance<00:05:46.470> didn't<00:05:46.800> have<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
the performance didn't have the the

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.970 
the performance didn't have the the
comfortable<00:05:48.120> feel<00:05:48.390> that<00:05:49.110> were<00:05:49.410> loud
