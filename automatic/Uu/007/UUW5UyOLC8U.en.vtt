make<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> recess<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.890> idea<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:46.219> this

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
make a recess and the idea is that this

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
make a recess and the idea is that this
Minister<00:00:48.090> feeling<00:00:48.360> experimental<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
Minister feeling experimental but the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.110 
Minister feeling experimental but the
idea<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.160> didn't<00:00:50.610> pour<00:00:50.850> molten

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
idea is that I didn't pour molten

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.869 
idea is that I didn't pour molten
aluminium<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.649> goes<00:00:53.160> into<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
aluminium in here it goes into the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.260 
aluminium in here it goes into the
recess<00:00:54.620> comes<00:00:55.620> across<00:00:55.860> forms<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> backing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
recess comes across forms a backing

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
recess comes across forms a backing
plate<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.289> should<00:00:58.590> spit<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.520> this

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
plate and it should spit out in this

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
plate and it should spit out in this
case<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.270> number<00:01:00.570> seventeen

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
case the number seventeen

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
case the number seventeen
I<00:01:01.350> expect<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> whole<00:01:02.430> thing<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> catch<00:01:02.879> fry

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I expect the whole thing to catch fry

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
I expect the whole thing to catch fry
but<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.480> won't<00:01:03.660> matter<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> throwaway

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but they won't matter it's a throwaway

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
but they won't matter it's a throwaway
and<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.549> aluminium<00:01:08.729> should<00:01:09.210> hard

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and the the the aluminium should hard

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
and the the the aluminium should hard
and<00:01:09.990> pretty<00:01:10.650> quickly<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:12.439> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.560> okay<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and pretty quickly and you know okay the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.710 
and pretty quickly and you know okay the
whole<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.640> probably<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
whole thing is gonna probably go out and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.320 
whole thing is gonna probably go out and
be<00:01:15.810> smoked<00:01:16.110> gunnery<00:01:16.470> aware<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> think

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
be smoked gunnery aware but I think

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
be smoked gunnery aware but I think
it'll<00:01:18.810> cool<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.170> quick<00:01:19.530> enough<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.799> I'll

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
it'll cool down quick enough that I'll

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
it'll cool down quick enough that I'll
be<00:01:20.189> able<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.970> fairly<00:01:21.360> good<00:01:24.080> result

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
be able to get out a fairly good result

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
be able to get out a fairly good result
and<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:26.189> course<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.299> matter<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and of course then it's just a matter of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.620 
and of course then it's just a matter of
cleans<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> you've<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.390> house<00:01:30.390> number

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
cleans up and you've got a house number

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.140 
cleans up and you've got a house number
for<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> little<00:01:32.009> plate<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.090> your

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
for your a little plate for your

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.620 
for your a little plate for your
letterbox<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.869> work<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:35.400> show<00:01:36.329> your<00:01:36.509> house

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.010 
letterbox to work to show your house
number<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.040> purely<00:01:38.250> experimental

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
number so this is purely experimental

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
number so this is purely experimental
I'll<00:01:40.020> follow<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> coffee<00:01:42.570> tin

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I'll follow up the the coffee tin

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.880 
I'll follow up the the coffee tin

melts<00:01:47.310> Miller<00:01:47.549> did<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> small<00:01:48.360> man<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> our

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.160 
melts Miller did just a small man of our
millennium<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.450> I'll<00:01:51.450> pour<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.079> see

millennium and I'll pour it in and see

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.240 
millennium and I'll pour it in and see
what<00:01:52.320> happens<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> should<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.100> pretty

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
what happens it should be pretty

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.590 
what happens it should be pretty
interesting<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.850> I'll<00:01:56.909> just

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
interesting so for this one I'll just

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
interesting so for this one I'll just
melt<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.170> some<00:01:58.380> scrap<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
melt down some scrap and this is just

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.959 
melt down some scrap and this is just
some<00:01:59.729> junk<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.360> part<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> an<00:02:01.500> old<00:02:01.969> Jewish

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
some junk this was part of an old Jewish

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.920 
some junk this was part of an old Jewish
outlet<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.600> Suge<00:02:05.270> ahead<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.600> total

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
outlet with Suge ahead which was total

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.499 
outlet with Suge ahead which was total
crap<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:08.099> probably

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
crap so that's probably

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.820 
crap so that's probably
planty<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.430> here's<00:02:12.790> some<00:02:13.470> round<00:02:14.470> stock<00:02:14.709> I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
planty and here's some round stock I

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.180 
planty and here's some round stock I
made<00:02:15.099> which<00:02:16.379> was<00:02:17.379> all<00:02:17.530> porous<00:02:17.980> from<00:02:18.099> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
made which was all porous from the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.600 
made which was all porous from the
middle<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:19.599> ends<00:02:19.900> okay<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.920> ends<00:02:21.099> no<00:02:21.340> good

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
middle that ends okay that ends no good

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.820 
middle that ends okay that ends no good
will<00:02:22.390> melt<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.750> down<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.319> reckon<00:02:23.560> between

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
will melt that down so I reckon between

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.649 
will melt that down so I reckon between
those<00:02:24.069> two<00:02:24.370> probably<00:02:24.879> don't<00:02:25.060> need<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
those two probably don't need that but I

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.630 
those two probably don't need that but I
think<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.930> should<00:02:26.140> be<00:02:26.200> enough<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.769> well<00:02:27.099> I'll

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
think that should be enough to well I'll

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.100 
think that should be enough to well I'll
do<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:27.910> whole<00:02:28.090> lot<00:02:28.360> there's<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> bit<00:02:29.049> of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
do the whole lot there's a bit of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.110 
do the whole lot there's a bit of
scratching<00:02:29.530> from<00:02:29.739> there<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.580> am<00:02:30.730> L<00:02:30.849> all<00:02:31.000> that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
scratching from there so am L all that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.020 
scratching from there so am L all that
down<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.780> should<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:31.989> plenty<00:02:32.200> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
down and there should be plenty of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.949 
down and there should be plenty of
something<00:02:34.030> more<00:02:34.180> than<00:02:34.360> enough<00:02:34.540> there<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.840> do

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
something more than enough there to do

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.039 
something more than enough there to do
the<00:02:35.080> job<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:36.910> always<00:02:37.030> machine<00:02:37.750> back

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
the job and we can always machine back

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.979 
the job and we can always machine back
and<00:02:38.560> what<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:38.890> don't<00:02:39.010> want<00:02:39.310> with<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> fly<00:02:39.670> cutter

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
should flow uniformly and now it's just

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.770 
should flow uniformly and now it's just
a<00:03:16.560> matter<00:03:16.710> of<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.970> aluminium<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.510> pour

it<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.110> see<00:03:19.320> what<00:03:19.470> happens

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.320 

well<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.280> guess<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.669> wasn't<00:04:28.850> such<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.120> great

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
well I guess that wasn't such a great

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:56.939 
well I guess that wasn't such a great
idea

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:04.170 

well<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.759> didn't<00:04:58.030> go<00:04:58.060> quite<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.780> play<00:05:02.699> mmm<00:05:03.759> it

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
well that didn't go quite to play mmm it

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.619 
well that didn't go quite to play mmm it
looks<00:05:04.360> like<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.949> combust<00:05:06.370> ability<00:05:06.939> of<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
looks like the combust ability of the

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.640 
looks like the combust ability of the
wood<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:08.669> well<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.050> fact<00:05:11.259> that<00:05:11.499> because

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
wood is well it's a fact that because

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.739 
wood is well it's a fact that because
it's<00:05:12.009> just<00:05:12.219> keeping<00:05:12.400> them<00:05:12.639> not<00:05:13.180> melamine<00:05:13.599> him
