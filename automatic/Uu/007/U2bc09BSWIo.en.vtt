it's<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> small<00:01:23.400> version<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.940> map<00:01:24.120> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's like a small version of the map it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's like a small version of the map it
helps<00:01:24.510> you<00:01:24.630> find<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:25.080> in-game<00:01:25.350> currency

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.850 
very important to game as well you can
see<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.690> green<00:01:40.020> leader<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.710> off

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
see my little green leader is going off

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.070 
see my little green leader is going off
that<00:01:41.160> means<00:01:41.370> there<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.360> case<00:01:42.690> full<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
that means there is a case full of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.050 
that means there is a case full of
diamonds<00:01:43.350> around<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.980> somewhere<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.970> what

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
diamonds around here somewhere so what

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.270 
diamonds around here somewhere so what
do<00:01:45.120> you<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> pull<00:01:45.600> off<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.840> map<00:01:46.050> by<00:01:46.620> pushing<00:01:46.860> 5

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
do you you pull off the map by pushing 5

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
do you you pull off the map by pushing 5
on<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> computer<00:01:48.210> version<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> whenever

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
on the computer version and whenever

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.950 
on the computer version and whenever
that<00:01:49.890> light<00:01:50.130> lights<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.760> bright<00:01:51.450> green<00:01:51.660> like

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that light lights a bright green like

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
that light lights a bright green like
that<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.290> stays<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:53.040> means<00:01:53.430> you're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that and stays on that means you're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
that and stays on that means you're
looking<00:01:54.000> directly<00:01:54.180> towards<00:01:55.080> where<00:01:55.260> diamond

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
looking directly towards where diamond

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
looking directly towards where diamond
cases<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.970> have<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.360> around<00:01:57.450> where

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
cases so you have to look around where

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
cases so you have to look around where
it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.320> allows<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> buy

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it is and this allows you to buy
