a root for it which is pretty cool all

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.000 
a root for it which is pretty cool all
the<00:03:15.990> other<00:03:16.110> ones<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.380> I've<00:03:16.470> tried<00:03:16.710> to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the other ones that I've tried to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.580 
the other ones that I've tried to
forever<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.850> set<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.210> this<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.140> lot

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
forever just to set up this one is a lot

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.860 
forever just to set up this one is a lot
easier<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:21.270> think<00:03:21.450> its<00:03:21.540> infrastructure

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
easier and I think its infrastructure

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.690 
easier and I think its infrastructure
mode<00:03:22.350> too<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.990> an<00:03:25.110> AP<00:03:25.470> well<00:03:26.190> you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
mode too so it's that an AP well you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.730 
mode too so it's that an AP well you
know<00:03:26.790> it's<00:03:27.390> not<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> other<00:03:28.170> stuff<00:03:28.560> we

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
know it's not like the other stuff we

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.300 
know it's not like the other stuff we
Ord<00:03:29.160> say<00:03:29.370> uh<00:03:29.480> what<00:03:30.480> do<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.570> call<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:31.040> or<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
Ord say uh what do you call it or it's a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.640 
Ord say uh what do you call it or it's a
UH<00:03:34.010> what<00:03:35.010> do<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.100> call<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.700> it's<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.940> UH

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
UH what do you call it or it's a UH

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.460 
UH what do you call it or it's a UH
ad-hoc<00:03:37.650> mode<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.490> it<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.480> think<00:03:40.200> it's<00:03:40.290> actually

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
ad-hoc mode is it I think it's actually

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.880 
ad-hoc mode is it I think it's actually
infrastructure<00:03:41.370> mode<00:03:41.520> which<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.820> pretty<00:03:42.239> sick

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
infrastructure mode which is pretty sick

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.610 
infrastructure mode which is pretty sick
so<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:45.360> let's<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:45.720> turn<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.959> off<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.440> it's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
so so let's just turn this off and it's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.930 
so so let's just turn this off and it's
easy<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.920> turn<00:03:47.040> off<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.430> turn<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.670> off<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
easy to turn off just turn it off and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.690 
easy to turn off just turn it off and
it's<00:03:48.150> completely<00:03:48.600> off<00:03:48.930> now<00:03:49.280> my<00:03:50.280> computer<00:03:50.670> just

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
it's completely off now my computer just

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.640 
it's completely off now my computer just
stopped<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.930> network<00:03:52.050> in<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.470> kit

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
stopped on the in network in this kit

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.699 
stopped on the in network in this kit
and<00:03:52.830> it's<00:03:53.400> going<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.730> my<00:03:53.910> other<00:03:54.060> one<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:55.470> only

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
and it's going to my other one but only

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.010 
and it's going to my other one but only
part<00:03:55.950> about<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.550> I<00:03:56.580> don't<00:03:56.850> like<00:03:57.150> is

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
part about this that I don't like is

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.400 
part about this that I don't like is
that<00:03:58.080> since<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.709> did<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.160> I<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.870> think<00:04:01.290> until

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
that since you did that I I think until

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.890 
that since you did that I I think until
you<00:04:01.800> enable<00:04:02.190> your<00:04:03.000> wireless<00:04:03.270> setting<00:04:03.750> and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
you enable your wireless setting and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.440 
you enable your wireless setting and
type<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.470> know<00:04:04.560> turn<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.340> turn<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.420> back

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
type you know turn on and turn it back

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.240 
type you know turn on and turn it back
off<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.930> think<00:04:07.800> it's<00:04:07.890> still<00:04:08.010> going<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> be

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
off I think it's still going to be

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.120 
off I think it's still going to be
completely<00:04:08.700> on<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.239> like<00:04:09.950> sending<00:04:10.950> out<00:04:11.010> the

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
completely on you like sending out the

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.050 
completely on you like sending out the
actual<00:04:11.340> signal<00:04:13.250> because<00:04:14.250> they<00:04:14.519> all<00:04:14.670> do<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.000> I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
actual signal because they all do that I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.789 
actual signal because they all do that I
don't<00:04:15.180> know<00:04:15.360> why<00:04:15.510> alike<00:04:15.840> they<00:04:15.959> don't<00:04:16.140> turn<00:04:16.620> off

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
don't know why alike they don't turn off

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.330 
don't know why alike they don't turn off
for<00:04:17.010> some<00:04:17.100> reason<00:04:17.370> or<00:04:17.489> something<00:04:17.989> shirts<00:04:18.989> off

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
for some reason or something shirts off

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.730 
for some reason or something shirts off
that's<00:04:20.340> not<00:04:20.519> off<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:21.030> still<00:04:21.299> there<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:22.470> it

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
that's not off but still there but it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.620 
that's not off but still there but it
