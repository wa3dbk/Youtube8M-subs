00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.700
 Please let me begin 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.700
 Today is that 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 I think this London Olympics was a new challenge for me too 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 In that very sense 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.280
 There is also a result but to the voice that has taken this process 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.490
 And to satisfied are you with 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.770
 I think I could have got a new feeling of swimming in a different way as well 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.300
 Finally 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.670
 I think that it is a great big day in the sense that you get medals with this team power 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.940
 You 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.940
 Oh dear 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.060
 You are here base 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.829
 Yosuke it best is supported by the other players 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.400
 Is amazing was taken medal 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 Was After completion with a smile is I think that was good Well for the future 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.859
 Well now slowly 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.410
 I think that I should think about the future slowly 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:02.120
 Yes 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:06.500
 Even if I can leave such a result in the first Olympics, I am still a high school student myself 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:11.720
 I do not know that there is something that is yet to come, but at that time my goal at that time 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.490
 With a lot of effort towards that, that destination is really the Olympics 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.400
 It would be nice if I could have my own satisfying results on the stage of the Olympic Games four years later 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.400
 I think the Fu 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 Hmm 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.420
 Still go on as a still, but we are satisfied color and cut 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.620
 Because there is a color 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.150
 I will do my best again in the future, and for medley relays 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.390
 I hope to receive America someday 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:46.390
 We would like to raise an additional lantern force 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 It's kind of like a sudden barrage, but I'm really happy. 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 Oh dear 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.760
 I still 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.480
 Aim for the future in to say that there is a color of the medal 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.100
 For use after four years again 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.100
 I thought I wanted to work hard
