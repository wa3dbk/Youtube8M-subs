this<00:01:41.150> yeah<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.869> smart<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.470> Lorenzo

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
this yeah that was so smart but Lorenzo

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.490 
this yeah that was so smart but Lorenzo
realized<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.180> his<00:01:45.300> only<00:01:45.479> chance<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> jam

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
realized that his only chance was to jam

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.960 
realized that his only chance was to jam
back<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> inside<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.550> soon<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.880> he

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
back the inside of as soon as he

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.400 
back the inside of as soon as he
possibly<00:01:48.150> could<00:01:48.510> he<00:01:48.630> could<00:01:48.780> let<00:01:48.930> him<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.170> away

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
possibly could he could let him get away

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.859 
possibly could he could let him get away
I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.130> clear<00:01:50.400> lap<00:01:50.610> Marcos<00:01:51.150> 93<00:01:51.660> would

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I think one clear lap Marcos 93 would

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.020 
I think one clear lap Marcos 93 would
have<00:01:52.050> got<00:01:52.440> away<00:01:52.470> from<00:01:52.920> him<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.130> how<00:01:53.340> cool<00:01:53.790> was

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
have got away from him but how cool was

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
have got away from him but how cool was
that<00:01:54.090> we're<00:01:55.080> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.440> about<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> last

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that we're going to think about the last

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
that we're going to think about the last
