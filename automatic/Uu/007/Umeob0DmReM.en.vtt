monkey's<00:00:16.490> uncle<00:00:16.540> now<00:00:17.540> we<00:00:17.660> use<00:00:17.810> that<00:00:18.020> as<00:00:18.170> an

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
monkey's uncle now we use that as an

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.050 
monkey's uncle now we use that as an
expression<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:18.830> surprise<00:00:19.009> but<00:00:19.670> there's<00:00:19.880> some

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
expression of surprise but there's some

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.720 
expression of surprise but there's some
marmoset<00:00:20.570> monkeys<00:00:21.080> who<00:00:21.980> would<00:00:22.100> be<00:00:22.250> surprised

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
marmoset monkeys who would be surprised

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.540 
marmoset monkeys who would be surprised
to<00:00:23.000> learn<00:00:23.029> that<00:00:23.600> they<00:00:24.199> are<00:00:24.380> an<00:00:24.470> uncle<00:00:24.949> to<00:00:25.400> their

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
to learn that they are an uncle to their

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.090 
to learn that they are an uncle to their
own<00:00:25.670> offspring<00:00:26.650> so<00:00:27.650> we're<00:00:27.800> talking<00:00:27.890> about

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
own offspring so we're talking about

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.679 
own offspring so we're talking about
those<00:00:28.369> cute<00:00:28.760> little<00:00:29.000> monkey<00:00:29.269> school

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
those cute little monkey school

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.350 
those cute little monkey school
marmosets<00:00:30.170> mama<00:00:31.099> sets<00:00:31.400> almost<00:00:31.789> always<00:00:32.119> give

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
marmosets mama sets almost always give

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.869 
marmosets mama sets almost always give
birth<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:32.870> fraternal<00:00:33.379> twins<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.340> it's<00:00:34.730> been

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
birth to fraternal twins and it's been

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.990 
birth to fraternal twins and it's been
known<00:00:35.030> since<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.530> 1960s<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:37.130> these<00:00:37.309> twins

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
known since the 1960s that these twins

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.420 
known since the 1960s that these twins
are<00:00:38.420> patchworks<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.440> their<00:00:39.590> own<00:00:39.739> cells<00:00:40.070> their

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
are patchworks of their own cells their

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.900 
are patchworks of their own cells their
Chi<00:00:40.640> mirrors<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:42.829> occurs<00:00:43.100> because<00:00:43.399> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
Chi mirrors and this occurs because the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.200 
Chi mirrors and this occurs because the
the<00:00:44.870> center<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.620> twins<00:00:45.890> fuse<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.059> there's

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
the center of the twins fuse so there's

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.740 
the center of the twins fuse so there's
a<00:00:47.300> channel<00:00:47.770> passageway<00:00:48.770> by<00:00:49.340> which<00:00:49.610> cells<00:00:50.180> one

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
a channel passageway by which cells one

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.190 
a channel passageway by which cells one
twin<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:51.710> migrate<00:00:51.980> into<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.969> other<00:00:53.090> twin<00:00:53.360> yes

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
twin can migrate into the other twin yes

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.709 
twin can migrate into the other twin yes
so<00:00:54.410> these<00:00:54.559> are<00:00:54.920> marmosets<00:00:55.699> are<00:00:55.879> emit<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.390> bit

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
so these are marmosets are emit a bit

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.350 
so these are marmosets are emit a bit
like<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.350> mythical<00:00:57.829> chimera<00:00:58.370> which<00:00:58.579> was<00:00:58.789> part

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
like the mythical chimera which was part

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.290 
like the mythical chimera which was part
goat<00:00:59.600> part<00:01:00.289> serpent<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:00.890> part<00:01:01.160> lion<00:01:01.460> now

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
goat part serpent and part lion now

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.180 
goat part serpent and part lion now
recently<00:01:02.510> at<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.989> University<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.469> Nebraska

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
recently at the University of Nebraska

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.639 
recently at the University of Nebraska
they<00:01:04.670> used<00:01:04.850> DNA<00:01:05.149> testing<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.780> take<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.080> look<00:01:06.440> at

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
they used DNA testing to take a look at

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.440 
they used DNA testing to take a look at
these<00:01:06.860> chimeras<00:01:07.520> that's<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.030> same<00:01:08.210> sort<00:01:08.390> of

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
these chimeras that's the same sort of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.539 
these chimeras that's the same sort of
testing<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:08.960> we<00:01:09.140> use<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.740> test<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.130> human

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
testing that we use to test in human

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.179 
testing that we use to test in human
criminal<00:01:10.939> cases<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.869> what<00:01:12.439> they<00:01:12.590> found<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:13.070> if

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
criminal cases and what they found is if

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.190 
criminal cases and what they found is if
that<00:01:13.549> if<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.729> look<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:14.030> different<00:01:14.390> cells<00:01:14.720> from

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
that if you look at different cells from

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.330 
that if you look at different cells from
one<00:01:15.500> marmosets<00:01:16.340> body<00:01:17.439> some<00:01:18.439> of<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.650> DNA<00:01:19.100> is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
one marmosets body some of the DNA is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.120 
one marmosets body some of the DNA is
its<00:01:20.180> own<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.600> some<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.170> like<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:21.650> sibling

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
its own and some is like it's sibling

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.429 
its own and some is like it's sibling
that<00:01:22.549> was<00:01:22.729> in<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.000> womb<00:01:23.150> with<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.659> now<00:01:24.290> they

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
that was in the womb with it now they

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.530 
that was in the womb with it now they
went<00:01:24.590> even<00:01:24.799> further<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.460> they<00:01:26.090> looked<00:01:26.360> at

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
went even further and they looked at

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.810 
went even further and they looked at
sperm<00:01:26.869> cells<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.590> lo<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.070> behold<00:01:28.189> they<00:01:28.580> found

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
sperm cells and lo and behold they found

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.910 
sperm cells and lo and behold they found
that<00:01:28.909> about<00:01:29.180> half<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.659> them<00:01:29.780> Armas<00:01:30.110> its<00:01:30.259> sperm

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
that about half of them Armas its sperm

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.850 
that about half of them Armas its sperm
cells<00:01:31.189> might<00:01:31.460> have<00:01:31.729> its<00:01:32.299> own<00:01:32.570> genetic<00:01:33.350> imprint

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
cells might have its own genetic imprint

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.700 
cells might have its own genetic imprint
and<00:01:34.040> half<00:01:34.310> might<00:01:34.610> say<00:01:34.939> be<00:01:35.210> sperm<00:01:35.810> from<00:01:36.170> really

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
and half might say be sperm from really

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.219 
and half might say be sperm from really
from<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> brother<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:38.720> guess<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.079> rest

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
from the brother and you guess the rest

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.429 
from the brother and you guess the rest

of the meetings looking at the DNA in

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.109 
of the meetings looking at the DNA in
the<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.619> fathers<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.369> mothers<00:01:47.000> and

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
the in the fathers and the mothers and

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.679 
the in the fathers and the mothers and
the<00:01:47.210> DNA<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.009> offspring<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.909> they

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
the DNA in the in the offspring and they

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.990 
the DNA in the in the offspring and they
found<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.259> DNA<00:01:51.530> fingerprints<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.520> uncle

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
found the DNA fingerprints of the uncle

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.539 
found the DNA fingerprints of the uncle
as<00:01:53.270> well<00:01:53.600> as<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.990> as<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.560> marmoset<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.399> was

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
as well as the as the marmoset that was

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.690 
as well as the as the marmoset that was
the<00:01:55.670> father<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.320> offspring

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
the father of the the of the offspring

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.609 
the father of the the of the offspring
and<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.090> was<00:01:59.810> on<00:01:59.930> an<00:02:00.079> exponent

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
and this is was on an exponent

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.190 
and this is was on an exponent
unexpected<00:02:01.610> form<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.329> genetic<00:02:02.990> or

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
unexpected form of the genetic or

hereditary kaymer ISM and most

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.139 
hereditary kaymer ISM and most
interesting<00:02:06.979> Lee<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.729> seemed<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.090> be

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
interesting Lee this seemed to be

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.479 
interesting Lee this seemed to be
reflected<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.049> behaviors<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.280> mom

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
reflected in the behaviors of the mom

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.510 
reflected in the behaviors of the mom
sex<00:02:10.820> yeah<00:02:11.750> these<00:02:11.930> marmoset<00:02:12.680> seem<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.220> know

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
sex yeah these marmoset seem to know

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.430 
sex yeah these marmoset seem to know
what's<00:02:13.730> going<00:02:13.819> on<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:14.750> my

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
what's going on because my

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.620 
what's going on because my
that's<00:02:15.680> records<00:02:16.220> recognized<00:02:16.880> their<00:02:17.180> young<00:02:17.390> by

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
that's records recognized their young by

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.690 
that's records recognized their young by
smell<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.380> like<00:02:18.530> many<00:02:18.800> mammals<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.430> this

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
smell this is like many mammals do this

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.060 
smell this is like many mammals do this
and<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.690> fact<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:22.030> chimeras<00:02:23.030> would<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:24.070> some

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
and in fact the chimeras would have some

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.280 
and in fact the chimeras would have some
odor<00:02:25.670> producing<00:02:26.180> glands<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.660> would<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.990> from

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
odor producing glands that would be from

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.950 
odor producing glands that would be from
the<00:02:28.130> father<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.760> some<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.390> would<00:02:29.480> be<00:02:29.690> from

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
the father and some that would be from

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.650 
the father and some that would be from
the<00:02:30.110> uncle<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.800> what<00:02:31.580> they<00:02:31.760> found<00:02:32.030> was<00:02:32.600> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the uncle and what they found was that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.560 
the uncle and what they found was that
the<00:02:32.930> fathers<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.470> these<00:02:33.830> chimeric<00:02:34.610> marmosets

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
the fathers of these chimeric marmosets

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.020 
the fathers of these chimeric marmosets
spend<00:02:36.500> more<00:02:36.710> time<00:02:36.950> picking<00:02:37.400> them<00:02:37.640> up<00:02:37.670> and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
spend more time picking them up and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.330 
spend more time picking them up and
carrying<00:02:38.420> them<00:02:38.570> around<00:02:38.800> than<00:02:39.800> they<00:02:39.980> do<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
carrying them around than they do of the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.570 
carrying them around than they do of the
non<00:02:40.670> chimeric<00:02:41.330> ones<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.590> here's<00:02:42.770> his<00:02:43.250> bit<00:02:43.460> of

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
non chimeric ones so here's his bit of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.250 
non chimeric ones so here's his bit of
sort<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.790> sociobiology<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:45.620> seems<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
sort of sociobiology it seems that the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.560 
sort of sociobiology it seems that the
genetic<00:02:48.260> chimeras<00:02:48.950> are<00:02:49.130> being<00:02:49.820> perceived<00:02:50.240> by

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
genetic chimeras are being perceived by

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.290 
genetic chimeras are being perceived by
their<00:02:50.900> fathers<00:02:51.440> as<00:02:51.620> being<00:02:52.400> more<00:02:52.640> similar<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
their fathers as being more similar to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.330 
their fathers as being more similar to
the<00:02:53.420> father's<00:02:53.930> than<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.470> non<00:02:54.680> chimeric

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
the father's than the non chimeric

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.400 
the father's than the non chimeric
between<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.750> father<00:02:56.930> wrecking

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
between and so the father wrecking

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.010 
between and so the father wrecking
thinks<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.160> chimeric<00:02:58.940> queen<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.480> more

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
thinks that this chimeric queen is more

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.680 
thinks that this chimeric queen is more
related<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.130> cares<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:02.060> for<00:03:02.330> it

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
related to it and so cares more for it

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.870 
related to it and so cares more for it
it<00:03:03.200> sort<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.470> represents<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.250> deeper

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
it sort of represents a deeper

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.990 
it sort of represents a deeper
representation<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.960> its<00:03:06.140> kin<00:03:06.470> now<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:07.850> not

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
representation of its kin now it's not

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.790 
representation of its kin now it's not
the<00:03:08.060> same<00:03:08.360> case<00:03:08.600> with<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:09.050> mothers<00:03:09.410> because

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the same case with the mothers because

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.830 
the same case with the mothers because
the<00:03:09.980> mothers<00:03:10.310> handle<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.940> chimeric<00:03:11.420> babies

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
the mothers handle the chimeric babies

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.780 
the mothers handle the chimeric babies
less<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.710> don't<00:03:13.010> know<00:03:13.100> what<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.370> think<00:03:13.610> that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
less so I don't know what you think that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670 
less so I don't know what you think that
means<00:03:14.000> all<00:03:14.360> sufficient<00:03:14.870> we<00:03:15.200> shouldn't<00:03:15.470> pursue

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
means all sufficient we shouldn't pursue

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.760 
means all sufficient we shouldn't pursue
that<00:03:15.980> what<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.190> do<00:03:16.370> think
