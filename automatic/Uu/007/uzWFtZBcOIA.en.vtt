00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
solution to the crisis in Yemen well I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.600 
solution to the crisis in Yemen well I
don't<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.170> eventually<00:00:32.040> Russia

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
don't think so because eventually Russia

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.729 
don't think so because eventually Russia
did<00:00:33.030> abstain<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.719> did<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.020> veto<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
did abstain and did not veto the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.110 
did abstain and did not veto the
resolution<00:00:35.370> which<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.760> could<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.090> done

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
resolution which they could have done

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
resolution which they could have done
easily<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.020> throughout<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
easily and throughout all of the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.369 
easily and throughout all of the
negotiations<00:00:39.300> which<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.930> been<00:00:40.140> following

there<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.700> bit<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.969> conversion<00:00:51.449> on

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
there was a little bit of conversion on

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.330 
there was a little bit of conversion on
certain<00:00:51.930> things<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.350> obviously<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> end

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
certain things but obviously at the end

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.680 
certain things but obviously at the end
of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> day<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.879> managed<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
of the day we managed to get the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.500 
of the day we managed to get the
resolution<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.800> 14<00:00:56.219> votes<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
resolution with 14 votes for it so I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.709 
resolution with 14 votes for it so I
wouldn't<00:00:58.350> say<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:59.370> know<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.359> were<00:01:00.510> many

the end we did manage to get it through

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
the end we did manage to get it through
and<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.000> said<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> Russians<00:01:36.479> did<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.020> veto

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and as I said the Russians did not veto

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.410 
and as I said the Russians did not veto
so<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:37.890> okay<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> normally<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.080 
so that was okay and normally in
negotiations<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.590> of

negotiations there's a lot of
discussions<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.500> has<00:01:43.680> happened<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
discussions and so what has happened is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.999 
discussions and so what has happened is
very<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.790> however<00:01:45.829> concerning<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

neighbouring countries of Yemen which is
a<00:04:32.100> little<00:04:32.340> bit<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.730> what<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:33.120> could<00:04:33.419> call

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
a little bit of what we could call

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.260 
a little bit of what we could call
threat<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.410> these<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.949> these<00:04:34.980> countries<00:04:35.340> so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
threat to these to these countries so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.770 
threat to these to these countries so
the<00:04:36.540> collision<00:04:36.930> has<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.530> plan<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.850> certain

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the collision has a plan of certain

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.260 
the collision has a plan of certain
weapons<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.100> armaments<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:41.910> need<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.210> be

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
weapons and armaments that need to be

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.500 
weapons and armaments that need to be
destroyed<00:04:42.750> for<00:04:43.080> them<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.380> be<00:04:43.500> able<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:44.180> say<00:04:45.180> now

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
destroyed for them to be able to say now

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.270 
destroyed for them to be able to say now
this<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.960> enough<00:04:46.260> we<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.710> go<00:04:46.800> back<00:04:46.979> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
this is enough we have to go back to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.129 
this is enough we have to go back to
square<00:04:47.760> one<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.510> is<00:04:48.750> what<00:04:48.960> we<00:04:49.110> are

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
square one so that is what we are

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.770 
square one so that is what we are
waiting<00:04:49.380> for<00:04:49.699> and<00:04:50.699> one<00:04:50.850> another<00:04:51.330> thing<00:04:51.600> we're

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
waiting for and one another thing we're

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.080 
waiting for and one another thing we're
hoping<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:53.100> hoodies<00:04:53.460> would<00:04:53.669> realize

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
hoping that the hoodies would realize

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.730 
hoping that the hoodies would realize
that<00:04:54.389> what<00:04:54.600> they're<00:04:54.780> doing<00:04:54.810> will<00:04:55.229> not<00:04:55.380> bring

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
that what they're doing will not bring

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.200 
that what they're doing will not bring
them<00:04:55.919> anywhere<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.910> only<00:04:56.970> solution

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
them anywhere and that the only solution

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.960 
them anywhere and that the only solution
is<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.810> go<00:04:58.080> back<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.530> discuss<00:04:59.190> what<00:04:59.400> they<00:04:59.550> did

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
is to go back and discuss what they did

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.000 
is to go back and discuss what they did
what<00:05:00.450> they<00:05:00.479> have<00:05:00.930> been<00:05:01.200> wanting<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.770> discuss
