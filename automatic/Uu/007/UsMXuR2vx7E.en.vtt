 balloons means and that's it 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.580
 just because when I'm 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.620
 went on the app so drop on 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.480

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.750
 I caught so I will not 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.940
 plus throw it directly 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.870
 I do not cheat with my credits etc 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.489
 it's just that I've had decades of 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.470
 daily on the application was not this 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.110
