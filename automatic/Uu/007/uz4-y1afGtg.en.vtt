you off the road

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.440 
you off the road
plays<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.130> cop<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:36.940> have<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.210> do<00:01:37.300> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
plays the cop and you have to do the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.030 
plays the cop and you have to do the
opposite<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.080> slam<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.470> bad<00:01:38.619> guy<00:01:38.830> off<00:01:39.010> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
opposite you slam the bad guy off the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.880 
opposite you slam the bad guy off the
road<00:01:39.310> too<00:01:39.880> bad<00:01:40.030> that's<00:01:40.180> way<00:01:40.930> easier<00:01:41.440> said<00:01:41.740> than

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
road too bad that's way easier said than

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.260

done

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.360 

so<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.330> first<00:01:47.570> problem<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.950> driving

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
so the first problem is that the driving

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.830 
so the first problem is that the driving
in<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:49.550> game<00:01:49.760> is<00:01:49.880> awful<00:01:50.210> no<00:01:50.480> matter<00:01:50.660> which

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
in this game is awful no matter which

in this game is awful no matter which
side<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.140> pick<00:01:51.410> you're<00:01:51.860> gonna<00:01:51.950> be<00:01:52.100> slower

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
side you pick you're gonna be slower

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.100 
side you pick you're gonna be slower
than<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.760> other<00:01:52.880> guy<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.360> ridiculous<00:01:53.870> you

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
than the other guy it's ridiculous you

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.260 
than the other guy it's ridiculous you
try<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.500> outrun<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.980> cop<00:01:55.190> keep<00:01:55.700> on<00:01:55.820> Scindia

try to outrun the cop keep on Scindia

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.090 
try to outrun the cop keep on Scindia
like<00:01:56.450> every<00:01:56.720> five<00:01:56.990> seconds<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.650> can't<00:01:57.860> shake

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
like every five seconds you can't shake

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.040 
like every five seconds you can't shake
them<00:01:58.280> not<00:01:58.790> only<00:01:58.820> because<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.660> know<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.810> cars

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
them not only because you know the cars

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.200 
them not only because you know the cars
are<00:02:00.260> just<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.010> slow<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.940> driving

mechanics<00:02:02.479> suck<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.710> also<00:02:03.830> because<00:02:04.190> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
mechanics suck but also because the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.500 
mechanics suck but also because the
roads<00:02:04.550> are<00:02:04.729> narrow<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.240> you're<00:02:05.390> obviously

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
roads are narrow so you're obviously

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.900

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.270 
so then he switched to air land and sea

anyway the rescue missions all have

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.380 
anyway the rescue missions all have

have the helicopter ambulance even

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.059 
have the helicopter ambulance even
though<00:03:35.450> they<00:03:35.599> feel<00:03:36.079> pretty<00:03:36.380> much<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.860> same

there's<00:03:37.670> at<00:03:37.819> least<00:03:37.849> an<00:03:38.269> aesthetic<00:03:38.810> difference

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
there's at least an aesthetic difference

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.050 
there's at least an aesthetic difference
in<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.739> bone<00:03:39.890> levels<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.519> probably<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.940> most

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
in the bone levels are probably the most

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.250 
in the bone levels are probably the most
fun<00:03:41.329> you'll<00:03:41.480> have<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.780> entire<00:03:41.900> game

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
fun you'll have in the entire game

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.710 
fun you'll have in the entire game
actually<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.400> navigate<00:03:43.549> these<00:03:43.970> maze

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
actually you have to navigate these maze

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.350 
actually you have to navigate these maze
like<00:03:44.989> waterways<00:03:45.650> locating<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.670> targets<00:03:47.150> that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
like waterways locating the targets that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960 
like waterways locating the targets that
part<00:03:47.959> actually<00:03:48.230> doesn't<00:03:48.890> suck<00:03:49.160> but<00:03:49.549> all<00:03:49.790> the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
part actually doesn't suck but all the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.809 
part actually doesn't suck but all the
other<00:03:50.150> vehicles<00:03:50.510> suck<00:03:51.110> for<00:03:51.980> some<00:03:52.160> reason<00:03:52.430> the

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
other vehicles suck for some reason the

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.030 
other vehicles suck for some reason the
helicopters<00:03:53.720> can't<00:03:54.110> fly<00:03:54.319> over<00:03:54.590> buildings

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
helicopters can't fly over buildings

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.979 
helicopters can't fly over buildings
that's<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.090> kind<00:03:56.269> of<00:03:56.299> quality<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.780> can

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that's the kind of quality you can

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.870 
that's the kind of quality you can
expect<00:03:57.319> here

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.850 

yeah<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.450> don't<00:04:01.810> know<00:04:02.050> if<00:04:02.170> these<00:04:02.290> games<00:04:02.620> were

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
yeah I don't know if these games were

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.070 
yeah I don't know if these games were
released<00:04:02.980> individually<00:04:03.550> and<00:04:04.270> this<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.600> like<00:04:04.780> a

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
released individually and this is like a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.500 
released individually and this is like a
compilation<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.340> two<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:07.240> it<00:04:07.360> is

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
compilation of the two but if it is

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.990 
compilation of the two but if it is
that'd<00:04:08.200> be<00:04:08.380> ridiculous<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:09.340> know<00:04:09.370> they<00:04:09.910> don't

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
that'd be ridiculous you know they don't

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.460 
that'd be ridiculous you know they don't
even<00:04:10.210> have<00:04:10.330> enough<00:04:10.450> gameplay<00:04:10.960> combined

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
even have enough gameplay combined

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.280 
even have enough gameplay combined
buying<00:04:12.220> them<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.520> their<00:04:12.670> own

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
buying them on their own

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.630 
buying them on their own
you'd<00:04:14.290> be<00:04:14.440> better<00:04:14.590> off<00:04:14.740> throwing<00:04:15.160> your<00:04:15.460> money

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
you'd be better off throwing your money

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.030 
you'd be better off throwing your money
into<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:15.970> fire<00:04:16.270> this<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.870> an<00:04:17.020> ugly<00:04:17.260> sounding

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
into a fire this is an ugly sounding

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.000 
into a fire this is an ugly sounding
