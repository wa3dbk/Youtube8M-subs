seven around the edge and then two in
the<00:01:46.200> middle<00:01:47.090> pop<00:01:48.090> them<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.200> need<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
do is to get two fingers make a hole in

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
do is to get two fingers make a hole in
your<00:01:52.740> compost<00:01:53.159> close<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> edge<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.450> put

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
your compost close to the edge and put

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
your compost close to the edge and put
the<00:01:54.750> root<00:01:54.930> ball<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.490> okay<00:01:56.490> we're<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.909> doing

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the root ball in okay we're not doing

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.630 
the root ball in okay we're not doing
any<00:01:57.390> firming<00:01:57.869> down<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.619> literally<00:01:59.009> just

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
any firming down we're literally just

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160 
any firming down we're literally just
letting<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> plant<00:02:00.240> settle<00:02:00.719> down<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
letting the plant settle down into the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.280 
letting the plant settle down into the
compost<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.460> two<00:02:02.670> fingers<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.689> then<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.079> go

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
compost so two fingers and then they go

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.499 
compost so two fingers and then they go
I've<00:02:05.009> already<00:02:05.310> taken<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.909> flowers<00:02:06.360> off

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
I've already taken the other flowers off

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
I've already taken the other flowers off
this<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:07.229> there's<00:02:07.469> any<00:02:07.619> buds

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
this if there's any buds

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070 
this if there's any buds
you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.610> take<00:02:08.819> those<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:09.509> because

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you can take those off as well because

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.750 
you can take those off as well because
you<00:02:10.170> want<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> plant<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.800> grow<00:02:10.950> rather<00:02:11.520> than

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you want the plant to grow rather than

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.680 
you want the plant to grow rather than
flower

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
flower

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.660 
flower
for<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> moment<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.250> two

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
for the moment so that's just two

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.830 
for the moment so that's just two
fingers<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.200> goes<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.630> work

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
fingers and then it goes so just work

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.630 
fingers and then it goes so just work
round<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.320> edge<00:02:20.930> trying<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.370> space<00:02:23.370> them

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
round the edge trying to space them

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
round the edge trying to space them
evenly<00:02:27.920> okay<00:02:32.360> there<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.480> go

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
evenly okay there we go

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.960 
evenly okay there we go
I've<00:02:34.320> actually<00:02:34.530> only<00:02:34.800> made<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.490> two<00:02:35.640> three

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I've actually only made one two three

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
I've actually only made one two three
four<00:02:36.180> five<00:02:36.390> I've<00:02:36.540> made<00:02:36.750> six<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.770> what<00:02:37.890> I'll<00:02:38.040> do

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
four five I've made six so what I'll do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.670 
four five I've made six so what I'll do
is<00:02:38.250> I'll<00:02:38.490> put<00:02:38.520> three<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.180> middle<00:02:39.300> okay<00:02:40.140> so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
is I'll put three in the middle okay so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680 
is I'll put three in the middle okay so
all<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.800> need<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.070> do<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.060> roughly<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.660> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
all we need to do is just roughly do a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.270 
all we need to do is just roughly do a
triangle<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.560> will<00:02:46.800> fill<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:46.980> pot

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
triangle and that will fill the pot

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520 
triangle and that will fill the pot
nicely<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.210> again<00:02:48.480> it's<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.840> two<00:02:49.050> fingers

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
nicely so again it's just two fingers

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.740 
nicely so again it's just two fingers
and<00:02:50.070> we're<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.340> putting<00:02:50.580> them<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.660> we're

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and we're just putting them in and we're

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.040 
and we're just putting them in and we're
not<00:02:51.870> doing<00:02:52.140> any<00:02:52.350> pushing<00:02:52.800> down<00:02:53.870> we're<00:02:54.870> just

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
not doing any pushing down we're just

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.010 
not doing any pushing down we're just
literally<00:02:55.440> popping<00:02:55.920> them<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> last

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
literally popping them in and the last

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.520 
literally popping them in and the last
one<00:02:58.290> goes<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.960> we've<00:03:01.080> got<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> nice

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
one goes in there so we've got a nice

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.380 
one goes in there so we've got a nice
full<00:03:01.860> basket<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:02.580> there's<00:03:02.730> plenty<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.120> room

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
full basket but there's plenty of room

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.860 
full basket but there's plenty of room
for<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.750> grow<00:03:04.050> all<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.250> need<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
for it to grow all you need to do now is

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.530 
for it to grow all you need to do now is
give<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> good<00:03:07.800> watering<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.540> watering

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
in will help settle the plants settle

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.550 
in will help settle the plants settle
the<00:03:11.550> compost<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.240> encourage<00:03:12.840> those<00:03:13.020> roots<00:03:13.350> to

weight of the compost and the water will

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.800 
weight of the compost and the water will
pull<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.310> hanging<00:03:29.670> basket<00:03:30.090> material<00:03:30.570> down<00:03:30.750> a
