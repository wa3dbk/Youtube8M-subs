over toxic that means that his blissey

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
over toxic that means that his blissey
won't<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.680> able<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.160> star<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:50.969> because<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
won't be able to out star me because I

get<00:00:53.190> fully<00:00:53.489> paralyzed<00:00:54.059> consecutively<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.530> now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
get fully paralyzed consecutively so now

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.810 
get fully paralyzed consecutively so now
i'm<00:00:55.920> gonna<00:00:56.010> switch<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:56.610> app<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
i'm gonna switch out to my app so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
i'm gonna switch out to my app so
because<00:00:57.239> i<00:00:57.300> figured<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> he's<00:00:57.870> gonna<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.170> for

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
because i figured that he's gonna go for

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.010 
because i figured that he's gonna go for
attacking<00:00:58.710> move<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> since<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.300> implied

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
attacking move and since this is implied

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
attacking move and since this is implied
that<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> mega<00:01:01.710> absol<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that it's a mega absol which is kind of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
that it's a mega absol which is kind of
obvious<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.409> go

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
obvious that it would be I'm gonna go

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
obvious that it would be I'm gonna go
for<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> pursuit<00:01:05.070> put<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> game<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> switch<00:01:05.880> off

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
for a pursuit put the game to switch off

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
for a pursuit put the game to switch off
but<00:01:06.210> he<00:01:06.299> does<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> he<00:01:07.439> instead

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
but he does not do that he instead

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310 
but he does not do that he instead
predicts<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.180> super<00:01:09.570> power<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.170> then

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
predicts me to have super power and then

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
predicts me to have super power and then
goes<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> softball<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.640> covered<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
goes for the softball so covered the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
goes for the softball so covered the
damage<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> superpower<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:13.830> potentially

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
damage that superpower would potentially

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
damage that superpower would potentially
inflict<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.299> him<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.350> gonna

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
inflict on to him so now I'm gonna

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.870 
inflict on to him so now I'm gonna
switch<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.770> into<00:01:16.979> dom<00:01:17.220> pan<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:17.580> i<00:01:17.729> don't

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
switch out into dom pan because i don't

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
switch out into dom pan because i don't
want<00:01:17.909> any<00:01:18.240> unnecessary<00:01:18.479> damage<00:01:18.960> inflicted<00:01:19.229> on

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
want any unnecessary damage inflicted on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
want any unnecessary damage inflicted on
to<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:19.770> app<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.670> now

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to my app so because i know that now

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
to my app so because i know that now
since<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.810> didn't<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.350> super<00:01:22.619> power

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
since i didn't go for the super power

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
since i didn't go for the super power
it's<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.670> incentive<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.600> him<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> go

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's just more incentive for him to go

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960

flamethrower<00:03:14.579> i<00:03:14.849> think<00:03:15.389> i<00:03:15.540> also<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:16.019> also<00:03:16.260> get

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
flamethrower i think i also can also get

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.740 
flamethrower i think i also can also get
paid<00:03:16.889> split<00:03:17.220> i<00:03:17.370> might<00:03:17.669> contemplate<00:03:18.090> using

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
paid split i might contemplate using

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.690 
paid split i might contemplate using
paints<00:03:19.139> but<00:03:19.349> i<00:03:19.500> might<00:03:19.769> not<00:03:19.950> already<00:03:20.220> really

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
paints but i might not already really

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.220 
paints but i might not already really
see<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:20.940> point<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.329> using<00:03:21.660> paints<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
see the point on using paints but on a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530 
see the point on using paints but on a
half<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.769> really<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.940> use<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.150> for<00:03:24.209> more

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
half so really can use that for more

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.199 
half so really can use that for more
tanky<00:03:25.169> pokemon<00:03:25.769> like<00:03:25.919> such<00:03:26.220> as<00:03:26.489> roller<00:03:26.910> man

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
tanky pokemon like such as roller man

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.819 
tanky pokemon like such as roller man
wheezing<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.079> think<00:03:28.379> I<00:03:28.410> want<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.680> keep<00:03:28.769> my

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
wheezing I think I want to keep my

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.539 
wheezing I think I want to keep my
regular<00:03:29.220> set<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.910> now<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.239> comes<00:03:30.269> milotic<00:03:31.169> and

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
regular set so now it comes milotic and

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.599 
regular set so now it comes milotic and
wheezing<00:03:32.549> can't<00:03:32.849> do<00:03:33.180> anything<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.650> milotic<00:03:35.370> so

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
wheezing can't do anything to milotic so

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.309 
wheezing can't do anything to milotic so
he's<00:03:35.730> gonna<00:03:35.849> bring<00:03:36.120> back<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.780> his<00:03:36.959> nurse<00:03:37.169> so

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
he's gonna bring back in his nurse so

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.539 
he's gonna bring back in his nurse so
I'm<00:03:37.410> gonna<00:03:37.500> predict<00:03:37.859> that<00:03:37.949> and<00:03:38.099> go<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.519> the

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
I'm gonna predict that and go for the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.710 
I'm gonna predict that and go for the
giant<00:03:39.090> tail<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.889> income<00:03:41.370> Sinha's<00:03:42.060> pidgeot

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
giant tail and in income Sinha's pidgeot

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.509 
giant tail and in income Sinha's pidgeot
so<00:03:43.079> that's<00:03:43.290> great<00:03:43.620> i<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.919> go<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.220> scar

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
so that's great i can go for the scar

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.629 
so that's great i can go for the scar
right<00:03:44.910> here<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.709> get<00:03:46.709> some<00:03:46.769> residual<00:03:47.489> damage

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
right here and get some residual damage

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.210 
right here and get some residual damage
onto<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.569> i<00:03:49.230> guess<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.530> next<00:03:49.769> switching

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
onto this and i guess the next switching

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.339 
onto this and i guess the next switching
would<00:03:50.609> be<00:03:50.879> decisive<00:03:51.690> because<00:03:51.989> he<00:03:52.109> would<00:03:52.230> get

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
would be decisive because he would get

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.750 
would be decisive because he would get
inflicted<00:03:52.680> with<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.919> cell<00:03:53.160> phones<00:03:53.430> but

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
inflicted with the cell phones but

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.159 
inflicted with the cell phones but
that's<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.209> case<00:03:54.389> because<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.810> go<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.079> the

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
that's not the case because to go to the

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.020 
that's not the case because to go to the
default<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.859> afterwards<00:03:56.669> i<00:03:56.730> get<00:03:56.879> fully

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
default and afterwards i get fully

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.339 
default and afterwards i get fully
paralyzed<00:03:57.449> so<00:03:57.599> now<00:03:57.720> i'm<00:03:57.780> gonna<00:03:57.870> predict<00:03:58.230> him

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
paralyzed so now i'm gonna predict him

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.409 
paralyzed so now i'm gonna predict him
to<00:03:58.440> switch<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.889> into<00:03:59.190> something<00:03:59.639> not<00:04:00.000> simply

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
to switch out into something not simply

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.780 
to switch out into something not simply
 like<00:04:00.840> he<00:04:00.959> just<00:04:01.319> does<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.889> term<00:04:02.129> but

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
 like he just does this term but

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.430 
 like he just does this term but
i'm<00:04:03.239> gonna<00:04:03.419> protect<00:04:03.540> him<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.959> switch<00:04:04.139> out<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
i'm gonna protect him to switch out and

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.349 
i'm gonna protect him to switch out and
go<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.650> dragon<00:04:05.010> tail<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.400> I'm<00:04:06.209> gonna

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
go for the dragon tail and I'm gonna

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.599 
go for the dragon tail and I'm gonna
phase<00:04:06.599> them<00:04:06.780> out<00:04:06.900> into<00:04:07.139> his<00:04:07.650> wheezing<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.340> now

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
phase them out into his wheezing so now

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.289 
phase them out into his wheezing so now
instead<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.449> golf<00:04:09.750> or<00:04:09.989> put<00:04:10.230> taubira<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:11.299> dragon

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
instead of golf or put taubira of dragon

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.430 
instead of golf or put taubira of dragon
tears<00:04:12.480> i'm<00:04:12.660> going<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> switch<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.139> up<00:04:13.230> right

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
tears i'm going to switch it up right

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.670 
tears i'm going to switch it up right
now<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.829> go<00:04:14.250> for<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.519> skull<00:04:15.139> just<00:04:16.139> inflict<00:04:16.530> some

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
now and go for a skull just inflict some

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.349 
now and go for a skull just inflict some
more<00:04:16.829> damage<00:04:17.190> onto<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.609> i<00:04:17.700> know<00:04:17.760> that

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
more damage onto it i know that

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.719 
more damage onto it i know that
paints<00:04:18.750> club<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.409> I<00:04:19.469> think<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.919> optimal<00:04:20.489> for

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
paints club and I think it's optimal for

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.679 
paints club and I think it's optimal for
him<00:04:20.879> to<00:04:21.090> want<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.750> stay<00:04:22.079> in<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:23.509> get<00:04:24.509> more

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:24.689 
him to want to stay in and get more

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:26.659 
him to want to stay in and get more
damage<00:04:25.080> inflicted<00:04:25.229> on<00:04:25.560> too<00:04:25.770> since<00:04:26.129> he<00:04:26.460> is

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
damage inflicted on too since he is

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.640 
damage inflicted on too since he is
faster<00:04:27.210> than<00:04:27.240> me<00:04:27.479> since<00:04:27.750> i'm<00:04:27.870> fully<00:04:28.139> paralyzed

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
faster than me since i'm fully paralyzed

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.189 
faster than me since i'm fully paralyzed
he<00:04:29.099> can<00:04:29.310> now<00:04:29.580> use<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.330> time<00:04:30.599> assume<00:04:30.990> that

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
like okay maybe now he's gonna switch

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.070 
like okay maybe now he's gonna switch
out<00:06:31.680> but<00:06:32.520> maybe<00:06:32.760> not<00:06:33.060> okay<00:06:33.510> I'm<00:06:33.630> just<00:06:33.690> gonna<00:06:33.870> go

out but maybe not okay I'm just gonna go
and<00:06:34.290> go<00:06:34.710> for<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.860> earthquake<00:06:35.220> this<00:06:35.340> is<00:06:35.520> my<00:06:35.669> gut

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.640 
and go for the earthquake this is my gut
feeling<00:06:36.360> I<00:06:36.419> he's<00:06:36.540> gonna<00:06:36.690> stay<00:06:36.930> in<00:06:36.960> any<00:06:37.199> ends<00:06:37.560> up

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
feeling I he's gonna stay in any ends up

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.530 
feeling I he's gonna stay in any ends up
staying<00:06:37.889> in<00:06:38.130> that<00:06:38.310> turn<00:06:38.699> so<00:06:39.240> I'm<00:06:39.300> gonna<00:06:39.389> go

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
staying in that turn so I'm gonna go

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.820

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
afterwards on the next turn go for the I

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.570 
afterwards on the next turn go for the I
shot<00:06:48.210> but<00:06:48.720> instead<00:06:49.229> he<00:06:49.590> switches<00:06:49.860> out<00:06:50.130> right

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
turns out to be a physical set and at

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.879 
turns out to be a physical set and at
the<00:07:06.330> same<00:07:06.510> time<00:07:06.570> it<00:07:07.080> was<00:07:07.229> revealed<00:07:07.500> after<00:07:07.680> the

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
the same time it was revealed after the

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.279 
I thought that donphan could live that
that's<00:07:11.430> why<00:07:11.610> I<00:07:11.639> stayed<00:07:12.000> in<00:07:12.150> with<00:07:12.419> it<00:07:12.630> so<00:07:13.260> I
