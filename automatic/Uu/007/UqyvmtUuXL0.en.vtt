frank lloyd wright early in his career

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.690 
frank lloyd wright early in his career
was<00:00:13.110> interested<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.679> squares<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.639> rectangles

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
was interested in squares and rectangles

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.170 
was interested in squares and rectangles
and<00:00:15.480> very<00:00:15.809> simple<00:00:16.170> geometry<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.949> he<00:00:17.369> became

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
and very simple geometry as he became

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.179 
and very simple geometry as he became
more<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:18.720> advanced<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.350> his<00:00:19.470> career<00:00:19.890> he

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
more and more advanced in his career he

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
more and more advanced in his career he
started<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.880> wonder<00:00:21.689> about<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
started to wonder about the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.189 
started to wonder about the
possibilities<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.070> more<00:00:24.029> complex<00:00:24.539> geometry

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
possibilities of more complex geometry

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.259 
possibilities of more complex geometry
and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> spiral<00:00:25.980> geometry<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and the spiral geometry is one of the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.380 
and the spiral geometry is one of the
the<00:00:27.900> forms<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.949> fascinated<00:00:29.580> him<00:00:29.730> late

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the forms that that fascinated him late

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.120 
the forms that that fascinated him late
into<00:00:30.689> life<00:00:30.900> he<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.410> course<00:00:31.650> was<00:00:31.920> also

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
into life he of course was also

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.830 
into life he of course was also
designing<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> guggenheim<00:00:33.180> museum<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
designing the guggenheim museum at the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
designing the guggenheim museum at the
same<00:00:34.079> time<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.620> he<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.890> designing<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.820> house

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
same time as he was designing this house

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.400 
same time as he was designing this house
and<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.770> rather<00:00:38.370> humble<00:00:38.850> house<00:00:39.410> you

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and so in this rather humble house you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
and so in this rather humble house you
can<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.649> Frank<00:00:41.430> Lloyd<00:00:41.550> Wright<00:00:41.760> experimenting

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
can see Frank Lloyd Wright experimenting

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.319 
can see Frank Lloyd Wright experimenting
with<00:00:42.750> ideas<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.440> would<00:00:43.680> ultimately<00:00:44.329> find

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
with ideas that would ultimately find

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.709 
with ideas that would ultimately find
fruition<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.289> some<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> most<00:00:47.100> remarkable

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
fruition in some of the most remarkable

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
fruition in some of the most remarkable
museum<00:00:48.719> architecture<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> its<00:00:49.710> time<00:00:50.420> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
museum architecture of its time this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.590 
museum architecture of its time this
place<00:00:52.039> was<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.160> personal<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.969> write<00:00:54.149> because

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
place was very personal to write because

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.950 
place was very personal to write because
it<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.840> designed<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.289> his<00:00:55.469> son<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> an

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it was designed for his son it was a an

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.479 
it was designed for his son it was a an
example<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> live<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> desert

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
example for how to live in the desert

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.900 
example for how to live in the desert
Southwest<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.750> by<00:01:00.930> having<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.910> curved

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
Southwest you know by having this curved

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.530 
Southwest you know by having this curved
form<00:01:03.390> he's<00:01:04.189> creating<00:01:05.189> space<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
form he's creating space that has a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800 
form he's creating space that has a
sense<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.580> continuous<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
sense that it's continuous it's going on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.260 
sense that it's continuous it's going on
and<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:11.939> always<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and on so you know there's always this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670 
and on so you know there's always this
idea<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.659> discovery<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.320> you're<00:01:13.500> coming

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
idea of discovery as you're coming

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020 
idea of discovery as you're coming
around<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.130> corner

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
around the corner

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
around the corner
so<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.350> big<00:01:16.500> corner<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so this has this one big corner and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
so this has this one big corner and
you're<00:01:17.520> moving<00:01:17.970> through<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> you're

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you're moving through it and you're

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
you're moving through it and you're
always<00:01:18.869> looking<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.799> what's<00:01:20.100> what's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
always looking you know what's what's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.429 
always looking you know what's what's
around<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> next<00:01:21.060> bend<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.140> there's<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
around the next bend so there's this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
around the next bend so there's this
great<00:01:22.710> idea<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.970> exploring<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.810> new<00:01:25.380> discovery

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
great idea of exploring a new discovery

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
great idea of exploring a new discovery
and<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> makes<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> sense<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and it makes a lot of sense here in

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
and it makes a lot of sense here in
Arcadia<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.780> David<00:01:31.470> Wright<00:01:31.650> house

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
Arcadia the the David Wright house

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.020 
Arcadia the the David Wright house
spirals<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.790> views<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
spirals up so that you can have views of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
spirals up so that you can have views of
the<00:01:36.119> surrounding<00:01:36.600> landscape<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.409> also

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the surrounding landscape and also

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.770 
the surrounding landscape and also
spirals<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.700> other<00:01:38.820> reasons<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.420> spirals

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
spirals up for other reasons it spirals

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
spirals up for other reasons it spirals
up<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.440> can<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> vantage<00:01:42.030> point

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
up so that you can get a vantage point

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.930 
up so that you can get a vantage point
above<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.040> orange<00:01:44.040> groves<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:44.850> the

above the orange groves which at the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.149 
above the orange groves which at the
time<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.330> was<00:01:45.450> built<00:01:45.630> were<00:01:46.320> predominant<00:01:47.100> in

time it was built were predominant in
this<00:01:47.310> area<00:01:47.700> once<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> got<00:01:48.570> above<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> orange

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this area once you got above the orange

this area once you got above the orange
groves<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.890> had<00:01:50.070> these<00:01:50.190> phenomenal<00:01:50.940> views

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
