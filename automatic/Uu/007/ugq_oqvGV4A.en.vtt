00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
they're going to be using what's

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.520 
they're going to be using what's
comparable<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> high<00:01:07.799> setting<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.490> pc<00:01:09.000> but

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
comparable to the high setting on pc but

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
comparable to the high setting on pc but
pc<00:01:10.530> has<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> setting<00:01:11.340> above<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> called<00:01:12.240> ultra

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.160 
pc has a setting above that called ultra
and<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.439> why<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> buy<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.030> console<00:01:15.720> for

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and so why would I buy a console for

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.399 
and so why would I buy a console for
five<00:01:16.409> hundred<00:01:16.590> dollars<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:18.140> isn't<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
