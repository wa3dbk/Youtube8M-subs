00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.599
 my ladies and gentlemen the situation in the 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.719
 East Ukraine is back to the 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:10.969
 osze observers in the region report 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.589
 a continuous escalation of 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.340
 fighting between the 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.860
 Ukrainian army and the separatists 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.530
 We are counting more and more focal points 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.110
 vice-boss of osze observers 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.390
 commission in ukraine alexander hug 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.130
 last saturday the 13th 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.609
 june 2015 the osze alerted that the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.179
 Fighting increasingly in inhabited areas 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.879
 be discharged 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.739
 the landmines are used and that 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.699
 heavy weapons back to the front 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.730
 to return 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.499
 this is a dangerous development 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.719
 because in the context of the so-called mint 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.300
 Two deals were the serious ones 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.890
 three months ago finally from the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.140
 withdrawn front lines 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.499
 and right now where ever 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.800
 reasonably stable with two agreements 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.879
 definitely to fail who threatens new 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.299
 peacemaking measures in the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.479
 ukraine more important than ever but the usa 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.060
 Unfortunately, exactly the opposite happens 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.790
 Conflict parties to call secure 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.680
 to end this with two and the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.009
 Finger definitely from heavy weapons too 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.149
 let the us 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.110
 defense ministry now , too 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.670
 to bring heavy weapons into play 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 in concrete terms, washington is planning 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.259
 announcements of the new york times 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 straight both armor and heavy weapons 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.740
 as well as 5000 us-soldiers in the nato 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.200
 from start and thus to the Russian 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.390
 limit 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.939
 one wants the fire in ukraine conflict 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.130
 as well as in the future with gasoline delete 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.969
 but such a step would be the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.049
 important nato russia at the year 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.630
 Dissolve in 1997 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.939
 in these contracts became russia 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.009
 assured that on the permanent 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.869
 deployment of ground troops and 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.590
 weapons in the and nato eastern states 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.899
 renounce values moscow will break 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.289
 this contract is not without resistance 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.729
 can accept and a new one 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.800
 escalation stage of the conflict 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.150
 preprogrammed 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.500
 so much the usa 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.900
 apparently to the compliance of the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.879
 ensure human rights in other countries 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 the protection of the needy 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.379
 civil population in the bramble seems 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.200
 to be indifferent to them at the moment 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.970
 the stationing of heavy weapons 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.280
 the Russian border benefits the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.310
 distressed populations of the east 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.319
 Ukraine certainly not sure 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.049
 cited flieden on the European 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.689
 continent as a whole the peace in 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.930
 Europe can not do it but only 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.269
 Engage with Russia too 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.489
 against the war in which they are ours 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.290
 broadcasts continue to spread 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.290
 thank you and good evening
