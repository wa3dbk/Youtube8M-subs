00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.290 

for<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.080> hardware<00:01:08.380> there's<00:01:09.009> a<00:01:09.159> one<00:01:09.759> inch<00:01:09.970> gate

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
for the hardware there's a one inch gate

to<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.840> sump<00:01:17.110> tank<00:01:17.770> how<00:01:18.369> everyone<00:01:18.819> plumb<00:01:19.149> it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
to the sump tank how everyone plumb it

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.350 
to the sump tank how everyone plumb it
and<00:01:19.810> then<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.800> venturi<00:01:21.399> it's<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.850> life<00:01:22.090> rate

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
and then this venturi it's a life rate

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
and then this venturi it's a life rate

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
bottom of my time which is why I have

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.649 
bottom of my time which is why I have
the<00:01:35.740> wire<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.399> it's<00:01:36.819> all<00:01:37.000> hanging<00:01:37.299> on<00:01:37.539> the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
the wire and it's all hanging on the

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.649 
the wire and it's all hanging on the
front<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:39.310> there's<00:01:39.789> nothing<00:01:40.179> that<00:01:40.209> it's<00:01:40.539> not

this<00:01:40.869> boy<00:01:41.110> it's<00:01:41.410> just<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.649> quarantine<00:01:42.190> tank<00:01:45.539> now

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
this boy it's just a quarantine tank now

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.850 
this boy it's just a quarantine tank now
ideally<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.830> would<00:01:48.610> remove<00:01:49.209> this<00:01:49.629> venturi<00:01:50.500> it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
ideally I would remove this venturi it

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.609 
ideally I would remove this venturi it
screws<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:52.349> and<00:01:53.940> put<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:54.970> massive<00:01:55.479> injury<00:01:56.019> on<00:01:56.379> it

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
screws in and put a massive injury on it

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.509 
screws in and put a massive injury on it
or<00:01:57.550> at<00:01:57.670> least<00:01:57.700> try<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> bigger<00:01:58.420> pump<00:01:58.810> first

00:01:59.509 --> 00:01:59.519 
or at least try a bigger pump first

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:05.609 
or at least try a bigger pump first
because<00:02:02.129> the<00:02:03.129> manzai<00:02:03.640> venturi<00:02:04.179> just<00:02:04.619> blows

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
because the manzai venturi just blows

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.080 
because the manzai venturi just blows
the<00:02:05.890> froth<00:02:06.190> like<00:02:06.489> crazy

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090
