00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.720

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.189
 depressive phase is there to be asks 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.050
 something off me and almost did 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.489
 to give up time because I mean mine 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.320
 life makes itself most fight 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.090
 or do I have to turn my valve and 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.680
 write pages long it is time to 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.969
 I'm not really into the concept 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.890
 No plan how to apply 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.780
 I write for every text space 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.729
 it is time to go because my cv 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.260
 it is immaculate no education no 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.750
 job no bother with me is not so 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.399
 People have to go far behind me 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.960
 left out would have to sort out because they 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.460
 not fit my life properly 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.260
 Farewell is not hard for me 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.909
 easy unbelievable it was already so on time 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.600

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.549

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.619

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.479

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.049
 everything queried but somehow it will be 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.299
 Going on time for me to go says 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.490
 Barnes time for that I had so much to do 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.049
 but unfortunately no time for too much 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.560
 time lost a look in the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.210
 distance 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.659
 and then it will go time is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.789
 written in the brain 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.249
 time for me to say was one 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.869
 time has it and infor unfortunately 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.549
 no time for that too much time 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.319
 lost a look into the distance 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.810
 and then the site becomes those 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:35.079
 written in the archipelago 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.079
 I thought it would be so nm 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.320

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.950
 which hand it is time for me 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.110
 to go because the stress is too much for me 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 It will be time for me to go because I have nothing 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.950
 To be able to cope constantly 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.780
 run but I nothing more to accommodate 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.909

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.030
 you do not fall asleep after on with you 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.679
 although the whole stress would be forgotten 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.390
 If I'm with her after the time for me 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.299
 to go because I have nothing left to say 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.310
