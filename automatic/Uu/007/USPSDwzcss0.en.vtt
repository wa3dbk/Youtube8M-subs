this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.199> Call<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.530> Duty<00:00:01.800> 5<00:00:02.010> player<00:00:02.520> model

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
this is a Call of Duty 5 player model

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.130 
this is a Call of Duty 5 player model
and<00:00:03.689> it's<00:00:04.230> 72<00:00:05.130> inches<00:00:05.790> tall<00:00:06.089> as<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.660> can<00:00:06.839> see

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
and it's 72 inches tall as you can see

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.669 
and it's 72 inches tall as you can see
in<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.980> side<00:00:08.220> panel<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:10.969> that's<00:00:12.679> 168

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
in the side panel here and that's 168

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.120 
in the side panel here and that's 168
centimeters<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.839> correct<00:00:16.830> scale

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
centimeters and it's the correct scale

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.660 
centimeters and it's the correct scale
it's<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.730> real<00:00:18.000> world<00:00:18.300> scale<00:00:19.400> but<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.490> also

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it's it's real world scale but I also

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
it's it's real world scale but I also
imported<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.689> model<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.680> vending

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
imported this model here a vending

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.689 
imported this model here a vending
machine<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.640> too

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
machine and as you see it's it's way too

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.080 
machine and as you see it's it's way too
large<00:00:27.410> because<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.279> exported<00:00:29.910> with<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
large because it was and exported with a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.770 
large because it was and exported with a
proper<00:00:30.390> scale<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:33.090> would<00:00:33.329> import

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
proper scale it's it would import

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.830 
proper scale it's it would import
correctly<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.430> unit<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> 3d

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
correctly if one unit in the 3d

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
correctly if one unit in the 3d
application<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.980> centimeter<00:00:38.550> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
application would be one centimeter but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.270 
application would be one centimeter but
it's<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.180> inch<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:41.300> one<00:00:42.300> inch<00:00:42.540> equals<00:00:43.579> 2.5<00:00:44.690> 4

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
it's one inch and one inch equals 2.5 4

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
it's one inch and one inch equals 2.5 4
centimeters<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.390> need<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> correct<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
centimeters so we need to correct the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.010 
centimeters so we need to correct the
scale<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> keep<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
scale and as we want to keep the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.150 
scale and as we want to keep the
proportions<00:00:52.640> we<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.090> select<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> model<00:00:55.289> hit

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
proportions we just select the model hit

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.549 
proportions we just select the model hit
S<00:00:56.399> key<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.079> scales<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
S key and you see it scales with the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.910 
S key and you see it scales with the
mouse<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.100> now<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> start<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> type<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.190> say

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
mouse but now I start to type and I say

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.750 
mouse but now I start to type and I say
2.54<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.830> entering

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
2.54 and you can also see it entering

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
2.54 and you can also see it entering
the<00:01:08.880> values<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.729> now<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.080> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the values here and now as you see it it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.640 
the values here and now as you see it it
scaled<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.189> even<00:01:14.549> more<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.140> want<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
scaled it even more up but we want it to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.480 
scaled it even more up but we want it to
be<00:01:16.770> smaller<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.549> here's<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> trick<00:01:19.340> just<00:01:20.340> hit

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
be smaller and here's the trick just hit

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.499 
be smaller and here's the trick just hit
the<00:01:20.670> divide<00:01:20.970> key<00:01:21.830> yeah<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.509> change

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the divide key yeah and it will change

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
the divide key yeah and it will change
the<00:01:24.720> value<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> 1<00:01:25.409> divided<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:25.920> 2<00:01:26.159> point<00:01:26.640> 5<00:01:26.909> 4

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the value to 1 divided by 2 point 5 4

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.649 
the value to 1 divided by 2 point 5 4
which<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.610> relation<00:01:29.610> between

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
which is the relation between

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.580 
which is the relation between
centimeters<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.720> inches<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.259> hit<00:01:31.979> enter

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
centimeters and inches and hit enter

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
centimeters and inches and hit enter
this<00:01:34.590> looks<00:01:35.210> way<00:01:36.210> better

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.050 

yeah<00:01:41.300> okay<00:01:43.159> but<00:01:45.320> let's<00:01:46.320> say<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
yeah okay but let's say we know that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.469 
yeah okay but let's say we know that
this<00:01:48.720> model<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.940> actually<00:01:50.940> in<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.780> real<00:01:51.990> world

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
this model is actually in the real world

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.440 
this model is actually in the real world
90<00:01:54.479> inches<00:01:54.990> tall<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:56.310> enter<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
90 inches tall I can enter it here and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.200 
90 inches tall I can enter it here and
we'll<00:01:58.369> scale<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:01.310> just<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.550> hey<00:02:02.700> it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
we'll scale it up but just the hey it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.570 
we'll scale it up but just the hey it's
just<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> height<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.470> not<00:02:04.680> width<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
just the height and is not width and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.060 
just the height and is not width and
depth<00:02:05.910> so<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.900> doesn't<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.920> original

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
depth so it doesn't have the original

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.370 
depth so it doesn't have the original
proportions<00:02:08.759> anymore<00:02:10.280> go<00:02:11.280> back<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:12.330> yeah<00:02:13.260> we

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
proportions anymore go back and yeah we

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.360 
proportions anymore go back and yeah we
need<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.560> find<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.220> better<00:02:14.550> way<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.850> scale<00:02:15.420> it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
need to find a better way to scale it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.710 
need to find a better way to scale it
yeah<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:19.140> will<00:02:19.860> use<00:02:20.330> just<00:02:21.330> some<00:02:21.570> simple

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
yeah and I I will use just some simple

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.949 
yeah and I I will use just some simple
math<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> current<00:02:27.540> scale

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
math this is this is the current scale

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.030 
math this is this is the current scale
and<00:02:30.200> we<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.709> has<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.330> 90<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:34.050> so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and we know it has to be 90 actually so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
and we know it has to be 90 actually so
we<00:02:36.140> type<00:02:37.140> divided<00:02:37.830> by<00:02:38.120> 90<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:41.000> what<00:02:42.000> we<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.330> is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
we type divided by 90 and what we get is

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.410 
we type divided by 90 and what we get is
the<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.630> scale<00:02:46.080> factor<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.239> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the is a scale factor you don't have to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.620 
the is a scale factor you don't have to
care<00:02:48.660> much<00:02:49.410> about<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:50.130> value<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.630> calculate

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
care much about the value you calculate

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.170 
care much about the value you calculate
here<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:53.250> could<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.700> either<00:02:54.330> below<00:02:55.170> 1<00:02:55.470> or<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
here it could be either below 1 or if I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.270 
here it could be either below 1 or if I
revert<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:59.420> you<00:03:00.420> could<00:03:00.570> also<00:03:01.190> write<00:03:03.110> 90

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
revert this you could also write 90

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.840 
revert this you could also write 90
divided<00:03:05.280> by<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.459> current<00:03:06.329> scale<00:03:07.670> which<00:03:08.670> will

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
divided by the current scale which will

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.220 
divided by the current scale which will
give<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.239> value<00:03:09.420> higher<00:03:10.019> than<00:03:10.350> 1<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:12.230> yeah

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
give you a value higher than 1 and yeah

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.759 
give you a value higher than 1 and yeah
you<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.070> take<00:03:14.220> both<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:15.380> will<00:03:16.380> keep

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
you can you can take both I will keep

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.199 
you can you can take both I will keep
the<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.519> point<00:03:17.880> two<00:03:18.600> zero<00:03:18.630> two<00:03:19.610> I'll<00:03:20.610> just

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the one point two zero two I'll just

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.030 
the one point two zero two I'll just
keep<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.750> mind<00:03:21.930> for<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.140> second<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.920> can

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
keep it in mind for a second you can

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.900 
keep it in mind for a second you can
also<00:03:23.190> write<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.579> down<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.850> course<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:25.880> yeah<00:03:26.880> I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
also write it down of course and yeah I

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.140 
also write it down of course and yeah I
would<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.720> reverse<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:30.239> scaling<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
would just reverse the this scaling and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.900 
would just reverse the this scaling and
now<00:03:33.150> with<00:03:33.480> mom<00:03:33.690> selected<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.380> hit<00:03:34.620> s<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:35.670> scale

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
now with mom selected I hit s to scale

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.330 
now with mom selected I hit s to scale
and<00:03:36.680> type<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.890> value<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:39.060> had<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:41.130> in

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
and type the value I just had in the in

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.250 
and type the value I just had in the in
the<00:03:41.459> box<00:03:41.670> for<00:03:42.299> Z

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the box for Z

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.830 
the box for Z
which<00:03:43.860> was<00:03:44.099> one<00:03:44.400> point<00:03:44.790> two<00:03:45.239> zero<00:03:45.269> two<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.840> now

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
which was one point two zero two and now

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.039 
which was one point two zero two and now
it's<00:03:49.080> almost<00:03:49.470> 90<00:03:50.250> inches<00:03:50.610> -<00:03:50.819> all<00:03:50.970> yet<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.900> not

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
it's almost 90 inches - all yet it's not

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.470 
it's almost 90 inches - all yet it's not
exactly<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.739> doesn't<00:03:53.580> care<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.819> much<00:03:54.209> I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
exactly but doesn't care that much I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.820 
exactly but doesn't care that much I
guess<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:56.360> if<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.540> got<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.080> zero<00:03:58.470> point

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
guess and if you got the zero point

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.080 
guess and if you got the zero point
eight<00:03:59.870> something<00:04:00.870> value<00:04:01.730> then<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.760> would

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
eight something value then you would

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.890 
eight something value then you would
almost<00:04:03.629> do<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.080> same<00:04:04.580> scale<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.879> time<00:04:06.480> zero

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
almost do the same scale and time zero

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.360 
almost do the same scale and time zero
point<00:04:07.410> eight

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
point eight

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.240 
point eight
I<00:04:08.400> don't<00:04:08.640> know<00:04:08.760> three<00:04:09.239> two<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.069> hit<00:04:11.069> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
I don't know three two and hit the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.509 
I don't know three two and hit the
divide<00:04:11.700> key<00:04:12.590> -<00:04:13.909> yeah<00:04:14.909> -<00:04:15.650> like<00:04:16.650> invert<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
divide key - yeah - like invert the

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.990 
divide key - yeah - like invert the
value<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:20.130> will<00:04:20.370> give<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.639> same<00:04:20.820> result

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
value and it will give the same result

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.169 
value and it will give the same result
doesn't<00:04:21.479> matter<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.840> much
