00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.370
 the scenario of devastation is what producers of maize from Maracaibo and 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.600
 found in the fields after the rain of the last days the force of the wind was 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.779
 so much that it destroyed entire plantations 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.929
 the gale hit the cornfield in September 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 here on top of the truck had the size of the damage 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.909
 the 250 hectares planted 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.150
 in the morning to do a homonymous job queirÃ³ 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 the opposite in the future 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 the world 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.090
 ralf is an apostle 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.930
 a culture unfortunately to see a scene of this sad the force of the wind was so 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.710
 that feet so cheap 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.110
 like the spike and this small 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.110
 the damage is great the grape very little thing 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.060
 practically nothing 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.550
 it's the loss 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.730
 imminent we have some early games 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.850
 keene may be able to minimize the damage but with certainty 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.270
 the damage was in this other crop some tracks were able to resist the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.090
 gale 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.150
 even so 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.430
 330 corn areas were deposited by the wind 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.890
 from here where are we 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.500
 at end 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.240
 four kilometers of destruction 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.289
 why did a perfume of vat and the wind overturn others 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.670
 at the same time 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.710
 the plant at a certain stage 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 as she calls ana in the green corn phase for example 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.289
 it already creates a larger number of larger adhesives 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.370
 that I tell you 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.270
 is a greater resistance in the plant 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.670
 then this plant which is a younger plant 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.690
 she still did not have the ability to take off 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.620
 so good account that he loves in the field of his alfredo 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 this was the only request that resisted the gale 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.860
 the damage of 240 thousand reais he does not work is tied 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.070
 in this great work and was at the loss 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 then one 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.760
 is irreversible and 6 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.009
 he has no way 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.140
 according to this agronomist the fishermen to be broken 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.220
 still grow, she will try to raise 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 this causes it to spend a greater amount of energy 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.319
 the energy only that it would send the country and the grain preventing the organ from 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.179
 form 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:20.209
 the way this loss should be formed, we will be able to quantify the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.949
 she's going to be here in a few more days 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:22.980
 I can see that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.859
 the amount of plants that can rise 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.089
 but sure that at a time like this 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:30.719
 Africa will pass 50% elano
