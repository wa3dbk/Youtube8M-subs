 from maceiÃ³ 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.300
 the impression I have is that you are 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.070
 with you when you sing you're 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 reading a catalog of offers from 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:40.829

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.180

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.659
 the program gains one more representative 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.450
 of pop music and an excellent 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.640
 representative where you are beautiful, not you 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.640

 I do not feel like keeping my 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.670
 it is rare to see an instrumentalist 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.390
 Sing quality with the same quality 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.390

 not expected but it worked out fine and I 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.730
