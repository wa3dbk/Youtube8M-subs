00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
today all day we use our cause triple

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.200 
today all day we use our cause triple
cross<00:00:06.200> over<00:00:06.560> here<00:00:06.680> so<00:00:06.920> three<00:00:07.370> quick<00:00:07.850> little

cross over here so three quick little

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.579 
cross over here so three quick little
crossover<00:00:08.480> move<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.200> I'm<00:00:09.290> going<00:00:09.469> to<00:00:09.499> start

getting<00:00:10.339> wider<00:00:10.730> if<00:00:11.179> you<00:00:11.299> do<00:00:11.450> a<00:00:11.480> wider<00:00:11.749> cause

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
getting wider if you do a wider cause

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.980 
getting wider if you do a wider cause
one<00:00:12.410> to<00:00:12.860> three<00:00:13.459> so<00:00:13.700> it's<00:00:13.849> three<00:00:14.119> really<00:00:14.570> quick

this as I'm doing it in the drill or as

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.729 
this as I'm doing it in the drill or as
you<00:00:32.119> would<00:00:32.150> do<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.509> if<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.870> remember<00:00:33.620> that

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
you would do it if you remember that

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.260 
you would do it if you remember that
when<00:00:33.890> you<00:00:33.980> get<00:00:34.129> into<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:34.430> game<00:00:34.670> things<00:00:35.030> are<00:00:35.180> not

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
going to happen exactly as they happen

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.189 
going to happen exactly as they happen
in<00:00:36.890> practice<00:00:37.039> is<00:00:37.489> usually<00:00:37.879> in<00:00:38.000> practice<00:00:38.480> maybe

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
in practice is usually in practice maybe

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.080 
in practice is usually in practice maybe
people<00:00:39.649> are<00:00:39.800> letting<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.399> get<00:00:40.520> your<00:00:40.730> move<00:00:40.940> and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
people are letting you get your move and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.700 
people are letting you get your move and
maybe<00:00:41.300> you're<00:00:41.480> working<00:00:41.809> out<00:00:41.899> by<00:00:42.110> yourself<00:00:42.530> so

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
maybe you're working out by yourself so

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.170 
maybe you're working out by yourself so
of<00:00:42.800> course<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.160> got<00:00:43.309> all<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.579> space<00:00:43.820> you<00:00:43.850> want

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
of course you got all the space you want

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.270 
of course you got all the space you want
the<00:00:44.780> game<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.199> might<00:00:45.289> not<00:00:45.469> look<00:00:45.680> like<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.070> so

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
the game it might not look like this so

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.979 
the game it might not look like this so
remember<00:00:46.699> in<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:46.879> game<00:00:47.090> you're<00:00:47.359> going<00:00:47.629> in<00:00:47.780> and

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
remember in the game you're going in and

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.200 
remember in the game you're going in and
playing<00:00:48.620> instinctively<00:00:49.309> what<00:00:49.609> you<00:00:49.760> get<00:00:50.000> to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
playing instinctively what you get to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.270 
playing instinctively what you get to
that<00:00:50.329> level<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:50.780> by<00:00:50.899> practicing<00:00:51.530> enough<00:00:51.800> that

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
that level is by practicing enough that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.830 
that level is by practicing enough that
you<00:00:52.430> can<00:00:52.579> do<00:00:52.789> things<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.420> can<00:00:53.600> react<00:00:53.809> to

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
you can do things you can react to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.599 
you can do things you can react to
whatever<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.379> defense<00:00:54.829> puts<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.250> front<00:00:55.430> of

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
whatever the defense puts in front of

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.099 
whatever the defense puts in front of
you<00:00:55.730> but<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.390> don't<00:00:56.570> have<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.719> worry<00:00:56.989> about

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
you but you don't have to worry about

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.930 
you but you don't have to worry about
doing<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.620> move<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.190> game<00:00:58.429> is<00:00:58.670> not<00:00:58.699> about

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
doing a move and the game is not about

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.880 
doing a move and the game is not about
how<00:00:59.359> many<00:00:59.420> movies<00:00:59.809> can<00:01:00.260> do<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:00.590> don't<00:01:00.739> get

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
how many movies can do you don't get

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.500 
how many movies can do you don't get
points<00:01:01.129> for<00:01:01.309> moves<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:01.789> get<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.969> point<00:01:02.179> to<00:01:02.359> fit

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
points for moves you get a point to fit

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.689 
points for moves you get a point to fit
points<00:01:02.929> and<00:01:03.500> when<00:01:03.590> you<00:01:03.679> get<00:01:03.859> into<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.129> game<00:01:04.369> if

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
points and when you get into a game if

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.160 
points and when you get into a game if
you<00:01:04.850> never<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.360> situation<00:01:05.659> where<00:01:06.110> you

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
you never have a situation where you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.499 
you never have a situation where you
need<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.409> use<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:07.100> triple<00:01:07.820> crossover<00:01:08.299> type

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
need to use this a triple crossover type

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.120 
need to use this a triple crossover type
of<00:01:08.659> move<00:01:08.840> that's<00:01:09.080> fine<00:01:09.259> maybe<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.740> might<00:01:09.890> use

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
of move that's fine maybe you might use

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.399 
of move that's fine maybe you might use
this<00:01:10.250> move<00:01:10.520> one<00:01:10.759> time<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.210> next<00:01:11.420> two<00:01:12.140> years

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
this move one time in the next two years

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.929 
this move one time in the next two years
but<00:01:12.710> if<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:12.950> don't<00:01:13.130> practice<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.759> won't

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
but if you don't practice it you won't

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.520 
but if you don't practice it you won't
have<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.479> won't<00:01:14.689> have<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.960> skills<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.320> do

practice for 10 hours for one hour worth
a<00:01:19.640> game<00:01:19.850> I'm<00:01:20.150> sure<00:01:20.420> if<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.750> really<00:01:21.049> think
