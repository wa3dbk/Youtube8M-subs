00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.110
 good friends 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 on the basis that I have not seen any 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.810
 tutorial 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 how to put the pistons 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.559
 all texts anisakis tones 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.709
 well i want oea has explained 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.709
 how to make a piston jealous 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.119
 in open the resell dyn that adenex ton 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 that's why here health or more 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.920
 this lohan from whom you mainly that is the oil the tipnis 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.329
 indecent and ip 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.699
 of the secondary 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.520
 and of primary with pressure 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.260
 then they have to identify on the piston 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 yes this percent the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.350
 the address where you should go 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.290
 the piston since in one direction all 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.610
 in this case 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.450
 here 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.820
 Kelly does not shrink 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.310
 that tip for her 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.710
 yes then it has wants to the pulleys waved the pump of the sec 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.150
 We start by putting first the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.690
 fresnillo 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.130
 of this one 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.640
 sevilla distribution 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 what is this 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.120
 will be hours 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.500
 takes three million 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 first let's put this 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 we have this one first 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.180
 carefully 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 we put like this 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.400
 these two rings 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 along with milk and oils are those that go to 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 above 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 a care 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.359
 without doubling the pro 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.299
 the second 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.449
 keep an eye out 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.329
 after the first entry here each 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.329
 who will make at least three centimeters 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.069
 pointed distance pointed 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.189
 since if these are about to jump tip 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 this one is not even much stronger 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.429
 we can see the 1 points 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.719
 that we have other points 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 and here it is the hardest of difference napout 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:07.579
 we have three
