a lot of times when I think of powdering

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
I think of a taste somewhat like a pie

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
I think of a taste somewhat like a pie
cherry<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> lemon<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.509> quite<00:01:57.960> like

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that it's it's a little bit more of a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.050 
that it's it's a little bit more of a
kick<00:02:00.360> than<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.079> fact<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> like

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
kick than that in fact it's kind of like

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
kick than that in fact it's kind of like
having<00:02:03.299> Ellen<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.049> mouth<00:02:04.259> jaci<00:02:05.250> savages

now<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.070> popular<00:02:23.820> belief<00:02:23.970> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
now it's a popular belief that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
now it's a popular belief that
persimmons<00:02:25.230> actually<00:02:25.710> need<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> freeze<00:02:26.610> in

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
persimmons actually need a freeze in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
persimmons actually need a freeze in
order<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.600> ahead<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.110> ripen<00:02:28.590> however<00:02:29.160> they

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
order to go ahead and ripen however they

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.070 
order to go ahead and ripen however they
don't<00:02:29.550> really<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> time<00:02:31.050> of

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
don't really it's just that the time of

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.680 
don't really it's just that the time of
year<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.070> get<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.460> freeze<00:02:32.730> coincides

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
year that we get the freeze coincides

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.380 
year that we get the freeze coincides
when<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.500> when<00:02:35.040> they're<00:02:35.280> ripening<00:02:35.820> already

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
when with when they're ripening already

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.240 
when with when they're ripening already
so<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:37.050> don't<00:02:37.230> necessarily<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.160> have

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
so they don't necessarily have to have

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520 
so they don't necessarily have to have
that<00:02:38.280> freeze<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:39.900> we're<00:02:40.050> looking<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.470> now

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
that freeze so what we're looking at now

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.280 
that freeze so what we're looking at now
this<00:02:41.520> persimmon<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.150> starting<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.630> ripen<00:02:42.810> it's
