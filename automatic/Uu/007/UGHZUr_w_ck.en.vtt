00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.570
 i 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.570
 two 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.670
 walk down the street and take pictures with 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.340
 my cell phone is without a doubt something that 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.080
 many entertain me I'm not thinking 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.570
 consciously what I want 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.990
 photograph or post every image that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 taken 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.520
 curiously one of our painters 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.530
 most recognized considers this matter of 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.290
 the immediacy of technology something 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.300
 magical and has also found a link 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.059
 between the photos he takes so 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.790
 obsessive and its colorful and fantastic 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.980
 paintings almost does not come out of his workshop that 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.140
 It is now also your home and according to your 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.260
 own words his utopia of 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.010
 self-sufficiency so better myself 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.010
 I bring him a coffee 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.340
 ah 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.580
 because we would go to a cafe if we can 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.060
 take one here 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.060
 thank you very much 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 I remember seeing and already many 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.690
 months ago on your facebook a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.210
 constant publication these photographs 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.340
 very beautiful ravine that you take with you 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.030
 instagram how did you start doing that and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.540
 ended then in one is an exhibition 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.700
 with photos always always always 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.110
 given with a camera in your pocket or a 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.479
 thing here that happens to me important 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.350
 to talk about the project is that I discover 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.090
 the instagram and great list for its format 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.369
 and for the filters that it has 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.710
 a couple of things that I'm interested in doing 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.160
 with the images of my painting has 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.770
 thought about these formats a lot 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.540
 out they said they are almost square 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.450
 Bulgarians who say they are the most 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.030
 difficult to paint the instagram link is 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.260
 square and filters one of them in 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.020
 the hand 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.000
 overload the light image the flat a 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.540
 little and that brings us to my work there 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.190
 a hitch that gives you a jump is given 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.530
 increases the speed of this project 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.570
 moral I look and record if I have that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.640
 custom and I walk down the street and I notice 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.440
 in everything for me technology or the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.720
 relationship that I have with technology 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.380
 It is full of magic and amazement of mine 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.600
 it's not that technical cold world one has 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.910
 to live the reality of his life 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.620
 everyday matter with that ability to 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.720
 amazement because it is finally what 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.150
 we have true then there is nothing 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.460
 more then in this case the technology 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.440
 would put in and for that as changed not the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.830
 dynamic of showing things through 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.830
 of the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.170
 yesterday with the person who told me 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 who is doing his literature thesis 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.430
 about instagram because you are interested in 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 people are no longer interested in what 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.200
 they say or for what they are but for what they 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.900
 come I do not know if someone calls you the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.840
 attention is what that person has 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.910
 decided to rescue from reality and put 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.710
 as an image it baffled me from 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.420
 wonderful to me and not because you 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.150
 will interest someone because you knew what 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.300
 music listen 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.450
 it's natural and you see that this person sees 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.819
 of reality catches your attention 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.390
 is 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.390
 two
