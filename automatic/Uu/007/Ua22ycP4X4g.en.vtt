have quite a layout back in Midland
Texas<00:01:02.800> what<00:01:03.249> is<00:01:03.339> that<00:01:03.900> well<00:01:04.900> it's<00:01:05.110> where<00:01:06.010> we

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
Texas what is that well it's where we

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.270 
Texas what is that well it's where we
build<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> cars<00:01:06.730> and<00:01:07.650> over<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.770> years<00:01:09.040> we've

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
build the cars and over the years we've

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.550 
build the cars and over the years we've
just<00:01:09.310> gotten<00:01:10.210> bigger<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.510> bigger<00:01:10.780> we<00:01:11.080> we

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
just gotten bigger and bigger we we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.420 
just gotten bigger and bigger we we
started<00:01:11.860> out<00:01:11.979> with<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.130> shop<00:01:12.430> and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
started out with a shop and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.210 
started out with a shop and
now<00:01:13.520> we've<00:01:13.730> got<00:01:13.910> dynamometer<00:01:14.780> tests

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
now we've got dynamometer tests

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.800 
now we've got dynamometer tests
good<00:01:16.340> man

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
good man

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.440 
good man
pretty<00:01:18.649> pretty<00:01:19.189> complete<00:01:19.520> facility<00:01:20.270> for

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
pretty pretty complete facility for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.930 
pretty pretty complete facility for
building<00:01:20.810> because<00:01:21.110> definitely

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.760 

you<00:01:29.940> probably<00:01:30.300> know<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:31.020> cars<00:01:31.350> changed

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you probably know these cars changed

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
you probably know these cars changed
race<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.550> race<00:01:32.730> we<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.300> lot<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
race to race we do a lot of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.540 
race to race we do a lot of
modifications<00:01:34.530> between<00:01:34.920> races<00:01:35.370> that

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
modifications between races that

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.610 
modifications between races that
development<00:01:36.060> work<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.600> karts<00:01:36.900> continuous

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
development work on the karts continuous

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.600 
development work on the karts continuous
so<00:01:38.520> any<00:01:39.090> minor<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.260> major<00:01:40.460> modifications<00:01:41.460> are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so any minor or major modifications are

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
so any minor or major modifications are
done<00:01:41.640> at<00:01:42.120> these<00:01:42.450> same<00:01:42.720> times<00:01:43.080> when<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> cars

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
done at these same times when the cars

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.280 
done at these same times when the cars
are<00:01:44.430> put<00:01:44.940> back<00:01:45.120> together<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.050> metal

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
are put back together is all the metal

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.430 
are put back together is all the metal
parts<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.710> been<00:01:46.920> checked

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
parts have been checked

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.950 
parts have been checked
reassemble<00:01:49.440> painted<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.420> put<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
reassemble painted and put back on the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
reassemble painted and put back on the
cars<00:01:57.830> now<00:01:58.830> if<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.010> cars<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.400> together<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.940> go

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
cars now if the cars are together we go

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
cars now if the cars are together we go
through<00:02:00.450> what's<00:02:00.899> gotten<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> pretty

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
through what's gotten to be a pretty

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.139 
through what's gotten to be a pretty
routine<00:02:02.130> test<00:02:03.090> procedure<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.840> us<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.200> we

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
routine test procedure for us now we
