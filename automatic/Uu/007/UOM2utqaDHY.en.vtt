about the size of a Robin it's a brown
mottled<00:01:09.850> coloration<00:01:10.540> during<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.930> breeding

mottled coloration during the breeding

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.590 
mottled coloration during the breeding
season<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.860> then<00:01:12.610> during<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.090> winter<00:01:13.390> season

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
season and then during the winter season

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.770 
season and then during the winter season
it's<00:01:14.020> more<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.590> distinct<00:01:15.010> black<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.490> white

it's more of a distinct black and white

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's more of a distinct black and white
this<00:01:16.780> coloration<00:01:17.229> makes<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.310> easier<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:18.640> them

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
this coloration makes it easier for them

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.000 
this coloration makes it easier for them
to<00:01:19.030> avoid<00:01:19.240> predators<00:01:19.510> and<00:01:20.050> then<00:01:20.620> during<00:01:20.860> the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
to avoid predators and then during the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.469 
to avoid predators and then during the
breeding<00:01:21.190> season<00:01:21.490> being<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.240> brown

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
breeding season being in that brown

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.810 
breeding season being in that brown
model<00:01:22.900> color<00:01:23.140> helps<00:01:23.440> them<00:01:23.620> blend<00:01:23.770> into<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
model color helps them blend into the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.550 
model color helps them blend into the
forested<00:01:25.479> environment<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.440> other

forested environment the other

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.740 
forested environment the other
interesting<00:01:27.070> thing<00:01:27.310> about<00:01:27.479> Merlotte's<00:01:28.479> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
interesting thing about Merlotte's and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.810 
interesting thing about Merlotte's and
somewhat<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.380> repetitive<00:01:29.980> of<00:01:30.370> other<00:01:30.520> seabirds

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
somewhat is repetitive of other seabirds

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.430 
somewhat is repetitive of other seabirds
is<00:01:31.240> they're<00:01:31.390> not<00:01:31.510> really<00:01:31.570> very<00:01:32.080> good<00:01:32.290> at

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
is they're not really very good at

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.850 
is they're not really very good at
moving<00:01:32.560> on<00:01:33.070> land<00:01:33.550> their<00:01:34.270> body<00:01:34.660> is<00:01:35.050> designed<00:01:35.500> to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
moving on land their body is designed to

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.310 
moving on land their body is designed to
be<00:01:36.220> swimming<00:01:36.940> underwater<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.870> couple<00:01:38.200> of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
be swimming underwater a couple of

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.080 
be swimming underwater a couple of
interesting<00:01:38.770> things<00:01:39.010> to<00:01:39.160> point<00:01:39.340> out<00:01:39.490> is<00:01:39.760> that

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
interesting things to point out is that

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.450 
interesting things to point out is that
they<00:01:40.420> have<00:01:40.600> webbed<00:01:40.870> feet<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:42.100> makes<00:01:42.280> that

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
they have webbed feet and it makes that

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.430 
they have webbed feet and it makes that
made<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.090> swimming<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.780> well<00:01:43.930> they<00:01:44.260> use

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
made for swimming really well they use

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.110 
made for swimming really well they use
these<00:01:44.620> as<00:01:44.800> a<00:01:44.830> rudder<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.430> they<00:01:45.610> swim<00:01:45.970> with

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
these as a rudder and they swim with

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.530 
these as a rudder and they swim with
their<00:01:46.300> wings<00:01:47.010> but<00:01:48.010> these<00:01:48.340> are<00:01:48.700> also<00:01:49.300> set

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
their wings but these are also set

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.240 
their wings but these are also set
really<00:01:49.840> far<00:01:50.020> back<00:01:50.170> on<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> body<00:01:50.710> as<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.070> can

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
really far back on the body as you can

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.700 
really far back on the body as you can
see<00:01:51.460> which<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.180> also<00:01:52.210> makes<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.110> difficult<00:01:53.350> for

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
see which is also makes it difficult for

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.070 
see which is also makes it difficult for
them<00:01:53.980> to<00:01:54.190> be<00:01:54.340> able<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.730> walk<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.210> land<00:01:55.690> when

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
them to be able to walk on land when

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080 
them to be able to walk on land when
they<00:01:56.350> occur<00:01:57.040> on<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.460> ocean<00:01:57.880> they're

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
they occur on the ocean they're

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.180 
they occur on the ocean they're
generally<00:01:58.540> within<00:01:58.900> about<00:01:59.050> three<00:01:59.530> miles<00:01:59.830> of

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
generally within about three miles of

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.790 
generally within about three miles of
shore<00:02:00.610> but<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.600> varies<00:02:01.930> very<00:02:02.230> dependent<00:02:02.710> upon

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
shore but it varies very dependent upon

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.380 
shore but it varies very dependent upon
where<00:02:03.100> they're<00:02:03.280> out<00:02:03.310> within<00:02:03.700> their<00:02:03.850> range<00:02:04.030> in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
where they're out within their range in

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.970 
where they're out within their range in
some<00:02:04.570> places<00:02:04.840> within<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.440> range<00:02:05.680> they're

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
some places within the range they're

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.040 
some places within the range they're
much<00:02:06.310> closer<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.880> shore<00:02:07.180> they<00:02:07.540> are<00:02:07.660> primarily

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
much closer to shore they are primarily

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.900 
much closer to shore they are primarily
out<00:02:08.259> there<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.649> forage<00:02:09.069> they<00:02:09.310> spend<00:02:09.729> time

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
out there to forage they spend time

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.030 
out there to forage they spend time
there<00:02:10.149> resting<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.290> that's<00:02:11.470> where<00:02:11.680> they<00:02:11.800> mate

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
there resting and that's where they mate

other<00:03:09.319> than<00:03:09.440> when<00:03:09.769> they<00:03:09.890> bring<00:03:10.129> forage<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.910> so

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
other than when they bring forage in so

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.970 
other than when they bring forage in so
they<00:03:11.360> go<00:03:11.540> back<00:03:11.690> out<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.900> see<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.380> adults<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
they go back out to see the adults and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.039 
they go back out to see the adults and
they<00:03:13.670> will<00:03:13.940> catch<00:03:14.269> fish<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.690> they<00:03:14.930> usually

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
they will catch fish and they usually

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.770

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.120 
and feed it to the chick as the chick
gets<00:03:20.329> bigger<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:21.140> they'll<00:03:21.560> bring<00:03:21.739> in<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.980> little

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130
