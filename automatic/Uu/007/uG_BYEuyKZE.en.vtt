00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello youtube I saw something at 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.389
 mr chimp and I thought to myself 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.309
 that from the coquette me so psycho angelo 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.760
 I want to have that too because that was the case 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.630
 i play cool idea that z warrior 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.000
 fender platoon on battlefield 3 dick 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 army in this case not army so much 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 at the chimpanzee chimpanzee army i 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 I want to do the same as he did before 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.130
 We start when you have a consolero 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.960
 since xbox battlefield plays or 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.969
 playstation 3 playstation 4 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 please do not apply for this plate 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.570
 I have no consumption and I will 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 never buy a console 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 I had one that I sold 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.539
 monitor to buy so you can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.110
 Derive what I consoles from 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.149
 shadow think or or let's say 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 I'm just not interested 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.359
 that is, this platinum is only for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.590
 Battlefield 4 player on the pc 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.059
 open 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.409
 that means open any already 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.900
 long but I have somehow never like that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 really promoters but the questions are piling up 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.630
 we can and can gamble 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 we do and I just can not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 That's why we're going to do that now 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170
 do this wise as I do now 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.570
 be the first to explain a normal 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 platoon can take in and out of 100 people 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.710
 rang five times is not yet 50 people 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 to record extra so that means if 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.340
 we play together under the clear 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.829
 take that kfz warrior can change 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.869
 we'll take 50 people later and 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.329
 so on and so forth, I pretty much what 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.979
 cool because it works so you can 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.649
 gamble and we all have a bit 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.299
 fun as I do that with the gamble 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.610
 how do i announce that i am gambling i 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.240
 I'll fix dates 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.950
 Unfortunately, I have never really that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.150
 Overview when I have time to play 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.800
 how it works and so on and so on 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.940
 therefore, I will just commit myself 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.850
 always an hour or two 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.050
 hour and I will then directly 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.970
 when in the private left post 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.610
 I on which server always go one 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.630
 week in advance 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.220
 I will definitely go this week 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.480
 start today even if this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 video will be released tonight i will 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.370
 make the first test match and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.740
 then we will hopefully be one 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.810
 be couple playing under the zdf logo 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.720
 and the symbol, of course, is clear 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.070
 So we come to dates 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.709
 important as you can right now 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.940
 on it now the people are inside 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.780
 they stay in it 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.459
 I have 13 people in there now and look 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 how it feels like that and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.200
 is important when I play 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 I'll be on a second player too 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.030
 times with dlcs without dlc s premium whole 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.459
 no matter if some do not have then 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750
 I'm sorry but you have to then 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.700
 unfortunately I adapt a bit with me 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.100
 can not always just me on that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.690
 restrict basic game because there have 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 maybe others do not mind and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.620
 I honestly also not because I 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.260
 I bought premium from a good 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.489
 reason I get the dlcs cheaper than 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.860
 if I buy them individually and 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.200
 you get extra content so I know 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.959
 not what that is against bremen but that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.930
 another topic is so very important 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.970
 if you just apply for this plates 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.470
 You have to be careful that we do not already 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.690
 in three plates could be the time 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 missing four only be three teams 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.170
 and if you rate yourself then again 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.220
 for mainz then it's not possible then 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.840
 I do not accept you because you stop 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.769
 that's it for the three sides as well 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.330
 true again what is important to me as 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.799
 player when we play together 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.040
 my main criteria are the wied and 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.530
 teamplay 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.170
 I will here not paying wolfs have the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.060
 just camping or as a sniper 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.320
 Do not do your job or anything 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.200
 we play together then we play 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.350
 as a team for the victory and there you can 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.810
 men are now shitting 20 240 on the kilos 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.720
 stand and quarrel because we want 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.580
 then I do not like that at all 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.250
 So that's totally against mine 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.080
 conviction yes I already have 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.810
 saved but then was the team play 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.430
 offs i would like to teamplay 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.380
 build up and the people in the ass 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.910
 and if everything goes well together 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.560
 adds and assembles and maybe can 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.850
 you even go against the campaign 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.910
 to take up the army 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.470
 who knows who knows we will see that 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.030
 so it's not that platoon 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.370
 just like jimi likes to do 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:30.080
 to make fan platoon the same is emblem 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:32.230
 and logo here it is clear again that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.550
 there is no clear day in the sense of 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.140
 we absolutely have to be clear 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.270
 It's just that 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.030
 possibility so that I can be with you 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.620
 can play with you or against you 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.390
 and I would like that too 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.010
 offer just like jim so thank you jim 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.630
 that both have spread that you 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.310
 got me on this idea 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.750
 because who, by the way , again and again 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 in the video description we link 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.260
 will hopefully be a few more 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.520
 projects once even once 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.830
 still in the processing 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.430
 what could it be that's not what 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.470
 is still coming 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.090
 I have now all is said 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.150
 here I think five again 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.680
 minutes so if you want to can 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.550
 I'll go all that far 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.290
 accept look 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.390
 a few names seem familiar and one 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.940
 Maybe not a couple, maybe I will 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.980
 let laska out for example 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.220
 from the current clear because 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.660
 I play privately because I will too 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.330
 play alone and not alone 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.040
 post every game here but set today 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.870
 I first time the clock from 20 o'clock so 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.820
 an hour maybe two hours 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.000
 stays open and then we look 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.360
 times for many warriors we in for 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.690
 then that would be pretty much out of the question 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.760
 that was it first of me yes I hope 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.470
 See you at 8pm this evening 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.370
 on the battlefield to just one 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.380
 to play a few rounds 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.810
 if that is with teamspeak now, believe me 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.310
 I rather not because I would believe that 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.780
 I'm too messy if there are many 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.890
 but you have to watch it maybe 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.020
 maybe I do not do it 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.850
 will then be in gdingen and then 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.530
 maybe only with top power or without 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.030
 Talk power I honestly have none 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.440
 we'll see how it works 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.920
 first a phase we do not look 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.170
 look 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.270
 I'm looking forward to the applications 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.780
 then stop all left not to 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.820
 to forget 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.460
 Here you get the way the first time 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:21.080
 Atomic symbol up emblems bf from the bitkom 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.800
 no matter who I'm somehow wrong 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.990
 pronounced 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.120
 I wash everything again I get by 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.530
 nothing to do with the emblem you can 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.660
 get on this page is also in 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.240
 the video description of the link and that 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.660
 then just added this in life 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.660
 to adjust 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:46.469
 lemmy man in life adapt oh so one 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:48.689
 shit your own emblem you can 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:51.360
 Of course, personally customize with this 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:57.449
 code simply copies and chews them 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.669
 then let's go back today then at 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.300
 you guys here in the same way 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:05.069
 from na where is the code import and 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.960
 copied the here come in import 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.870
 then that builds on save and 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.409
 you're done so far 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.879
 I know I have no premium pictures 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.839
 So that would have to be without problems 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.210
 function 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:20.999
 and then you just skin yourself 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:28.379
 probably here with the soldiers 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:31.649
 again 1000 detours was the one again 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:33.149
 Portrait here it was today then you 

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:35.279
 zdf in and then we play like that 

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:37.199
 together as a team this evening 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:38.159
 I'm pretty curious about how 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:41.899
 many will come 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.899
 but now until then 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.729
 you should also finish the recording 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.729
 until then wide
