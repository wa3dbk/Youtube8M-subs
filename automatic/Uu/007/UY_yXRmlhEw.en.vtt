00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.699
 alessandro here in sweden your debut 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.199
 snow world and you're about to start 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.230
 to do the shakedown 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:20.109
 so many are starting to get serious 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.380
 so many new things the snow the climate of 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.720
 the tires all over the world are with 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.550
 which takes a bit of confidence then 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.349
 we will try to use the shake down for 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.380
 but I also think about the day 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.510
 tomorrow will be a bit of a test try to 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.340
 defend feeling 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.739
 we will try to do the best better than that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.010
 we can my goal is to get in 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.809
 bottom because I think it's a big one 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.300
 possibility that was given to me and not 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.760
 I would absolutely throw it away 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.399
 so then try to do these 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.370
 kilometers better than I can do 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.890
 experience and gratification and so also those 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 my made me be here this is the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.269
 before one of the races he will be doing 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.239
 world because I have heard of a 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.790
 We hope that the project goes through 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.040
 I am already so happy now but 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.760
 is already very well I hope I can 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.560
 continue but now I have to tell the truth 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.640
 I'm focused on this only 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.170
 this race is already enough 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.770
 difficult in itself and for the future 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.220
 we'll see 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.660
 happy without all your gloves 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 son is about to get in the car 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.450
 shake down here in sweden is a beautiful one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.430
 emotion we say that I would have liked 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.430
 maybe have the suit and gloves 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.550
 but let's see why I saw an environment 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.830
 completely different very nice too 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.770
 if he runs with a small car though 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.930
 I see, however, that it is very rewarding 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.970
 this is the first gift I wanted to give 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 Alessandro I know a race 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.080
 very difficult as he confirmed me 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.060
 but we hope that all goes well in 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.350
 so as to be able to have stimuli 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.050
 to be able to continue 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.130
 I know he has a lot of plans in mind 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.240
 important you want to talk about already but I would like 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 try to bring 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.070
 all our fast winning kids 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.349
 that we have in Italy maybe in one 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.849
 team that faces the world citroen 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.709
 will definitely make a very trophy 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.540
 important in the world 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.480
 I'd like to do a team 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.510
 Italian present in the world 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.720
 maybe with young and fast there 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.709
 we are working and see if we can 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.510
 more than anything else to find the budget for 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.500
 to be able to do it 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.909
 the fact remains that I would like it 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.409
 anyway, I also do mine 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.700
 300th race, maybe a race of the 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.840
 the world could be maybe the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.280
 Portugal 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.989
 fabio absent here in a few years 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.640
 sweden however you could not resist to 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.310
 charm of this race 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.750
 here it is difficult to resist the charm 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.360
 when you see snow 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.000
 too much fun was that a few years 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.090
 I didn't come here I decided to come to me 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.470
 we hope he had immediately said 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.790
 that there was no snow then actually 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.860
 we have them found also 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.380
 several in the north tests here maybe 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.030
 towards home there is less but I think the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.770
 fun as always guaranteed 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.330
 this yes myths you have done 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.300
 reconnaissance as evidence 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.660
 well there is a bit of everything there is fast though 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.510
 slow many bumps certainly not easy 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.730
 snow 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.590
 for now everything is covered with snow even if yes 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.400
 begins to see the earth already during the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.689
 reconnaissance so I don't know how much 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.689
 snow remains in the race 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.170
 thank you
