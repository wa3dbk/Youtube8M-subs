in<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.390> cultured<00:01:23.780> pearl<00:01:24.050> industry<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.950> know

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
in the cultured pearl industry you know

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.210 
in the cultured pearl industry you know
freshwater<00:01:25.490> pearls<00:01:26.110> they'll<00:01:27.110> make<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> blank

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
freshwater pearls they'll make a blank

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.560 
freshwater pearls they'll make a blank
from<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.580> shell<00:01:28.790> of<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:28.970> mussel<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.360> little

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
from the shell of the mussel a little

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.760 
from the shell of the mussel a little
bead<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:29.960> they'll<00:01:30.050> insert<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.560> into

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
bead and they'll insert that into

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.770 
bead and they'll insert that into
oysters<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:32.240> if<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.390> have<00:01:32.480> a<00:01:32.540> freshwater

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
oysters and so if you have a freshwater

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.330 
oysters and so if you have a freshwater
pearl<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.530> inside<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.010> pearl<00:01:34.190> is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
pearl the inside of the pearl is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.180 
pearl the inside of the pearl is
actually<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:35.480> round<00:01:35.990> part<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.650> freshwater

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
actually a round part of a freshwater

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:53.800 
actually a round part of a freshwater
mussel<00:01:37.550> show

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.050 

well<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:55.280> filter<00:01:55.790> out<00:01:55.820> water<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.189> the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
well we filter out water so that the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.819 
well we filter out water so that the
water<00:01:59.090> stays<00:01:59.630> cleaner<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.470> clearer<00:02:00.799> and

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
water stays cleaner and clearer and

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.020 
water stays cleaner and clearer and
pressors<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:02.509> they<00:02:02.750> also<00:02:03.789> serve<00:02:04.789> an

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
pressors and then they also serve an

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.010 
pressors and then they also serve an

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.910 
educators and health scientists find out
how<00:02:09.349> clean<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.280> water<00:02:10.489> is<00:02:11.050> see<00:02:12.050> these<00:02:12.200> little

we used to make the little juvenile

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.970 
we used to make the little juvenile
mussels<00:02:24.349> from<00:02:24.940> muscles<00:02:25.940> release<00:02:26.980> these

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
mussels from muscles release these

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580 
mussels from muscles release these
packets<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.850> hold<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.239> larvae<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.380> look

like<00:02:30.799> food<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.459> fish<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.330> two<00:02:32.390> fish<00:02:32.660> see

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
like food to the fish so two fish see

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.539 
like food to the fish so two fish see
them<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.410> they<00:02:33.530> eat<00:02:33.709> them<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.190> when<00:02:34.340> they<00:02:34.489> do

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
them and they eat them and when they do

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.120 
them and they eat them and when they do
that<00:02:34.910> they<00:02:35.750> release<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.350> muscle<00:02:36.739> larvae

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
that they release the muscle larvae

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.089 
that they release the muscle larvae
which<00:02:37.459> attach<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.569> body<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.530> fish<00:02:39.799> and

which attach to the body of the fish and

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.320 
which attach to the body of the fish and

federally listed species it's found and
see<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> primary<00:03:08.319> blue<00:03:09.319> hedgehog<00:03:09.859> oh

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
see this is the primary blue hedgehog oh

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.210 
see this is the primary blue hedgehog oh
and<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.299> found<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:12.140> Virginia<00:03:12.590> West<00:03:13.160> Virginia

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
and it's found in Virginia West Virginia

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.240 
and it's found in Virginia West Virginia
and<00:03:13.579> North<00:03:13.670> Carolina

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.020 

just<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.210> if<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:22.490> well<00:03:23.490> since<00:03:23.850> there

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
just like if you just well since there

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.690 
just like if you just well since there
are<00:03:24.120> larvae<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.600> them<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:24.930> hope<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
are larvae on them we hope that the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.910 
are larvae on them we hope that the
James<00:03:27.000> finding<00:03:27.450> muscle<00:03:27.810> will<00:03:28.080> drop<00:03:28.500> off<00:03:28.710> of

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
James finding muscle will drop off of

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.610 
James finding muscle will drop off of
those<00:03:29.100> fish<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:31.050> start<00:03:31.200> or

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
those fish and that we can start or

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.130 
those fish and that we can start or
establish<00:03:32.130> another<00:03:32.970> population<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.050> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
establish another population here in the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.880 
establish another population here in the
cow<00:03:34.260> pasture<00:03:34.560> River

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.800 

yeah<00:03:37.430> usually<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.880> thing<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.210> like<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.540> try<00:03:38.750> to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
yeah usually the thing I like to try to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.570 
yeah usually the thing I like to try to
impart<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.650> folks<00:03:39.860> about<00:03:40.010> freshwater

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
impart the folks about freshwater

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.610 
impart the folks about freshwater
mussels<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.240> just<00:03:41.480> their<00:03:41.600> importance<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.380> show

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
mussels is just their importance to show

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.820 
mussels is just their importance to show
how<00:03:42.980> healthy<00:03:43.460> streams<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.180> rivers<00:03:44.330> are<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
how healthy streams and rivers are the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.010 
how healthy streams and rivers are the
majority<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.340> our<00:03:46.490> freshwater<00:03:46.870> rivers<00:03:47.870> and

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
majority of our freshwater rivers and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.600 
majority of our freshwater rivers and
streams<00:03:48.290> historically<00:03:48.860> have<00:03:48.980> had<00:03:49.010> freshwater

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
streams historically have had freshwater

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.790 
streams historically have had freshwater
mussel<00:03:50.000> populations<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:50.750> over<00:03:50.960> time<00:03:51.200> those

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
mussel populations and over time those

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.190 
mussel populations and over time those
numbers<00:03:52.490> have<00:03:52.610> decreased<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.960> other

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
numbers have decreased but the other

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.660 
numbers have decreased but the other
streams<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> rivers<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:55.190> still<00:03:55.430> find

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
streams and the rivers you still find

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.970 
streams and the rivers you still find
good<00:03:55.910> numbers<00:03:56.300> are<00:03:56.840> real<00:03:57.350> good<00:03:57.530> for<00:03:57.740> water

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
good numbers are real good for water

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.210 
good numbers are real good for water
quality<00:03:58.240> which<00:03:59.240> also<00:03:59.480> you<00:04:00.440> know<00:04:00.530> translates

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
quality which also you know translates

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.150 
quality which also you know translates
into<00:04:01.490> good<00:04:02.300> recreational<00:04:02.680> opportunities<00:04:03.680> for

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
into good recreational opportunities for

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.280 
into good recreational opportunities for
citizens<00:04:04.820> fishing<00:04:05.210> opportunities<00:04:05.870> swimming

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
citizens fishing opportunities swimming

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.960 
citizens fishing opportunities swimming
opportunities<00:04:06.890> things<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.310> nature<00:04:07.370> so

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
opportunities things of that nature so

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.270 
opportunities things of that nature so
you<00:04:08.960> know<00:04:09.050> while<00:04:09.260> folks<00:04:09.500> may<00:04:09.710> not<00:04:09.890> see<00:04:10.130> the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
you know while folks may not see the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.460 
you know while folks may not see the
direct<00:04:10.640> benefit<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.390> freshwater<00:04:11.690> mussels<00:04:12.320> in

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
direct benefit of freshwater mussels in

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.020 
direct benefit of freshwater mussels in
the<00:04:12.500> river<00:04:12.770> if<00:04:13.130> they<00:04:13.280> may<00:04:13.430> have<00:04:13.580> indirect

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
the river if they may have indirect

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.449 
the river if they may have indirect
benefits<00:04:14.540> even<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.810> drinking<00:04:15.200> water<00:04:15.459> capacity

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
benefits even a drinking water capacity

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.160 
benefits even a drinking water capacity
if<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:17.150> get<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.299> lot<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.570> our<00:04:17.690> drinking<00:04:17.989> water

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
if we get a lot of our drinking water

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.710 
if we get a lot of our drinking water
from<00:04:18.440> rivers<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.190> streams<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:19.790> if<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.630> have

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
from rivers and streams so if you have

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.210 
from rivers and streams so if you have
freshwater<00:04:21.140> mussel<00:04:21.470> populations<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.160> are

freshwater mussel populations that are

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.830 
freshwater mussel populations that are
usually<00:04:22.370> being<00:04:22.640> indication<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.450> water
