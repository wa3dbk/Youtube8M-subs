00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
of smooth feel you know I know it's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.280 
of smooth feel you know I know it's
still<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> dual-core<00:01:56.369> device<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.750> it's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
still a dual-core device but is it's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
still a dual-core device but is it's
just<00:01:58.439> made<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> feel<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.399> another

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
just made it feel like I'm another

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
just made it feel like I'm another
quad-core<00:02:00.060> device<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.990> give<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.560> of

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
quad-core device it give that kind of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
quad-core device it give that kind of
galaxy<00:02:02.070> s3<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> feel<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.909> me<00:02:03.210> enough<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
galaxy s3 kind of feel to me enough to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.359 
galaxy s3 kind of feel to me enough to
this<00:02:03.780> device<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.710> hopefully<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.100> probably

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
this device and hopefully you probably

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.980 
this device and hopefully you probably
see<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.840> nice

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
see you know it's not like the nice

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.650 
see you know it's not like the nice
animations<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.039> how

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
animations and how

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.630 
animations and how
faster<00:02:08.930> smooth<00:02:09.140> actually<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.680> when<00:02:10.520> you're

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
faster smooth actually is when you're

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.130 
faster smooth actually is when you're
going<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:10.910> applications<00:02:11.510> as<00:02:11.600> well<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:12.020> know

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
going to applications as well you know

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140 
going to applications as well you know
everything<00:02:12.680> itself<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.670> know<00:02:13.760> jumping

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
everything itself you know jumping

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
everything itself you know jumping
around<00:02:14.770> trumpeting<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> other

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
around trumpeting to on to the other

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.480 
around trumpeting to on to the other
going<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.300> out<00:02:17.710> he's<00:02:18.710> got<00:02:18.920> all<00:02:19.010> those<00:02:19.130> calls

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
going back out he's got all those calls

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.610 
going back out he's got all those calls
coming<00:02:19.820> in<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.390> out<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.960> out<00:02:21.020> popping<00:02:21.530> in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
coming in and out in and out popping in

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.860 
coming in and out in and out popping in
and<00:02:21.710> out<00:02:21.830> don't<00:02:22.730> multitask<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.450> bad<00:02:23.630> boy

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and out don't multitask in this bad boy

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.110 
and out don't multitask in this bad boy
you<00:02:24.140> know<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.070> quite<00:02:25.340> expensive<00:02:25.790> ever

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
better look so obviously the top here

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
better look so obviously the top here
you<00:03:00.080> know<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.560> probably<00:03:00.860> see<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.700> if<00:03:01.940> you

it down you know obviously over you can
see<00:03:13.340> there<00:03:13.760> what<00:03:14.480> we'll<00:03:14.630> do<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.900> was<00:03:14.990> will<00:03:15.140> zoom

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
see there what we'll do it was will zoom

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.930 
see there what we'll do it was will zoom
back<00:03:15.500> out<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.250> they'll<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.580> able<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.730> see<00:03:16.880> you

back out and they'll be able to see you
properly<00:03:17.180> owl<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:18.350> as<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.680> got<00:03:18.830> further<00:03:18.860> down

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
properly owl is as you got further down

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.120 
properly owl is as you got further down
