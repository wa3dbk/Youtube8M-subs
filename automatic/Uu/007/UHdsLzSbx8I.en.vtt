 the description well guys because they are the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 news from a little while ago you know that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.510
 recently that piece of nintendo came out 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 direct in which I tell you a lot of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.750
 new news and the happy ones will be 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.820
 the same video that you will have here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.130
 up so if you have not seen it already 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.050
 you know go through why it is really 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.719
 awesome the work that had me 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 put in for that video and how am I 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.180
 observing I have gone back to the labels 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.160
 because they seem very easy to use 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 for people who want to see a 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 news or want to see other news about 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.649
 interest that little part of the video without 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.010
 that to use them the two news are 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 I like really good again and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 but I'm going to start with luigi's 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.700
 mansion 2 or also called dark moon 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.950
 for nintendo 3ds will have mode 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.840
 recently contains a video that would have 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.400
 a multiplayer mode although you did not know 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.170
 if it was going to be online or it was not going to be 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.420
 online and I said that surely not 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.060
 out online that will be a local mode that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.560
 it would not be a cooperative and others know 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.110
 that this online mode will not be cooperative 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 but you will have a is so cooperative is the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.680
 way I want to say is not cooperative in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.020
 the story not to play the story of 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.670
 the players or I think so for now I do not know 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.970
 has said nothing is a cooperative mode 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.600
 online in a so- called mode I have it here 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.259
 has pointed counter mode is worth mode 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.180
 hunter hunting will be cooperative and by 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:46.960
 what do I say this because it consists of climbing 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.119
 a tower with one floor and another four 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.720
 up to four players who are Luis from 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.030
 Different colors can be seen in 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.290
 team to marry the ghosts of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.920
 each level 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.320
 at the beginning the players will choose 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.990
 how many levels do you want to overcome between 10 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.720
 or 25 I think I've read and the level of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.100
 difficulty then when you finish a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.870
 full salary level 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 such and such and receive a reward 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.250
 the better they do it, the better reward 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.800
 they receive by now you do not know anything else they 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.840
 is fun is a cooperative mode that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.820
 the truth is very funny and it is 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.740
 online that is confirmed to be 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.130
 completely online have only been seen 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.990
 in 4 louis of different colors which 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.720
 It's not bad but it would be cool to see others 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.530
 characters from the world of mario within 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.110
 that piece of game if a player dies 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.390
 that I was reading them right now if a game with 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.810
 dies we can resurrect the same as 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.240
 we can do in nintendo land in the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.160
 mini game of Luigi's mansion that 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.250
 I suppose it will be lit with lanterns 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.700
 and we can relive it the second news 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.090
 is that a new game of 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.140
 sonic for all platforms including 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.610
 for the playstation 4 and xbox 720 is 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.200
 amazing because it still has not been it is not 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.360
 they have not left and they are already doing the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.870
 game how awesome this game is 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.849
 that takes 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.519
 in development takes the development before 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.110
 that sonic generations that I think was 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.599
 the last heart and that is activated before 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.340
 even that this game is that it has 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.260
 It makes a good game but it does not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.099
 the shit and there are many rumors that it would be 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.980
 the next 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.690
 sonic adventure or adventure 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.909
 adventure as you want to say it but for 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.760
 me is to that grace a better saga and has 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.730
 out of ass you want 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.340
 I love sonic adventure always on 2 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.980
 for me it's my favorite solÃ­s game and 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.680
 if they get a 3 would be super happy 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.870
 very much rumor we are quite 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.629
 enough information about the game are 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.099
 all the bonuses that please we have not 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.650
 I go out a lot to get excited a lot with 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.690
 these things but I tell you 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.379
 for all platforms which I have already 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.950
 said both pc ps vita ds wii play brings 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.140
 of equipment 2 all is worth the PC version 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.569
 and half will be identical this by the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.819
 visual quality of each the video game 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.260
 against share in 2d and 3d as we have 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.090
 been watching in the last games of 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.760
 sonic very multiple routes in each of 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.459
 the phases I do not know if I can tell you 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.690
 for one place or another it's worth because this 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.340
 will give multiple routes since we have gone 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.110
 watching sonic games worth we can 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.849
 put in one place or another but to the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.280
 end we always end up at the same point 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.410
 I do not know if there will be different endings in 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.210
 every phase thing that is pretty good 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.889
 each stage unlock a new 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.810
 character and this is what makes me 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.820
 think that it will be a sonic adventure 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.449
 because in the ventoux actions 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.099
 we have always had a lot of possibility 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.050
 of choosing between characters and this 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.789
 small tumor cited that each stage of 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.460
 block was a new character is what 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.320
 it gives me to think that it will be a new game 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.820
 of the saga each character will have 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.240
 your odds as always 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.060
 we will have roasted snacks the sonic 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.530
 I'm liking the rumors too much 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.180
 the truth is that it always happens to us what 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.759
 same rumors are too nice to 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.060
 be true what I do know is almost certain 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.139
 announced in February is worth every 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.229
 stage can be played with different 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.259
 characters you will know 20 acts worth without 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.120
 count the bosses the 3ds version will be 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.090
 similar but with another idea it will be a type 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.169
 sonics bruce ras of sonic chords 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.590
 bucks does not stop for dsi that will be one thing 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.720
 similar to a bad vision that is 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.180
 that I would consider that seville the 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.639
 pc wii if you have it 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.110
 and I know he has his best 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.360
 developers in each version the 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.039
 It really is amazing I have 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.880
 very much I also want to know what 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.949
 it is this 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.350
 I will bring it to the channel because it has done 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.180
 this news or it touches me and if it is not only 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.610
 of nintendo because it has to do with wii 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.350
 wii 3ds and I also love they are 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.759
 any news sonic group 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.199
 that is not for nintendo I think 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.000
 attract because in me one of my 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.070
 favorite characters so a greeting 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.630
 he said goodbye I fell many thanks 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.729
 for spending this little time with me 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.110
 soon I will continue with the game 3 much me 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.130
 is saying mega when I assumed mario 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.740
 zombie 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.479
 2 that until I did not get news 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.660
 guys I do not like to go up gameplays 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.550
 because my channel is news is worth 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.110
 until we are all finished 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.330
 he says yes I think he's done with everything 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.889
 along with edited pull the other day and 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.840
 with that today I have finished with the news 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.360
 most important at the moment so what 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.370
 next will be gameplays a greeting should be 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.370
 that there are hatreds to all
