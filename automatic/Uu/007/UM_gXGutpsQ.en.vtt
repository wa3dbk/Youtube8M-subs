start<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.770> get<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.890> bit<00:02:03.009> faster<00:02:03.550> then<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.119> does

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
start to get a bit faster then it does

tend to understeer a bit no rule means

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.100 
tend to understeer a bit no rule means
the<00:02:06.729> car<00:02:06.940> isn't<00:02:07.060> as<00:02:07.180> much<00:02:07.240> fun<00:02:07.390> astern<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:07.990> like

a<00:02:08.340> master<00:02:09.340> 3<00:02:09.759> another<00:02:10.690> problem<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.260> have

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
a master 3 another problem that I have

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.040 
a master 3 another problem that I have
is<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.280> ride<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:13.270> quite<00:02:13.510> hard<00:02:13.900> I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
is that the ride is really quite hard I

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.510 
is that the ride is really quite hard I
mean<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.290> might<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.440> noticed<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> camera

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
mean you might have noticed the camera

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.860 
mean you might have noticed the camera
wobbling<00:02:16.060> about<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.480> bit<00:02:16.600> there<00:02:16.840> that's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
wobbling about it a bit there that's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.020 
wobbling about it a bit there that's
because<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.709> kind<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.980> jiggles<00:02:18.489> about<00:02:18.790> ever

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
because it kind of jiggles about ever

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.120 
because it kind of jiggles about ever
rough<00:02:19.270> surfaces<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.080> if<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> hit<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.800> larger

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
rough surfaces and if you hit a larger

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.910 
rough surfaces and if you hit a larger
bump<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.459> get<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> nasty<00:02:22.209> jolt<00:02:22.770> also<00:02:23.770> another

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
bump you get a nasty jolt also another

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.949 
bump you get a nasty jolt also another
problem<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.150> noise<00:02:25.390> because<00:02:25.810> it's

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
problem I have is the noise because it's

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.260 
problem I have is the noise because it's
quite<00:02:26.260> quite<00:02:26.890> loud<00:02:27.190> inside<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.820> cabin

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
quite quite loud inside this cabin

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.570 
quite quite loud inside this cabin
really<00:02:28.630> has<00:02:29.470> made<00:02:29.680> worse<00:02:29.980> by<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.220> fact<00:02:30.340> that

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
really has made worse by the fact that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.630 
really has made worse by the fact that
the<00:02:30.760> petrol<00:02:31.120> engines<00:02:31.480> are<00:02:32.110> quite<00:02:32.500> booming<00:02:33.430> at

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
the petrol engines are quite booming at

the petrol engines are quite booming at
higher<00:02:33.910> revs<00:02:34.209> they<00:02:34.390> kind<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.690> scream<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> bit

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
higher revs they kind of scream a bit

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.900 
higher revs they kind of scream a bit
and<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.739> don't<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.100> 6th<00:02:36.459> gear<00:02:36.700> which

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
and you don't have a 6th gear which

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.979 
and you don't have a 6th gear which
makes<00:02:37.150> matters<00:02:37.840> worse<00:02:42.690> that's<00:02:43.690> where<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
makes matters worse that's where the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.240 
makes matters worse that's where the
problems<00:02:44.320> well<00:02:44.530> I'm<00:02:44.709> not<00:02:44.830> totally<00:02:44.980> sure<00:02:45.130> about
