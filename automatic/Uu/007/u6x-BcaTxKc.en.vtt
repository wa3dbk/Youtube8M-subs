00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and we're with today we're really going to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.089
 have a spectacular 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 because people ask what is the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.059
 drop and it also sounds when we're 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.620
 painting in clear because initially 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's say in europe in germany 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.859
 they precisely formulated this material 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.320
 to be able to contain the paint that is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.380
 so difficult to contain in a support 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 like silk but they started the theme 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 of the drop, because we have some 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.830
 models that we are going to see later in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.840
 the tee but so they can see that the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 drop can be used for everything to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 different types of supports in 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.070
 definitive when arrived here we have in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.780
 reality in Latin America is very difficult 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.840
 get natural silk there are no silks 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.690
 natural then this what is important is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.090
 that this experience and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 look for other applications because of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.289
 another way it would not be possible to understand more 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 I like it and I like it because in the box 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.520
 that we have here and also they will not see 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.170
 now there are many ways to use 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.070
 because it's easy because you can adapt 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 look for word graphics and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.120
 others and as it remains exact chubby 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.250
 It has a variety of incredible colors 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.860
 it gives you for all the good ones that the idea 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.390
 is that they are inspired, they are encouraged to mix 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.460
 materials sometimes people are afraid 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.020
 and is afraid to recycle materials 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.270
 now he commented to her now it is used a lot in 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.250
 mixed media and the average mix 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.930
 use mix everything right but good 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.150
 every time we leave ourselves 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.080
 also discovering these things by not 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.610
 see In the absence of good nature 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.130
 move us artificial tips with 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.970
 another type of silk on paper on 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.650
 wood on glass and I was missing one that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.470
 I still did not mention it because I have to 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.700
 try it but it's like this this about other 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.700
 support but I do not want to say 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.050
 before the end of the year 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.230
 you have it outside or to give the guy there 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.230
 they have it with perfect for them to do it 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.399
 good to me here we are demonstrating 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.920
 how the different jousts can be 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.330
 Apply on different supports by 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.340
 example on natural or artificial silk 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 which is initially about which this 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.690
 product was formulated with the intention 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.890
 clearly contain the paintings without 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.930
 However, we can also 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.040
 use the drop over another type of 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.650
 fabrics for example batiste in this case 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.450
 accompanying the decoration of techniques 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.000
 like decoupage and painting on canvas 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.130
 giving him some fillets with like 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.680
 golden yes 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.330
 but I'm very interested in pointing out that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 this type of products also the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.620
 we can use for example to 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 make decorations on wood 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.890
 or 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.660
 decorations in this case 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.349
 on glass in this case is a glass 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.610
 frosted can observe how it was 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.840
 colored with after in the help of 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.610
 Acrylics mixed with the varnish 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.730
 bright water and what always up 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.769
 Now I have done in my pictures is to apply 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.769
 the drop as a decoration 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.959
 now let's show how we can 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.189
 make the application with like in this 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.480
 case I am working with the white drop 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.480
 directly applying 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.030
 the drop 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.890
 in every sense 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.720
 notice how different it is let's say the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.060
 material with regard to what is 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.370
 down which is the white acrylic 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.730
 and this is due to the characteristic relief 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.959
 of this material and the same 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.849
 I will perform by demonstrating with another tone 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.040
 of like because there are so many of us 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.830
 different tastes that can be mate 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.830
 pearl 2 we make on glass 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.019
 I always advise that once 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.780
 let's apply before applying for forgiveness 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.750
 this material should say that 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.030
 glass supports are cleaned very well 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.540
 this surface with alcohol for 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.690
 just allow a better adhesion 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.460
 of these products is very interesting 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.669
 work with these materials 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.810
 for the subject of the beak is very fine and I 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.740
 allows to make fast strokes 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.740
 spontaneous about all this kind of 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.740
 supports 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.790
 ah 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.520
 and divine I stay shirt with 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.170
 sheet you saw if I'm going to give you likes 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.330
 so that the cores and also here 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.330
 could decorate with like leader 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:27.140
 let's experiment together side what 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.710
 that we can get to see does not go with line 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.710
 you know what 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.250
 plante has a complete range of 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.920
 products for painters the best 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.290
 acrylic and fabric tones accessories 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.310
 variety of stencil and varnishes 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:50.110
 water novel models on napkins 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.110
 complete the artistic line of plant
