00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.010 
not that familiar with the seuss seuss
is<00:02:24.790> one<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> few<00:02:25.360> companies<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
is one of the few companies in the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.400 
is one of the few companies in the
market<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.950> basically<00:02:27.670> does<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.600> all<00:02:28.750> so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
market that basically does it all so

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.690 
market that basically does it all so
they<00:02:29.560> designed<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.100> phone

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
they designed the phone

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.380 
they designed the phone
they<00:02:31.330> manufacture<00:02:31.990> as<00:02:32.680> well<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> few<00:02:34.150> years

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
they manufacture as well so a few years

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.240 
they manufacture as well so a few years
ago<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> soos<00:02:35.080> actually<00:02:35.500> had<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.770> branch<00:02:35.980> off

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
ago a soos actually had to branch off

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.330 
ago a soos actually had to branch off
from<00:02:36.660> Pegatron<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.110> Pegatron<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> Souza's

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
from Pegatron so Pegatron is a Souza's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.370 
from Pegatron so Pegatron is a Souza's
odf<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.390> that's<00:02:40.570> actually<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.930> company<00:02:41.230> that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
odf so that's actually the company that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.920 
odf so that's actually the company that
manufactures<00:02:42.250> their<00:02:42.520> products<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.540> reason

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
manufactures their products the reason

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.720 
manufactures their products the reason
why<00:02:44.050> they<00:02:44.230> had<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.530> split<00:02:44.740> off<00:02:44.920> was<00:02:45.250> because<00:02:45.280> it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
why they had to split off was because it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.960 
why they had to split off was because it
became<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.780> know<00:02:46.930> not<00:02:47.830> really<00:02:48.190> cool<00:02:48.460> for<00:02:48.940> a

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
became you know not really cool for a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.510 
became you know not really cool for a
company<00:02:49.420> that's<00:02:49.600> manufacturing<00:02:50.590> hardware

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
company that's manufacturing hardware

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.610 
company that's manufacturing hardware
for<00:02:51.790> other<00:02:51.970> companies<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.930> be<00:02:53.050> owned<00:02:53.290> by<00:02:53.470> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
for other companies to be owned by a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.940 
for other companies to be owned by a
suit<00:02:53.980> there<00:02:54.640> was<00:02:54.910> some<00:02:55.210> talk<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.570> well<00:02:56.200> maybe

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
suit there was some talk that well maybe

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.110 
suit there was some talk that well maybe
it<00:02:57.130> was<00:02:57.310> Dell<00:02:57.610> or<00:02:57.940> HP<00:02:57.970> or<00:02:58.570> one<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> those<00:02:58.930> guys

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
it was Dell or HP or one of those guys

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.700 
it was Dell or HP or one of those guys
submitted<00:03:01.120> their<00:03:01.330> products<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.840> Pegatron<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
submitted their products to Pegatron and

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.460 
submitted their products to Pegatron and
then<00:03:02.980> was<00:03:03.790> worried<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.270> maybe<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.960> soos<00:03:05.260> was

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
then was worried that maybe a soos was

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.690 
then was worried that maybe a soos was
getting<00:03:05.710> pretty<00:03:05.890> too<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> lot<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.550> this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
getting pretty too a lot of this

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.480 
getting pretty too a lot of this
information<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.650> company<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.100> divided

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
information so the company is divided

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.870 
information so the company is divided
but<00:03:10.150> essentially<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:11.110> soos<00:03:11.650> has<00:03:11.980> Pettit<00:03:12.490> Ron<00:03:12.700> as

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
but essentially a soos has Pettit Ron as

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.690 
but essentially a soos has Pettit Ron as
its<00:03:13.060> dedicated<00:03:13.770> manufacturing<00:03:14.770> base<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.250> so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
its dedicated manufacturing base and so

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.570 
its dedicated manufacturing base and so
when<00:03:15.940> you're<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.120> company<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.590> design

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
when you're a company that can design

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.330 
when you're a company that can design
and<00:03:19.350> manufacture<00:03:20.350> control<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.980> entire

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
and manufacture control the entire

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.280 
and manufacture control the entire
process<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:22.090> how<00:03:22.150> your<00:03:22.510> devices<00:03:22.990> come<00:03:23.140> to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
process of how your devices come to

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.530 
process of how your devices come to
