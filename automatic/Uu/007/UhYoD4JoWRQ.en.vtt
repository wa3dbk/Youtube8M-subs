Vietnam<00:00:02.879> they<00:00:03.480> just<00:00:03.689> signed<00:00:03.929> an<00:00:04.140> agreement

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
Vietnam they just signed an agreement

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.030 
Vietnam they just signed an agreement
with<00:00:04.650> their<00:00:04.890> first<00:00:06.259> licensee<00:00:07.259> in<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.649> market

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
with their first licensee in the market

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.459 
with their first licensee in the market
so<00:00:08.189> that's<00:00:08.280> pretty<00:00:08.580> exciting<00:00:08.849> news<00:00:09.260> it's<00:00:10.260> not

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
so that's pretty exciting news it's not

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.169 
so that's pretty exciting news it's not
necessarily<00:00:11.099> surprising<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.820> have<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> lot<00:00:12.150> of

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
necessarily surprising we have a lot of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.759 
necessarily surprising we have a lot of
chains<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.809> moved<00:00:13.019> into<00:00:13.200> Vietnam<00:00:13.590> in

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
chains that have moved into Vietnam in

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.589 
chains that have moved into Vietnam in
the<00:00:13.830> last<00:00:14.040> few<00:00:14.309> years<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.210> think

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the last few years but I think

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.029 
the last few years but I think
McDonald's<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.470> sort<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.680> particularly

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
McDonald's is sort of particularly

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.920 
McDonald's is sort of particularly
symbolic<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.449> such<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> huge

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
symbolic just because it's such a huge

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.859 
symbolic just because it's such a huge
Western<00:00:19.830> chain<00:00:20.160> moving<00:00:20.550> into<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> country<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
Western chain moving into a country that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.029 
Western chain moving into a country that
we<00:00:21.960> kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> complicated<00:00:22.890> history

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
we kind of have a complicated history

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
we kind of have a complicated history
with<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.869> want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> talk<00:00:25.380> first<00:00:25.590> about

Vietnam and in sort of broad terms it's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400 
Vietnam and in sort of broad terms it's
a<00:00:28.410> unique<00:00:28.740> market<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.340> terms<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.260> size<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the market and the change penetration in

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.209 
the market and the change penetration in

33 billion dollar market which is huge
its<00:00:40.559> its<00:00:40.950> top<00:00:41.460> 20<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.879> terms<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
its its top 20 in terms of all the

its its top 20 in terms of all the
global<00:00:43.260> markets<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.739> cover<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
global markets we cover and it's a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.720 
global markets we cover and it's a
really<00:00:45.030> big<00:00:45.329> market<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> untapped

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
really big market with a lot of untapped

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.729 
really big market with a lot of untapped
potential<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> bring<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.620> just

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
potential if you bring that down to just

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
potential if you bring that down to just
chains<00:00:50.280> only<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:51.270> come<00:00:51.480> down<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> two<00:00:51.960> hundred

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
chains only we come down to two hundred

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
chains only we come down to two hundred
sixteen<00:00:52.590> million<00:00:52.829> dollars<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
sixteen million dollars so that's a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.750 
sixteen million dollars so that's a
really<00:00:54.210> tiny<00:00:54.800> chained<00:00:55.800> segment<00:00:56.579> there's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
really tiny chained segment there's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.639 
really tiny chained segment there's
virtually<00:00:57.270> no<00:00:57.449> penetration<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
virtually no penetration at all in that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
virtually no penetration at all in that
really<00:00:58.890> big<00:00:59.129> market<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:01.109> kind<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
really big market so that can kind of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
really big market so that can kind of
mean<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.340> things<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> either<00:01:02.969> means

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
mean one of two things that either means

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.450 
mean one of two things that either means
there's<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> lot<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> untapped<00:01:04.019> demand<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
there's a lot of untapped demand that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
there's a lot of untapped demand that
these<00:01:05.610> chains<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.950> make

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
these chains can go in and kind of make

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
these chains can go in and kind of make
me<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.340> hit<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> ground<00:01:08.580> running<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
me really hit the ground running but it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
me really hit the ground running but it
can<00:01:09.600> also<00:01:09.780> mean<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.850> consumers<00:01:11.850> there

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
can also mean that consumers there

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
can also mean that consumers there
really<00:01:12.210> aren't<00:01:12.479> familiar<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:13.409> chain<00:01:13.830> food

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
really aren't familiar with chain food

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
really aren't familiar with chain food
service<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.119> could<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.840> know

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
service at all so they could you know

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.609 
service at all so they could you know
really<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> struggle<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> terms<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.330> just

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
really have a struggle in terms of just

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.230 
really have a struggle in terms of just
introducing<00:01:19.619> consumers<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.310> -<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.119> know

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
introducing consumers there - you know

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
introducing consumers there - you know
what<00:01:21.479> chain<00:01:21.720> food<00:01:21.960> service<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> even<00:01:22.710> all

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
what chain food service is even all

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
what chain food service is even all
about<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> unique<00:01:24.750> market<00:01:25.170> in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
about so it's kind of a unique market in

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.109 
about so it's kind of a unique market in
those<00:01:25.530> terms<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.820> talk<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> little

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
those terms I also want to talk a little

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
those terms I also want to talk a little
bit<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.840> why<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.380> why<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
bit about you know why now why is

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
bit about you know why now why is
McDonald's<00:01:29.220> picking<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.880> moment<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
McDonald's picking this moment to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
McDonald's picking this moment to
finally<00:01:30.600> move<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> market<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.670> there's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
actually a lot of chains that are

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840 
actually a lot of chains that are
already<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.890> within<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.579> two<00:01:35.759> hundred

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
