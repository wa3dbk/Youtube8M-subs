00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.920
 teacher of art history daniela forensic I also attended a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.150
 this project in which way 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.019
 if I am the coordinator together with other teachers of this project 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.579
 if we thought of dedicating it ahahah magically and clearly playing 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.989
 on the ambiguity of the term it is magically seeking weather adverb of fashion 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.890
 not a magical way of doing things but also because it is our brain 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.119
 our mind can be invested for an prejudice 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.920
 to free the imagination and to go beyond the ordinary the ordinary 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.020
 in fact we have proposed our pupils to indulge themselves a little they give to go beyond 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.410
 what is the normal educational activity that takes place during the year 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410
 hey also produce and their jobs on the way 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.230
 certainly relevant because being an institution where graphics are also made 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.350
 obvious that if you express yourself dead with the image 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.630
 so here at our moment there are both project sections of 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.730
 classes and then buyvip professors who have coordinated their own projects have 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.650
 guided the boys in the achievements like the one behind us if 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.780
 free jobs instead of single boys who have made themselves known sum they have 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.440
 expressed their and graphic expressive artistic capabilities hey 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.340
 figurative in general 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.680
 the contribution of francesco scagliosi was also very important 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.720
 straw hunter for the realization of this project 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.660
 this project has a photographic project cost presented here just know 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.510
 you and is part among other things how many projects are not born directly 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.910
 from the exhibition are the jobs that are done during the year that in this school 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.880
 posed in particular cost for photographic works 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.670
 I was given maximum freedom and boys who chose September 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.299
 serial interpretations which is nothing but an interpretation of the di 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.729
 sculptures of the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 neoclassicism 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.880
 and have been interpreted quite amusingly ironically by the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.979
 part of the boys 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.700
 in complete freedom 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.840
 what I would like to say that I would like to stress popopopopo of freedom 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.939
 why 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:15.109
 it is like saying to underline precisely the creative aunt aspect of the school 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.719
 set of objects 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.849
 and thinks that this way girls have succeeded 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.229
 to meet this or this need 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.909
 then a photography expert if we want to give some advice to those who are there 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.259
 listen to what they are 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.389
 and the most rita to make a good photograph 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.939
 then in this school mail 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.969
 cakes photography as I love the practical aspect is very much 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.790
 theory, no doubt, I let the kids get their hands on the materials 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.209
 on equipment 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.420
 and thanks to these methods we have at home we succeed 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.139
 pulls the best part out of the boys in this sense as much as 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.139
 important a good camera and how much instead 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.610
 and the imagination of those who took care of taking photographs 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.720
 this case is that I would not like to say trivia 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.500
 the camera is very important. the other the photograph 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.630
 actually the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.310
 it is linked to the technical aspect from the equipment but it is always anyway 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.279
 very important behind the camera 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.409
 here instead it deals more with graphics than anything else 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.500
 i broke his photography the boys like how we can work graphic of 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:26.199
 little 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.799
 then photo editing and photography that were the good girls not retouched 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.949
 we have the pc and me classroom 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.529
 girl I sleep with the latest programs in close contact with companies 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.510
 in fact with abrao also with clothes away here 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.399
 but the various companies where boys 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:42.629
 but actually work getting wet 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.189
 they have fun working in parliament in the world of graphics 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.199
 it was difficult and 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.109
 and therefore i help these kids project sextant because yes 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.219
 they have fun they feel like they are without love secrets as they are 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 fun 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.699
 and creativity 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.759
 what times instead of preparation 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.199
 those are the times 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.650
 d finally massacred disk. in a video 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.099
 anna anna company word voluntarily girls knows me do better 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.349
 other origin found in the curriculum 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.609
 to close next year there will undoubtedly be a new project 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.209
 I think about changing something 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.300
 something changes if they are always changing because they are always changing 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.330
 this year we did 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.550
 eggs the living crib manifestations thinking and scenographies 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.249
 photographic exhibitions we always update as the web cam graphics step with 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:33.620
 hand with the times 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.219
 students who help in the project also by giving new ideas 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.990
 surely they are only my business if we are always new and above all 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.020
 poinx also want us to work if salveeeee from input to the end 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.909
 to close one last question 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.839
 also to hyenas next year so we said there will be a new project 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.749
 always and with this change some ideas 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.189
 always connected to what I said before 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.479
 -d to the practical sense of the photographic operation what 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.180
 newlyweds stat breed I miss a laying room a 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.589
 at a professional level 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.589
 hence the project from next year will be 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.240
 it will certainly be more beautiful 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.440
 preparations are underway regarding 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.520
 at this event 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.240
 and how everything proceeds 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.110
 six precedes quite well these are boys who participated in a 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.990
 corso can ferrara clown school yesterday 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.920
 to acquire the techniques 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.340
 d animation is mainly the experience of smile therapy 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.590
 this year we did 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.000
 in the hospital, the play library department has allowed us to test the acquired skills 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.680
 from the pupils tires have had an excellent relapse 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.680
 it is easy to go on these raspberries 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.159
 are not allowed. 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.520
 you needed a preparation 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.360
 you have enough balance and 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.099
 one must know oneself e 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.449
 let's say 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.639
 have a lot of will more than anything else as days 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.379
 do not do in a few minutes in a few minutes if so many fake fall I hope not 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.400
 I am sorry for you 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.150
 half an hour the exorcist 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.690
 my soul. so it's not very complicated 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.200
 because as regards the make-up obviously and you do it alone or e 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.550
 there is help from some leccenight teacher 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.550
 however mind of people. years 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.080
 the three companions who have learned to touch because today they are touched 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.980
 but the system is that of the truccabimbi 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.870
 so give the child the chance to become the character of 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.620
 fantasy that he also wants this is a technique that our girls have 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.550
 taken with this course 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.669
 ny to be in contact with the little ones surely a beautiful thing 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.339
 yes yes it is not pleasant 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.409
 is very funny 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:02.179
 hey you also enjoy tearing and smiles in the a to do a little 

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.609
