genmark<00:03:22.720> marmac<00:03:23.410> can<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.769> confirm<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.480> we

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
genmark marmac can you confirm that we

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.960 
genmark marmac can you confirm that we
can't<00:03:25.690> confirm<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.109> at<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.680> time<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.040> he's

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
can't confirm that at this time but he's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.360 
can't confirm that at this time but he's
been<00:03:28.420> one<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.440> opponent's<00:03:29.950> that's<00:03:30.160> being

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
been one of the opponent's that's being

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.840 
been one of the opponent's that's being
considered<00:03:30.940> and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
considered and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.850 
considered and
I<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.690> would<00:03:33.840> be<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.050> thing<00:03:34.530> fight<00:03:34.710> as

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
I think that would be a thing fight as

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.520 
I think that would be a thing fight as
well<00:03:35.010> be<00:03:35.280> another<00:03:35.430> European<00:03:35.940> fighter<00:03:36.180> and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
well be another European fighter and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.670 
well be another European fighter and
it's<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.740> uh<00:03:38.000> Vladimir<00:03:39.000> would<00:03:39.210> just<00:03:39.390> keep

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680
