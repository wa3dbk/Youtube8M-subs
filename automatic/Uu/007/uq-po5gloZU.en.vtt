00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
like bacteria in a petri dish the force

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.550 
like bacteria in a petri dish the force
goes<00:00:03.030> through<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.480> particles<00:00:04.140> tried<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.410> head

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
goes through the particles tried to head

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.740 
goes through the particles tried to head
towards<00:00:04.920> it<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.220> then<00:00:05.339> once<00:00:05.520> it's<00:00:05.670> gone<00:00:05.879> they

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
towards it and then once it's gone they

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.810 
towards it and then once it's gone they
then<00:00:07.280> reestablished<00:00:08.280> their<00:00:08.429> distance<00:00:08.760> from

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
then reestablished their distance from

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.940 
then reestablished their distance from
each<00:00:09.030> other<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.840> keeper<00:00:10.260> part<00:00:10.469> comes<00:00:10.679> into

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
each other the keeper part comes into

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.470 
each other the keeper part comes into
effect<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.460> particles<00:00:11.940> push<00:00:12.150> each<00:00:12.300> other

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
effect and the particles push each other

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.189 
effect and the particles push each other
away<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.170> each<00:00:13.440> other<00:00:14.960> so<00:00:15.960> there<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.170> go

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
away from each other so there you go

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.050 
away from each other so there you go
there<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.619> that's<00:00:16.710> actually<00:00:16.890> quite<00:00:17.130> cool<00:00:17.430> now

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
there so that's actually quite cool now

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.910 
there so that's actually quite cool now
this<00:00:18.449> actually<00:00:18.660> wouldn't<00:00:19.050> happen<00:00:19.199> if<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.470> we

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
this actually wouldn't happen if we we

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.730 
this actually wouldn't happen if we we
didn't<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.260> cylinder<00:00:22.260> being<00:00:22.439> used<00:00:22.619> as

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
didn't have this cylinder being used as

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
didn't have this cylinder being used as
a<00:00:22.800> collision<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.850> actually<00:00:23.970> go<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
a collision if we actually go to the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
a collision if we actually go to the
collision<00:00:25.410> operator<00:00:25.650> which<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.430> have

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
collision operator which you see we have

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.689 
collision operator which you see we have
here<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.910> turn<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.150> off<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.400> I'll<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.580> turn

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
here and turn it off and I'll just turn

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
here and turn it off and I'll just turn
off<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.000> gravity<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:30.810> well<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.189> see

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
off this gravity as well and you can see

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.720 
off this gravity as well and you can see
that<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.090> press<00:00:34.020> play<00:00:34.399> you<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.550> see<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that if we press play you can see the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.850 
that if we press play you can see the
particles<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.300> created<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.170> push<00:00:37.829> each

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
particles are created and they push each

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.180 
particles are created and they push each
other<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.500> eventually<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.860> settle

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
other out and eventually they settle

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.979 
other out and eventually they settle
down<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> steady<00:00:41.850> state<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:42.870> we

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
down into a steady state but if we

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.529 
down into a steady state but if we
actually<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.850> keep<00:00:44.850> apart<00:00:45.120> operator

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
actually go to the keep apart operator

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.130 
actually go to the keep apart operator
here<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:47.190> change<00:00:47.539> to<00:00:48.539> absolute<00:00:48.899> size

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
here and we change to absolute size

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.529 
here and we change to absolute size
which<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:51.360> make<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
which you can see we have here we make a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.229 
which you can see we have here we make a
much<00:00:51.750> bigger<00:00:51.989> fall<00:00:52.289> off<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> particles

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
much bigger fall off so the particles

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
much bigger fall off so the particles
will<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:54.510> keep<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.930> pushing<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> basically

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
will now keep on pushing so basically

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
will now keep on pushing so basically
this<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.850> cylinder<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.449> used<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> actually

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this this cylinder was used to actually

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
this this cylinder was used to actually
keep<00:00:58.230> our<00:00:58.379> particles<00:00:58.829> within<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.670> certain<00:00:59.879> area

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
keep our particles within a certain area

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
keep our particles within a certain area
and<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.129> articles

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and you can see there we go up articles

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.030 
and you can see there we go up articles
keep<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.820> pushing<00:01:03.120> outwards<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:06.799> if<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.920> look

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
keep on pushing outwards and if we look

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
keep on pushing outwards and if we look
at<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.490> from<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.850> angle<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> see

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
at it here from this angle you can see

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
at it here from this angle you can see
they're<00:01:10.799> pushing<00:01:11.070> outwards<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.119> after<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
they're pushing outwards and after a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.850 
they're pushing outwards and after a
while<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.590> actually

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
while you know they're all actually

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
while you know they're all actually
birthd<00:01:14.159> originally<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> horizontal

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
birthd originally on on a horizontal

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.039 
birthd originally on on a horizontal
plane<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> gives<00:01:18.450> us<00:01:18.630> an

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
plane and that kind of gives us an

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
plane and that kind of gives us an
artificial<00:01:19.560> result<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.220> respects

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
artificial result in some respects

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
artificial result in some respects
because<00:01:21.320> after<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> certain<00:01:22.560> amount<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.860> well

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
because after a certain amount of well

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
because after a certain amount of well
you<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.340> rounding<00:01:23.700> errors<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> pop<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you get rounding errors to pop in and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.149 
you get rounding errors to pop in and
this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> quite<00:01:25.530> an<00:01:25.590> interesting<00:01:25.770> feature

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this is quite an interesting feature

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
this is quite an interesting feature
actually<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.850> you'll<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.479> after<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
actually and you'll see that after a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually and you'll see that after a
while<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> particle<00:01:28.439> start<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> displace

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
while the particle start to displace

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.740 
while the particle start to displace
each<00:01:29.280> other<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.970> three-dimensional<00:01:30.720> space

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
each other in three-dimensional space

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.499 
each other in three-dimensional space
you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.380> they're<00:01:31.530> pushing<00:01:31.829> each<00:01:31.950> other

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
you can see they're pushing each other

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
you can see they're pushing each other
apart<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.780> three-dimensional<00:01:34.560> space<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
apart in three-dimensional space so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.929 
apart in three-dimensional space so
they're<00:01:35.070> pushing<00:01:35.310> each<00:01:35.400> other<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.729> there

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
they're pushing each other out there

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.530 
they're pushing each other out there
once<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.630> reach<00:01:36.840> their<00:01:38.150> their<00:01:39.150> fall<00:01:39.360> off

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
once they reach their their fall off

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.660 
once they reach their their fall off
zone<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.380> drag<00:01:40.619> operate<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> stops<00:01:41.520> them

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
zone the drag operate that stops them

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.069 
zone the drag operate that stops them
pushing<00:01:41.909> any<00:01:42.150> further<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:42.750> come<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
pushing any further and they come to a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
pushing any further and they come to a
rest<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.119> they're

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
rest so you can see there you go they're

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.609 
rest so you can see there you go they're
pushing<00:01:45.659> each<00:01:45.750> other<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.500> they

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
pushing each other out and then they

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.999 
pushing each other out and then they
come<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> rest<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:49.409> their<00:01:49.890> little

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
come to a rest that in their little

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
come to a rest that in their little
field<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.460> maybe<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.390> bit

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
field so to see it maybe in a little bit

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
field so to see it maybe in a little bit
more<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.200> sort<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> natural<00:01:55.890> environment

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
more of a sort of natural environment

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
more of a sort of natural environment
will<00:01:56.820> create<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> sphere<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.570> our<00:01:58.200> particles

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
will create a sphere and our particles

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
will create a sphere and our particles
will<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.040> born<00:01:59.490> within<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> sphere<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
will now be born within that sphere and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.389 
will now be born within that sphere and
then<00:02:01.079> they'll<00:02:01.229> push<00:02:01.409> each<00:02:01.530> other<00:02:01.710> apart<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
then they'll push each other apart so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.469 
then they'll push each other apart so
they<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.060> they're<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.270> pushing

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
they go you can see they're all pushing

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.719 
they go you can see they're all pushing
each<00:02:03.719> other<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.070> some<00:02:05.070> particles<00:02:05.460> are<00:02:05.549> being

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
each other out some particles are being

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
each other out some particles are being
pushed<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.060> words<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.540> some<00:02:06.689> particles<00:02:07.110> are

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
pushed in words and some particles are

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260 
pushed in words and some particles are
being<00:02:07.380> pushed<00:02:07.560> outwards<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.270> eventually

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
being pushed outwards and eventually

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
being pushed outwards and eventually
again<00:02:09.750> maybe<00:02:09.959> CH<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.440> steady<00:02:11.160> state<00:02:11.489> whether

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
again maybe CH a steady state whether

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.710 
again maybe CH a steady state whether
actually

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.800 
actually
they<00:02:13.350> pretty<00:02:13.590> much<00:02:13.680> come<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.310> stop<00:02:14.660> if<00:02:15.660> we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
they pretty much come to a stop if we

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.880 
they pretty much come to a stop if we
put<00:02:15.990> them<00:02:16.700> inside<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.330> volume<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.830> sphere

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
put them inside the volume of the sphere

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.960 
put them inside the volume of the sphere
and<00:02:20.460> I'll<00:02:20.610> press<00:02:20.820> play<00:02:21.060> again<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.940> see

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and I'll press play again you can see

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.970 
and I'll press play again you can see
again<00:02:24.720> they're<00:02:25.050> pushing<00:02:25.380> apart<00:02:25.500> from<00:02:25.860> each

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
again they're pushing apart from each

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.880 
again they're pushing apart from each
other<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.620> eventually<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:32.070> come<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> rest

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
other and eventually they come to a rest

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.540 
other and eventually they come to a rest
and<00:02:34.890> again<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.430> turn<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.670> our<00:02:35.790> force<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
and again I can turn on our force and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.040 
and again I can turn on our force and
they<00:02:38.550> never<00:02:38.970> actually<00:02:39.120> come<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> complete

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
they never actually come to a complete

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.630 
they never actually come to a complete
rest<00:02:40.410> before<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.890> actual<00:02:40.980> force<00:02:41.340> pops

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
rest before the actual force pops

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.090 
rest before the actual force pops
through<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:42.000> you'll<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.410> again<00:02:43.410> they<00:02:43.890> come

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
through but you'll see again they come

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.290 
through but you'll see again they come
to<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.250> rest<00:02:45.170> pretty<00:02:46.170> much<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:47.940> our<00:02:48.060> force

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
to a rest pretty much and then our force

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.030 
to a rest pretty much and then our force
flight<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.660> only<00:02:48.840> perturbs<00:02:49.290> them<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.590> they

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
flight see only perturbs them and they

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 
flight see only perturbs them and they
fly<00:02:50.280> around<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:50.880> more<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.330> again

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
fly around a little bit more and again

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.990 
fly around a little bit more and again
they<00:02:51.840> come<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> rest<00:02:52.380> again<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:55.580> that's<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
they come to a rest again so that's the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.630 
they come to a rest again so that's the
keeper<00:02:57.930> part<00:02:58.170> operator<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.860> very<00:02:59.070> interesting

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
keeper part operator a very interesting

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.460 
keeper part operator a very interesting
operator<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.600> as<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.870> said<00:03:01.080> if

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
operator because you know as I said if

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.500 
operator because you know as I said if
you<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.800> part<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.310> combine<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.060> number<00:03:03.420> of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
you can part can combine a number of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.740 
you can part can combine a number of
keep<00:03:04.230> apart<00:03:04.500> operators<00:03:05.209> using<00:03:06.209> some<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.660> them

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
keep apart operators using some of them

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.970 
keep apart operators using some of them
with<00:03:08.330> very<00:03:09.330> weak<00:03:09.600> forces<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.470> using<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
with very weak forces you know using a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.530 
with very weak forces you know using a
force<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.340> maybe<00:03:11.550> two<00:03:11.760> or<00:03:11.790> three<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.300> drag

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
force of maybe two or three to drag

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.270 
force of maybe two or three to drag
particles<00:03:13.050> together<00:03:13.200> which<00:03:13.770> is<00:03:13.920> pretty<00:03:14.100> much

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
particles together which is pretty much

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.660 
particles together which is pretty much
our<00:03:14.490> gravity<00:03:14.910> words<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.130> gravity<00:03:17.340> works

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
our gravity words and then gravity works

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.670 
our gravity words and then gravity works
over<00:03:17.910> very<00:03:18.120> long<00:03:18.239> distances<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:19.019> know<00:03:19.140> our

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
over very long distances you know our

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.570 
over very long distances you know our
son<00:03:20.040> has<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> gravitational<00:03:20.670> effect<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.450> us

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
son has a gravitational effect on us

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.780 
son has a gravitational effect on us
then<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:23.940> use<00:03:25.130> very<00:03:26.130> strong<00:03:26.400> forces

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
then you can use very strong forces

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.470 
then you can use very strong forces
values<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.510> say<00:03:27.720> twenty<00:03:28.470> or<00:03:28.830> thirty<00:03:29.330> but<00:03:30.330> with

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
values of say twenty or thirty but with

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.350 
values of say twenty or thirty but with
much<00:03:30.630> smaller<00:03:31.310> core<00:03:32.310> radiuses<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.060> fall<00:03:33.239> off

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
much smaller core radiuses and fall off

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.910 
much smaller core radiuses and fall off
zones<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.110> then<00:03:34.200> act<00:03:34.410> as<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> as<00:03:34.860> a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
zones and that can then act as a as a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520 
zones and that can then act as a as a
more<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.970> magnetic<00:03:36.480> force<00:03:36.720> magnetic

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
more like a magnetic force magnetic

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.590 
more like a magnetic force magnetic
forces<00:03:37.769> are<00:03:37.950> much<00:03:38.100> stronger<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:39.239> they<00:03:39.420> have<00:03:39.570> a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
forces are much stronger but they have a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.030 
forces are much stronger but they have a
much<00:03:41.239> higher<00:03:42.239> fall<00:03:42.810> off<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.739> know<00:03:43.920> if

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
much higher fall off so you know if

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.130 
much higher fall off so you know if
you've<00:03:44.130> got<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> magnet<00:03:44.549> where<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.600> Sun<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.810> is

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
you've got a magnet where the Sun is is

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.449 
you've got a magnet where the Sun is is
not<00:03:46.290> really<00:03:46.530> going<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.860> any<00:03:46.980> effect<00:03:47.070> on

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
not really going to have any effect on

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.330 
not really going to have any effect on
us<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.820> think<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.600> absolute<00:03:48.930> terms<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.130> if

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
us I think in absolute terms you know if

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.940 
us I think in absolute terms you know if
you<00:03:50.459> look<00:03:50.580> at<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:51.450> terms<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.810> physics<00:03:52.170> it's

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
you look at it in terms of physics it's

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.070 
you look at it in terms of physics it's
possible<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.610> magnet<00:03:54.299> next<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> Sun

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
possible that magnet next to the Sun

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.020 
possible that magnet next to the Sun
maybe<00:03:55.709> does<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.130> an<00:03:56.250> effect<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.610> us<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:56.910> it's

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
maybe does have an effect on us but it's

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.660 
maybe does have an effect on us but it's
very<00:03:57.239> very<00:03:57.720> very<00:03:58.080> very<00:03:58.470> very<00:03:58.650> weak<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
very very very very very weak to the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.080 
very very very very very weak to the
point<00:03:59.910> where<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.180> completely<00:04:00.739> unnoticeable

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
point where it's completely unnoticeable

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.720 
point where it's completely unnoticeable
whereas<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.540> Sun<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.310> know<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.519> many

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
whereas the the Sun you know it's many

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.729 
whereas the the Sun you know it's many
millions<00:04:06.060> miles<00:04:06.299> away<00:04:06.630> does<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.560> an<00:04:07.680> effect

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
millions miles away does have an effect

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.570 
millions miles away does have an effect
on<00:04:08.070> us<00:04:08.360> so<00:04:09.890> you've<00:04:10.890> got<00:04:10.920> those<00:04:11.160> two<00:04:11.310> different

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
on us so you've got those two different

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.039 
on us so you've got those two different
forces<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:12.090> think<00:04:12.239> about<00:04:12.450> you've<00:04:12.570> got<00:04:12.720> gravity

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
forces to think about you've got gravity

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.009 
forces to think about you've got gravity
and<00:04:13.380> you've<00:04:13.560> got<00:04:13.910> magnetism<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.900> can

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
and you've got magnetism and you can

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.479 
and you've got magnetism and you can
actually<00:04:16.169> simulate<00:04:16.500> both<00:04:16.830> of<00:04:16.979> those<00:04:17.070> forces

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
actually simulate both of those forces

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.640 
actually simulate both of those forces
by<00:04:17.729> using<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.120> keeper<00:04:18.390> part<00:04:18.600> operator<00:04:19.019> by

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
by using the keeper part operator by

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.070 
by using the keeper part operator by
they're<00:04:19.890> using<00:04:20.220> weak<00:04:20.660> forces<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.870> great

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
they're using weak forces of a great

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.860 
they're using weak forces of a great
ranges<00:04:22.500> gravity<00:04:23.070> or<00:04:23.250> using<00:04:24.000> strong<00:04:24.270> forces<00:04:24.660> of

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
ranges gravity or using strong forces of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.280 
ranges gravity or using strong forces of
a<00:04:24.960> very<00:04:25.289> short<00:04:25.560> distances

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
a very short distances

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.610 
a very short distances
you<00:04:26.440> have<00:04:26.740> with<00:04:27.400> magnetism<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.290> then<00:04:29.290> you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
you have with magnetism and then you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
you have with magnetism and then you
know<00:04:29.740> you've<00:04:29.920> got<00:04:29.950> more<00:04:30.250> control<00:04:30.610> over

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
know you've got more control over

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.080 
know you've got more control over
exactly<00:04:31.060> how<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.840> force<00:04:32.320> field<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.710> actually

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
exactly how that force field is actually

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.040 
exactly how that force field is actually
implemented<00:04:34.090> in<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.270> scene<00:04:34.480> whether<00:04:34.690> it's<00:04:34.870> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
implemented in the scene whether it's a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.550 
implemented in the scene whether it's a
it's<00:04:35.620> got<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> very<00:04:35.950> hard<00:04:36.580> center<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.560> within

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
it's got a very hard center to it within

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.500 
it's got a very hard center to it within
which<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.010> know<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.190> get<00:04:39.820> then<00:04:40.030> particles

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
which you know you get then particles

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.030 
which you know you get then particles
bouncing<00:04:40.900> off<00:04:41.020> each<00:04:41.050> other<00:04:41.380> almost<00:04:41.680> as<00:04:41.920> if

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
bouncing off each other almost as if

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.530 
bouncing off each other almost as if
they've<00:04:42.190> got<00:04:42.370> some<00:04:42.580> sort<00:04:42.610> of<00:04:42.850> solid<00:04:43.180> mass<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
they've got some sort of solid mass to

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.690 
they've got some sort of solid mass to
them<00:04:43.660> or<00:04:44.230> you<00:04:44.590> can<00:04:44.710> make<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:45.040> particles<00:04:45.490> into

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
them or you can make the particles into

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.760 
them or you can make the particles into
like<00:04:46.030> much<00:04:46.300> much<00:04:46.750> larger<00:04:46.900> fields<00:04:47.470> which<00:04:47.620> we're

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
like much much larger fields which we're

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.740 
like much much larger fields which we're
actually<00:04:47.890> doing<00:04:48.160> here<00:04:48.460> in<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.670> example<00:04:49.060> so

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
actually doing here in this example so

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.110 
actually doing here in this example so
you<00:04:49.810> know<00:04:50.050> if<00:04:50.140> I<00:04:50.230> do<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.710> fall<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.310> range<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.700> 20

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
you know if I do a fall of range of 20

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.760 
you know if I do a fall of range of 20
you<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.720> see<00:04:52.810> our<00:04:52.930> particles<00:04:53.380> will<00:04:53.470> just<00:04:53.650> keep

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
you can see our particles will just keep

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.550 
you can see our particles will just keep
on<00:04:53.950> pushing<00:04:54.250> against<00:04:54.610> each<00:04:54.670> other<00:04:55.380> they<00:04:56.380> just

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
on pushing against each other they just

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.780 
on pushing against each other they just
keep<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.830> pushing<00:04:57.130> out<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.460> out<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.700> out

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
keep on pushing out and out and out

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.190 
keep on pushing out and out and out
because<00:04:58.180> they've<00:04:58.360> got<00:04:58.480> this<00:04:58.600> massive<00:04:58.810> fall

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
because they've got this massive fall

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080 
because they've got this massive fall
off<00:04:59.350> zone<00:04:59.590> so<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.070> force<00:05:00.280> can<00:05:00.490> have<00:05:00.610> efecto<00:05:01.030> to

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
off zone so the force can have efecto to

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.030 
off zone so the force can have efecto to
a<00:05:01.210> very<00:05:01.660> large<00:05:01.810> distance<00:05:03.480> so<00:05:04.800> that's<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:06.010> for

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
a very large distance so that's it for

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.460 
a very large distance so that's it for
the<00:05:06.340> keep<00:05:07.150> apart<00:05:07.390> operator<00:05:07.780> have<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.260> go<00:05:08.440> with

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
the keep apart operator have a go with

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.040 
the keep apart operator have a go with
it<00:05:08.710> have<00:05:08.920> a<00:05:08.950> go<00:05:09.310> with<00:05:09.460> our<00:05:09.580> example<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.360> try

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
it have a go with our example and try

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.290 
it have a go with our example and try
out<00:05:11.170> different<00:05:11.290> options<00:05:11.740> with<00:05:11.920> it<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:12.300> you'll

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
out different options with it and you'll

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.430 
out different options with it and you'll
actually<00:05:13.450> see<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:13.930> know<00:05:14.050> it's<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.260> very

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
actually see you know it's a very

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.850 
actually see you know it's a very
interesting<00:05:14.560> operator<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:16.240> can<00:05:16.360> do<00:05:16.480> lots<00:05:16.660> of

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
interesting operator you can do lots of

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.060 
interesting operator you can do lots of
different<00:05:17.860> results<00:05:18.850> and<00:05:19.360> effects<00:05:19.720> with<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:20.070> so

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
different results and effects with it so

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.800 
different results and effects with it so
it's<00:05:21.100> well<00:05:21.340> worth<00:05:21.550> trying<00:05:22.150> out<00:05:22.270> some<00:05:22.630> of<00:05:22.720> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
it's well worth trying out some of the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.810 
it's well worth trying out some of the
effects<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.710> can<00:05:23.890> you<00:05:24.340> can<00:05:24.490> get<00:05:24.640> with<00:05:24.790> it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
effects that you can you can get with it

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.390 
effects that you can you can get with it
you<00:05:25.630> know<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:25.840> really<00:05:25.960> does<00:05:26.200> bear<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.740> lot<00:05:27.220> of

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
you know it really does bear a lot of

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.970 
you know it really does bear a lot of
experimentation<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:29.110> can<00:05:29.290> see<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.620> know<00:05:29.710> in

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
experimentation you can see you know in

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.350 
experimentation you can see you know in
this<00:05:30.100> particular<00:05:30.250> case<00:05:30.640> I've<00:05:30.850> used<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.180> very

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
this particular case I've used a very

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.240 
this particular case I've used a very
particular<00:05:31.570> orientation<00:05:32.140> using<00:05:33.130> this

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
particular orientation using this

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.470 
particular orientation using this
collision<00:05:34.090> cylinder<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.670> using<00:05:36.670> forces<00:05:37.240> and

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
collision cylinder and using forces and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.480 
collision cylinder and using forces and
you<00:05:37.930> get<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.200> very<00:05:38.380> interesting<00:05:38.950> results<00:05:39.340> with

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
you get in very interesting results with

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.750 
you get in very interesting results with
it<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:40.570> can<00:05:40.720> try<00:05:41.050> doing<00:05:41.350> similar<00:05:42.250> things<00:05:42.370> with

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
it you can try doing similar things with

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.970 
it you can try doing similar things with
particles<00:05:43.420> inside<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.720> volume<00:05:44.170> and<00:05:44.350> have<00:05:44.830> them

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
particles inside a volume and have them

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.540 
particles inside a volume and have them
pushing<00:05:45.220> off<00:05:45.460> each<00:05:45.610> other<00:05:45.820> with<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.260> negative

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
pushing off each other with a negative

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.280 
pushing off each other with a negative
with<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.580> positive<00:05:49.000> force<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.570> then<00:05:50.080> you<00:05:50.170> can

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
with a positive force and then you can

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.800 
with a positive force and then you can
have<00:05:50.850> weaker<00:05:51.850> forces<00:05:52.240> pulling<00:05:52.480> them<00:05:52.660> together

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
have weaker forces pulling them together

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.380 
have weaker forces pulling them together
and<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.320> can<00:05:54.100> try<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.610> know<00:05:54.730> simulating

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
and you can try you know simulating

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.430 
and you can try you know simulating
clouds<00:05:56.050> of<00:05:56.230> gas<00:05:56.520> by<00:05:57.520> using<00:05:57.730> this<00:05:57.970> particular

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
clouds of gas by using this particular

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.420 
clouds of gas by using this particular
operator<00:05:59.440> so<00:05:59.740> it's<00:06:00.070> a<00:06:00.130> very<00:06:00.310> interesting

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
operator so it's a very interesting

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.670 
operator so it's a very interesting
operator<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.210> well<00:06:01.360> worth<00:06:01.680> experimenting

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
operator and well worth experimenting

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.100 
operator and well worth experimenting
