00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
at that we still have 19 coins so I

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.729 
at that we still have 19 coins so I
think<00:04:09.569> we<00:04:09.780> should<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.019> play<00:04:10.290> one<00:04:10.530> more<00:04:10.680> game

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
think we should just play one more game
