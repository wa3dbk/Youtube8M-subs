00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
I think it's this area of mixing

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.770 
I think it's this area of mixing
chemistry<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.790> biology<00:01:52.939> together<00:01:53.420> and

chemistry and biology together and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.149 
chemistry and biology together and
bringing<00:01:54.140> them<00:01:54.229> more<00:01:54.469> more<00:01:54.649> closely<00:01:54.890> together

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
bringing them more more closely together

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.730 
bringing them more more closely together
is<00:01:55.490> an<00:01:56.000> exciting<00:01:56.540> development<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:57.380> which<00:01:57.590> we

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
is an exciting development of which we

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.709 
is an exciting development of which we
see<00:01:57.950> many<00:01:58.159> examples<00:01:58.310> all<00:01:59.000> over<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.360> world<00:01:59.479> and

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
see many examples all over the world and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.690 
see many examples all over the world and
especially<00:01:59.810> also<00:02:00.380> i<00:02:00.439> think<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.829> europe<00:02:01.100> this

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
especially also i think in europe this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.370 
especially also i think in europe this
field<00:02:01.939> of<00:02:02.030> chemical<00:02:02.479> biology<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.020> moving

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
field of chemical biology is moving

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.440 
field of chemical biology is moving
forward<00:02:03.619> very<00:02:03.979> quickly<00:02:04.149> what<00:02:05.149> we<00:02:05.270> hope<00:02:05.390> to

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
forward very quickly what we hope to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.270 
forward very quickly what we hope to
achieve<00:02:05.570> with<00:02:06.049> our<00:02:06.200> systems<00:02:06.649> for<00:02:06.860> example<00:02:07.219> is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
achieve with our systems for example is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.550 
achieve with our systems for example is
really<00:02:07.579> to<00:02:07.729> also<00:02:08.090> go<00:02:08.630> much<00:02:08.869> more<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> field

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
really to also go much more in the field

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.530 
really to also go much more in the field
of<00:02:09.770> biology<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.820> see<00:02:10.970> if<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.210> can<00:02:11.360> bring

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
of biology to see if you can bring

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.810 
of biology to see if you can bring
chemistry<00:02:12.050> closer<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.650> biology<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.730> to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
chemistry closer to biology and to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.710 
chemistry closer to biology and to
integrate<00:02:14.270> these<00:02:14.810> two<00:02:15.050> disciplines

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
integrate these two disciplines

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
integrate these two disciplines
further<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:17.220> sure<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
further and for sure I think that this

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.790 
further and for sure I think that this
will<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.600> exciting<00:02:18.840> development<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
will be an exciting development for the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.130 
will be an exciting development for the
next<00:02:20.070> decades<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.640> material<00:02:21.570> science<00:02:21.600> but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
next decades in material science but

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.870 
next decades in material science but
also<00:02:22.260> extending<00:02:22.830> very<00:02:23.130> nicely<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.670> life

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
also extending very nicely to life

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.930 
also extending very nicely to life
sciences<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.480> chemistry
