00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.400
Ever tell you how The Kid got himself wrapped up in this mess to begin with?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.300
Not every kid's born bad.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.570
Fair to say he's led a hard life...

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.479
supposin' what he says in his sleep ain't
no lie.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.040
All The Kid had to work with was his hammer and the clothes on his back.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.370
Lady: This pendant would look lovely on my sister-

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Stabby: The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.030
Lady: Noooough!

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.410
Guy: Never shoulda come here!

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.579
People (together): I cannot best you!

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.340
He never knew his folks.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.440
Plague took 'em.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.100
Grelod: None of you riff raff is getting adopted
EVER!

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Grelod: Nobody needs you. Nobody wants you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.779
The city had nothin' for him.

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:59.310
Kid learned to fend for himself.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.059
Took to stealin' from a missionary living
there.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.439
Missionary: That's close enough.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.600
The security takes him for a petty thief.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.890
Riften Guard: You have committed crimes against
Skyrim and her people.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.419
Riften Guard: What say you in your defense?

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:15.400
Must've been guardin' that shrine.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.800
Riften Guard: I guess you're smarter than
you look.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.350
Folks who fouled up would do their time here.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.000
All Kid can do... is wait.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.300
Well, if the gods are alive, they must be
plenty sore.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.500
Guard: Alright, there gonna... 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800
you're gonna...

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800
get executed.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.000
Kid ain't the only one.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Ralof: EEEP!

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.790
Ralof: This is Helgen.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.090
Ralof: I used to be sweet on a girl from here.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.310
Ralof: I wonder if V. Lard is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:03.000
Ralof: Funny. When I was a boy, the Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.560
Boy: Who are they, Daddy?  Where are they going?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.200
Kid hasn't a clue.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.840
Father: You need to go inside, little tub.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.939
Boy: Why?  I wanna watch the soldiers.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.000
Not like this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
Father: Inside the house. Now.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.879
Donkey Puller: Whoa!

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.000
Boy: Yes, papa.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.000
Skank: Get these prisoners out of the carts.  Move it!

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.000
Lokir: Why are we stopping?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.560
Ralof: Why do you think? End of the line.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
Now he lands at the intersection between bad and wrong.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.740
Ralof: Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.769
He gets up.

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.400
Lokir: No! Wait! We're not rebels!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.590
Ralof: Face your death with some courage, thief.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.530
Lokir: You've got to tell them, weren't with you!

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.970
Lokir: This is a mistake!

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.050
Skank: Step towards the block when we call your names. One at a time!

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.550
Ralof: *sigh* Empire loves their damn lists.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.920
Hadvar: Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Windhelm.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.200
Ralof: It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.880
Hadvar: Ralof of Riverwood.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.120
And there he is...

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.240
The Arm of Justice.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.540
Hadvar: Lokir of Rorikstead.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.270
Lokir: No, I'm not a rebel! You can't do this!

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.760
Some folks wound up taking the coward's way out.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.760
Skank: Halt!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.330
Lokir: You're not gonna kill me!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.990
Skank: Archers!

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.000
Lokir: Yarg!

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.819
Skank: Anyone else feel like running?

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.709
No ma'am.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.360
Hadvar: Wait. You there. Step forward.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.569
Kid had little choice.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.890
Hadvar: Who are you?

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.500
*SMOOCH!*

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.540
Well, now it's personal.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.000
Hadvar: You fum Daggerfall, Breton?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.569
NO!

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.330
Hadvar: Fleeing from some court intrigue?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.419
Not entirely.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.019
Hadvar: Captain, what should we do? He's not on the list.

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.910
Captain Skank: Forget the list. He goes to the block.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.280
Hadvar: By your orders, Captain.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.819
Hadvar: I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.860
Hadvar: Follow the cat pen, prisoner.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.680
Tullius: Ulfric Stormcloak, some here in Helgen
call you a hero.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.200
Tullius: But a hero doesn't use a power like The Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.229
Tullius: You started this war! Plunged Skyrim into chaos!

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.240
Tullius: And now The Empire is going to PUT YOU DOWN *breathes in* and restore the peace!

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.029
Ulfric's a talkative sort.

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.100
Least he used to be.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.870
*whale noises*

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.590
Hadvar: What was that?

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.620
Kid's wonderin' the same thing.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.100
Tullius: It's nothing. Carry on.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.840
Skank: Yes, General Tullius. Give them their Last Rites.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.210
Missionary: As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. (interrupted)

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.669
Mr. Smug: For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.830
Missionary: Our... as you wish.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.850
He ain't big on small talk.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.260
Smuggy: Come on! I haven't got all morning!

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.000
Well, no point explainin' what happens next... right?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.610
Smuggy: My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials.  Can you say the same?

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.680
And just like that...

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.850
Didn't make it.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.430
I'd like to say I'll never forget 'im.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.100
Well, what does it matter...

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.820
Skank: Next! The Breton!

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.560
Then Kid gets the feelin' he's being watched.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.560
*sexy whale noises*

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.660
Hadvar: There it is again. Did you hear that?

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.240
Skank: I said... next... PRISONER!

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.970
Hadvar: To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.619
Random Lady: You Imperial bastards!

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.200
Kid does what he has to do.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.899
*FOOMP!*

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:53.500
Surprised Guard: What in Oblivion is that?!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.000
*WORMP*

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.040
They used to think dragons were extinct.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.940
Skank: Sentries, what do you see?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.030
Well...

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.110
They ain't.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.779
Some Lady: DRAGON!!

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.880
One of them's been living in the tall grass.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.280
Dragon: YEAH!!!

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.100
And then...

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.799
Executioner: Huag!

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:20.600
He falls to his death.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.000
Old Man: Guards! Get these townspeople to
*dies*

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.319
Kid ain't about to pass out in the middle of the fight.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.970
Guard: By Ysmir, nothing kills it!

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.750
It's a troublesome scene to be sure.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.000
*rabble rabble*

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.900
Ralof: This way!

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.760
They never saw him comin'.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.200
Not that it matters anymore.
