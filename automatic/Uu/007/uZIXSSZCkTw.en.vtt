because<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.520> couldn't<00:02:45.819> have<00:02:45.910> gotten<00:02:46.120> this

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
because you couldn't have gotten this

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.480 
because you couldn't have gotten this

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
game also has four different levels you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.140 
game also has four different levels you
have<00:02:53.080> novice<00:02:53.560> intermediate<00:02:53.770> advanced<00:02:54.640> expert

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
have novice intermediate advanced expert

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.120 
have novice intermediate advanced expert
and<00:02:55.390> there's<00:02:56.140> also<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.380> challenge<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.950> actually

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
and there's also a challenge I actually

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.920 
and there's also a challenge I actually
forget<00:02:57.580> what<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.849> challenge<00:02:58.240> level<00:02:58.540> was<00:02:58.780> all

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
forget what the challenge level was all

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.510 
forget what the challenge level was all
about<00:02:59.170> but<00:02:59.470> but<00:02:59.950> I'm<00:03:00.040> playing<00:03:00.340> on<00:03:00.490> the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
about but but I'm playing on the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.100 
about but but I'm playing on the
intermediate<00:03:01.180> level<00:03:01.209> here<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.050> could

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
intermediate level here just so I could

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.530 
intermediate level here just so I could
rock<00:03:02.410> through<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.890> game<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.520> as<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.180> said<00:03:04.240> in

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
rock through the game and as I said in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.750 
rock through the game and as I said in
some<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.140> previous<00:03:05.350> reviews<00:03:06.130> on<00:03:06.280> Robotron

2084

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.170 
2084
think<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.350> one<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.710> most<00:03:08.860> difficult

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
think this is one of the most difficult

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.570 
think this is one of the most difficult
challenging<00:03:10.180> games<00:03:10.450> ever<00:03:11.050> made<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.400> an

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
challenging games ever made and as an

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.070 
challenging games ever made and as an
arcade<00:03:12.940> game<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.540> brilliant<00:03:13.990> because

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
arcade game this is brilliant because

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080 
arcade game this is brilliant because
this<00:03:14.410> must<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.800> eaten<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.460> many<00:03:15.580> quarters

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
this must have eaten so many quarters

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.820 
this must have eaten so many quarters
from<00:03:16.180> people<00:03:16.540> who<00:03:16.690> play<00:03:16.930> these<00:03:17.140> quick

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
from people who play these quick

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.790 
from people who play these quick
Robotron<00:03:18.400> 2084<00:03:18.640> games<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.840> kept<00:03:20.320> coming<00:03:20.470> back

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
Robotron 2084 games and kept coming back

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.650 
Robotron 2084 games and kept coming back
for<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.190> because<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:21.670> was<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:21.970> much<00:03:22.120> fun

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
for more because it was so much fun

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.560 
for more because it was so much fun
and<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.770> intermediate<00:03:24.040> gameplay<00:03:24.910> mode<00:03:25.180> here

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
and the intermediate gameplay mode here

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.020 
and the intermediate gameplay mode here
the<00:03:26.200> enemies<00:03:26.530> come<00:03:26.710> at<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> bit<00:03:27.280> slower<00:03:27.670> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the enemies come at you a bit slower the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.420 
the enemies come at you a bit slower the
tanks<00:03:28.420> don't<00:03:28.570> spawn<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.170> quickly<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.860> it's

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
tanks don't spawn as quickly and it's

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.130 
tanks don't spawn as quickly and it's
pretty<00:03:30.670> easy<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.970> wipe<00:03:31.240> out<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.600> brains<00:03:31.900> on

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
pretty easy to wipe out the brains on

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.660 
pretty easy to wipe out the brains on
the<00:03:32.170> brain<00:03:32.440> levels<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.070> then<00:03:33.160> collect<00:03:33.490> all

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the brain levels and then collect all

the brain levels and then collect all
the<00:03:33.760> humans<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.660> get<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> lot<00:03:34.960> more<00:03:34.990> extra

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
left hand and then the Atari 7800

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.040 
left hand and then the Atari 7800
controller<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.490> my<00:04:33.730> right<00:04:33.940> hand<00:04:34.150> which<00:04:34.450> which

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
controller in my right hand which which

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.540 
controller in my right hand which which
was<00:04:35.230> pretty<00:04:35.470> big<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:36.010> mean<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.250> thing<00:04:36.460> is

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
was pretty big I mean this thing is

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.280 
was pretty big I mean this thing is
actually<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.880> very<00:04:37.090> difficult<00:04:37.240> controller<00:04:38.080> to

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
actually a very difficult controller to

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.500 
actually a very difficult controller to
use<00:04:38.410> with<00:04:38.560> one<00:04:38.740> hand<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.520> only<00:04:40.000> remember<00:04:40.390> how

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
use with one hand so I only remember how

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.660 
use with one hand so I only remember how
I<00:04:40.540> did<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.870> when<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.110> was<00:04:41.140> a<00:04:41.260> kid<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:42.370> once<00:04:42.580> you

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
I did this when I was a kid but once you

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.280 
I did this when I was a kid but once you
get<00:04:42.790> over<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.060> awkwardness<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.780> playing<00:04:44.080> with

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
get over the awkwardness of playing with

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.230 
get over the awkwardness of playing with
two<00:04:44.470> controllers

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
two controllers

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.820 
two controllers
this<00:04:46.240> is<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.420> good<00:04:46.660> version<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:47.110> Robotron<00:04:47.620> 2084

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
this is a good version of Robotron 2084

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.430 
this is a good version of Robotron 2084
and<00:04:48.760> worth<00:04:49.120> checking<00:04:49.480> out<00:04:49.750> if<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.080> have<00:04:50.260> the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and worth checking out if you have the

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.010 
and worth checking out if you have the
old<00:04:50.590> Atari<00:04:50.920> console<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.850> like<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.720> get<00:04:52.870> back

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
old Atari console and like to get back

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.290 
old Atari console and like to get back
into<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.440> old<00:04:53.560> Atari<00:04:53.860> games<00:04:54.250> also<00:04:54.790> as<00:04:55.210> I

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
into the old Atari games also as I

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.180 
into the old Atari games also as I
mentioned<00:04:55.660> it's<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.840> good<00:04:56.080> bit<00:04:56.290> easier<00:04:56.830> than

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
mentioned it's a good bit easier than

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.600 
mentioned it's a good bit easier than
the<00:04:57.310> standard<00:04:57.820> versions<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.690> Robotron<00:04:59.140> 2084

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
the standard versions of Robotron 2084

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.830 
the standard versions of Robotron 2084
so<00:05:00.610> if<00:05:00.700> you're<00:05:00.820> just<00:05:00.850> starting<00:05:01.210> out<00:05:01.510> with<00:05:01.690> the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
so if you're just starting out with the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.840 
so if you're just starting out with the
game<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.320> want<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.560> practice<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.670> might

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
game and you want to practice this might

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.900 
game and you want to practice this might
be<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.030> great<00:05:04.300> version<00:05:04.510> to<00:05:04.750> do<00:05:04.930> that<00:05:05.110> on<00:05:05.910> the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
be a great version to do that on the

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.290 
be a great version to do that on the
Atari<00:05:07.300> 7800<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.530> built<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.640> tank

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
Atari 7800 is built like a tank

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.810 
Atari 7800 is built like a tank
so<00:05:10.480> I<00:05:10.510> thoroughly<00:05:11.200> expect<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:11.950> game<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.370> also

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
so I thoroughly expect this game to also

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.800 
so I thoroughly expect this game to also
continue<00:05:13.210> working<00:05:13.690> in<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.920> year<00:05:15.210> 2080<00:05:16.210> for<00:05:16.540> I

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
continue working in the year 2080 for I

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.659 
continue working in the year 2080 for I
