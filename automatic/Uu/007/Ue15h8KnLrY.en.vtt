00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 and hello to you ermine today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.630
 we play mine a beautiful day i will 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.700
 small review 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 armor added industrial craft 2 this 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.330
 I will explain quantum armor step by step 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.300
 what privileges they add she 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 adds and so quantum scolded anger 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.529
 can only be hon in no more 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.529
 energy storage it will not charge 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 so let's start slam 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:49.890
 Helmet Kraft it here and so on to the helmet 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 2 and rubber plates and glavfatron 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 2 improved chips and armored 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.449
 glass turns out a quantum helmet than it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 advantages its advantage is that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 when you are underwater at depth 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.409
 2 blocks or more you have no oxygen 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.729
 ends it comes to four 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.360
 bubbles and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.490
 it is important to renew anew just 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.770
 can it waste oxygen dirt 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:30.570
 Illuminate the helmet also throughout the video 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 you will notice that I have in the inventory are 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 canned helmet will automatically me 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.470
 feed leaving my strip 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 eating such he can do only with 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.520
 canned food 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.470
 big with anything finished with a helmet 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:55.200
 let's go quantum bib y 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.140
 to paint it here is what nano armor on 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 vest 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.790
 three fortified words 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:10.720
 4 and zealous plate is the most difficult 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:13.690
 from the crater than its advantages 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.110
 the advantage in him is one he protects you 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.140
 70 percent the remaining thirty 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.430
 percent are divided among themselves quantum 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.959
 strain socks 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.950
 pants and helmet look i 'm leaving low and have 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.250
 I did not spend even people heart 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.590
 all if it takes over 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:45.430
 quantum bib charge is also spent 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.510
 and everyone else they suddenly have you 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.140
 only 10 percent 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.650
 basic protection takes on a quantum 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.980
 on piles on this its advantages 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.980
 run out 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.269
 The following type of armor is quantum pants 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:11.310
 their advantage is that if we click 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.310
 twice on w 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.290
 where do you go 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.760
 we will run very fast for a very 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.269
 you can quickly feel yourself 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.890
 superhero 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:33.940
 quickly linen well this and all that they 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:36.250
 run and quantum socks or shoes 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.720
 or you can only want so 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:44.890
 call them an advantage in that 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.540
 holding the default counter and the space can 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.540
 very high jump and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.209
 it is quite useful and cool 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.109
 can you feel any 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.650
 superhero if all this combine it 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.340
 at all 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:11.349
 and the pier on the run jump adds a lot 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:15.340
 useful features well on this our 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:20.639
 review check came to an end good luck 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.639

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.639
