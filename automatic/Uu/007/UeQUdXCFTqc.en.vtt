00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
welcome to this tutorial and using

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.100 
welcome to this tutorial and using
AutoCAD<00:00:11.120> to<00:00:11.690> draw<00:00:11.930> a<00:00:12.200> site's<00:00:12.710> title<00:00:13.549> boundary

so the first thing we need to do is set

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.650 
so the first thing we need to do is set
the<00:00:17.000> units<00:00:17.420> for<00:00:18.260> how<00:00:18.380> we<00:00:18.440> work<00:00:18.730> so<00:00:19.730> type<00:00:19.940> UN

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
the units for how we work so type UN

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.079 
the units for how we work so type UN
with<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.560> command<00:00:21.800> prompt<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.310> press<00:00:22.400> space

firstly<00:00:30.679> is<00:00:31.220> choose<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:31.519> unit's<00:00:31.939> we're<00:00:32.090> gonna

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
firstly is choose the unit's we're gonna

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.360 
firstly is choose the unit's we're gonna
be<00:00:32.270> working<00:00:32.540> in<00:00:32.599> I'm<00:00:33.440> going<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.829> be<00:00:33.920> working<00:00:34.250> in

need to do is click on clockwise so we

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.130 
need to do is click on clockwise so we
know<00:00:42.140> it's<00:00:42.790> rotation<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.450> degrees

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
know it's rotation that the degrees

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.130 
know it's rotation that the degrees
minutes<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.470> seconds<00:00:45.800> go<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.990> click<00:00:47.990> on

minutes and seconds go and click on
direction<00:00:48.500> now<00:00:49.370> we<00:00:49.580> need<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.820> change<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.420> to

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
direction now we need to change it to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.130 
direction now we need to change it to
north<00:00:51.370> there's<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.430> click<00:00:52.580> ok<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.540> ok

basically what that just did was North
us<00:00:57.530> now<00:00:58.120> facing<00:00:59.120> zero<00:00:59.600> degrees<00:01:00.070> East<00:01:01.070> is<00:01:01.280> 90

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
us now facing zero degrees East is 90

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.950 
us now facing zero degrees East is 90
South<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.540> 180<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.320> West<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.840> 272<00:01:05.840> bit

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
South is 180 and West is 272 bit

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.780 
South is 180 and West is 272 bit
misleading<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.530> window<00:01:06.830> but<00:01:07.100> that's<00:01:07.610> how

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
we look at the first dimension it's

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.850 
we look at the first dimension it's
thirteen<00:02:31.519> point<00:02:31.730> five<00:02:31.880> four<00:02:32.120> meters<00:02:32.510> at<00:02:33.500> six
