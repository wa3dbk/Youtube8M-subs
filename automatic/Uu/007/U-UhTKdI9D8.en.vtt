00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.759
 hello how about butt 7 hours good we're going to 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.709
 give a little explanation to the new 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.949
 change that got the eve rick and marc 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:15.590
 good guasch also known in gifted 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.630
 in the latest version that is 6.82 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.060
 well we realize that they have 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 exchanged what their 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.050
 skills ultimate your skill became a 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
 last and last and it happened to be a 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.160
 corner now we have the invisibility to 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.480
 level 1 was going to be an invisibility 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.180
 permanent is like it's the last 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.309
 year of 1 we see that we activate it and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.550
 Our r is going to get what's coming 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.379
 being 8 seconds in its first level 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.140
 to be able to become a hero 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.659
 invisible and there we are already seeing that 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.069
 that invisible and can not be what has it 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.289
 being detected by no unit 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:54.440
 enemy unless they have some kind 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:57.079
 of good detection object which is what 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.690
 good of your last and good your last 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.469
 consists of what a limit has been 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.750
 either three four or five jumps and 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.970
 each of them will cause a bonus 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 of damage is the same as its corner 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 above only that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.520
 to be multiplied by what comes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 doing some series of charge bonds 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.090
 always and then we go there we go to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.090
 give it then level 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.220
 lounge and the 25 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.770
 good before 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.260
 and what has been beginning to show 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.560
 the jumps one of the advantages of his 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.810
 skill then is that previously what 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.510
 it's being invisibility or good 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 get the hero had a problem and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.760
 it was the regeneration of life then 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.920
 some voted to create the boots of 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.170
 agile and the boots of tranquility I'm 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.530
 here the greens to get a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.990
 regeneration or some choose to come 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.360
 to go hunting etc. the advantage of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 the latter is that forgiveness of this skiles 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.979
 that now possess regeneration of life what 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.990
 we have in 4 5 6 or 7 depending on the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.890
 level that we have it maximum 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.310
 then if we realize to lower a 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 little life 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.810
 and well here we have a regeneration of 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.730
 434 and we see that it is regenerating 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.980
 life in six for being a hero because 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.780
 have an accumulation of force if 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.420
 we put the body boots we are going to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 have six points 0 4 for each point of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.140
 force let's get feedback from 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.450
 life one kilo more 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.550
 so then if you max the aa level 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.069
 level 4 we will get a more relationship 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.650
 fast and we're going to raze the life the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.660
 in itself the first level as it does not vary 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.569
 it's still a cloud that is going to 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:02.540
 mute the units you see from 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:04.250
 she can not be any more and if she is supposed to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.019
 says that there are five jumps that I owe 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.019
 give it then let's count the one 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.430
 well here we have 3 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.100
 we have made three jumps and a maximum of 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.890
 Allowed loads are signs 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.040
 and here what would be is waiting 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.360
 to let the charges go 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.360
 let's refresh it 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.000
 offered profession 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.740
 we have to wait for him to load us 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.870
 here in this bar what will appear 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.510
 comes the charges of the jumps ok 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.000
 this is similar as the ultimate of the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.160
 remnants of denver spirit that each 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.750
 remnant that we leave and if it reaches us 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.790
 to exhaust then a 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 bar here charging saying some 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.780
 how many remnants are we 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 in this space is not saying how many 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.430
 We will be able to do jumps in 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.050
 this precise moment is here he says to you 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.850
 that we are only going to be able to make one 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.850
 let's wait a moment for what 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.800
 to see two highs then one 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.709
 mind that I do not have jumps anymore 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.109
 what to expect, we have to wait for 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.970
 complete the and the five jumps 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.530
 about and well this would have been the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.070
 purpose of this video somewhat 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.930
 explanatory for what has been 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.020
 well you are not but the new 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.880
 modifications of the ricky hero and that's it 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.669
 see you then in the next video 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.669
 of high dota for the youtube channel
