you<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.159> need<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.430> anyway<00:01:59.969> oh<00:02:00.290> my<00:02:01.290> god<00:02:01.619> yeah

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you don't need it anyway oh my god yeah

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.959 
you don't need it anyway oh my god yeah
so<00:02:02.570> honestly<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.860> setup<00:02:05.700> with

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
so honestly I think with this setup with

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
so honestly I think with this setup with
this<00:02:06.390> equipment

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this equipment

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.790 
this equipment
co-op<00:02:08.369> four-player<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.960> sky's<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.290> limit<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
co-op four-player the sky's the limit I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.980 
co-op four-player the sky's the limit I
mean<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.100> limit<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:11.940> round<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.570> can<00:02:12.780> get

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
mean the limit on what round you can get

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.040 
mean the limit on what round you can get
to<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.970> dictated<00:02:14.970> by<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.180> amount<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.690> time<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
to is dictated by the amount of time you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.500 
to is dictated by the amount of time you
have<00:02:16.080> period<00:02:16.860> or<00:02:17.280> your<00:02:17.640> internet<00:02:17.910> connection

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
have period or your internet connection

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.290 
have period or your internet connection
or<00:02:18.630> your<00:02:18.980> Xbox<00:02:19.980> overheating<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.030> whatever

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
or your Xbox overheating or whatever

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.980 
or your Xbox overheating or whatever

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.270 
you're playing on you're almost it's
almost<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> you're<00:02:25.560> invisible<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.040> mean<00:02:26.190> add

whatever round you want and and you know
I<00:03:02.760> don't<00:03:03.210> think<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.570> least<00:03:03.810> co-op<00:03:04.410> we're

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
I don't think at least co-op we're

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.380 
I don't think at least co-op we're
really<00:03:05.220> interested<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.730> doing<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.030> because

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
really interested in doing that because

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.840 
really interested in doing that because
of<00:03:06.570> our<00:03:06.690> time<00:03:07.200> schedules<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.520> fact<00:03:08.760> that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
of our time schedules and the fact that

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.640 
of our time schedules and the fact that
we're<00:03:09.030> playing<00:03:09.150> over<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> Internet<00:03:09.780> solo<00:03:10.320> I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
we're playing over the Internet solo I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.490 
we're playing over the Internet solo I
mean<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.880> even<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.600> easier<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.200> it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
mean it's not even it's easier it's it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.530 
mean it's not even it's easier it's it
almost<00:03:13.890> seems<00:03:14.130> easier<00:03:14.489> than<00:03:14.700> an<00:03:15.000> ascension

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
almost seems easier than an ascension

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.890 
almost seems easier than an ascension
running<00:03:16.470> solo<00:03:17.220> with<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.120> type<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.540> weaponry

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
running solo with this type of weaponry

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.790 
running solo with this type of weaponry
I<00:03:20.270> don't<00:03:21.270> know<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.200> pretty<00:03:22.410> good<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:22.770> I

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
I don't know it's it's pretty good but I

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.979 
I don't know it's it's pretty good but I
think<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.790> had<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.780> discussion

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
think you know I had this discussion

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.340 
think you know I had this discussion
before<00:03:25.320> about<00:03:26.300> easy<00:03:27.300> Maps<00:03:27.630> versus<00:03:28.170> more

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
before about easy Maps versus more

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.220 
before about easy Maps versus more
difficult<00:03:28.860> Maps<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.430> honestly<00:03:29.820> think<00:03:30.300> yes

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
difficult Maps and I honestly think yes

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.830 
difficult Maps and I honestly think yes
they've<00:03:31.500> made<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.860> very<00:03:32.010> very<00:03:32.220> easy<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:32.810> by<00:03:33.810> I

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
they've made it very very easy here by I

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.010 
they've made it very very easy here by I
honestly<00:03:34.680> think<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.610> will<00:03:35.970> improve<00:03:36.630> or

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
honestly think that that will improve or

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.500 
honestly think that that will improve or
add<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> longevity<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.820> map<00:03:39.090> people

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
add to the longevity of the map people

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.020 
add to the longevity of the map people
will<00:03:39.720> enjoy<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.290> more<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.670> really

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
will enjoy it more if it's really really

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.880 
will enjoy it more if it's really really
difficult<00:03:42.300> people<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> hard<00:03:43.410> time<00:03:43.470> with

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
difficult people have a hard time with

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.440 
difficult people have a hard time with
it<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.220> they<00:03:44.340> can't<00:03:44.550> get<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.730> good<00:03:44.970> rounds<00:03:45.330> and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.170 
or whatever
I<00:03:48.480> think<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.470> map<00:03:49.770> tends<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.400> fizzle<00:03:50.790> out<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
I think the map tends to fizzle out a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.570 
I think the map tends to fizzle out a
lot<00:03:51.600> more<00:03:51.780> quickly<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.830> lot<00:03:53.070> more<00:03:53.220> players

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
lot more quickly for a lot more players

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.729 
lot more quickly for a lot more players
whereas<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.300> think<00:03:54.330> with<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.870> map<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.650> know

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
whereas I think with this map you know

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.500 
whereas I think with this map you know
not<00:03:55.950> only<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.519> mention<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
not only to mention that the the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.210 
not only to mention that the the
epicness<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> map<00:03:58.440> itself<00:03:58.890> like<00:03:59.100> it's

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
epicness of the map itself like it's

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.210 
epicness of the map itself like it's
pretty<00:03:59.430> it's<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.820> pretty<00:04:00.030> damn<00:04:00.300> good<00:04:00.360> map<00:04:01.220> but

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
pretty it's a pretty damn good map but

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.400 
pretty it's a pretty damn good map but
add<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.970> fact<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.200> get

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
add to that the fact that you can get

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.740 
add to that the fact that you can get
all<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.680> equipment<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.550> it's<00:04:06.239> it's

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
all this equipment it can it's it's

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.280 
all this equipment it can it's it's
fairly<00:04:07.110> easy<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:08.340> run<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.239> higher<00:04:09.480> rounds<00:04:10.170> I

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
fairly easy to run to higher rounds I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.410 
fairly easy to run to higher rounds I
think<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.920> increases<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.700> longevity<00:04:11.910> of

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
think just increases the longevity of

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.660 
think just increases the longevity of
and<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.440> playability<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and the playability of the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.699 
and the playability of the
so<00:04:15.000> what's<00:04:15.300> your<00:04:15.420> opinion<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.930> don't<00:04:15.990> know<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
so what's your opinion I don't know the

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.930 
so what's your opinion I don't know the
