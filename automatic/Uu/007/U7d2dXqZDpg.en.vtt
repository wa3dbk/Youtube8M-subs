two-piece<00:02:14.069> case<00:02:14.340> obviously<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.269> the

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
two-piece case obviously this is the

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.410 
two-piece case obviously this is the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
holster and this is the actual case

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.000 
holster and this is the actual case
itself<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.200> looks<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.439> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.799> two

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
itself and it looks like this is a two

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.490 
itself and it looks like this is a two
piece<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.549> well<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:21.090> let's<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:21.989> ahead<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:22.230> see

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
piece as well and let's go ahead and see

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.399 
piece as well and let's go ahead and see
if<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.220> yes<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.970> two<00:02:24.269> piece<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.260> has

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
if it is yes it is a two piece so it has

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.860 
if it is yes it is a two piece so it has
a<00:02:25.439> silicone<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.909> also<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
a silicone and then you also have the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.990 
a silicone and then you also have the
outer<00:02:28.230> shell<00:02:28.620> which<00:02:29.159> is<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.459> protect<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
outer shell which is going to protect it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.869 
outer shell which is going to protect it
from<00:02:30.239> dropping<00:02:31.200> itself<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.489> also<00:02:32.609> has<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
from dropping itself and it also has a

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.759 
from dropping itself and it also has a
really<00:02:33.180> nice<00:02:33.390> thick<00:02:33.750> padding<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.409> as<00:02:34.560> well

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
really nice thick padding here as well

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.830 
really nice thick padding here as well
and<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.670> four<00:02:35.970> layers<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.540> drop

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and this is four layers of drop

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080 
and this is four layers of drop
protection<00:02:37.049> so<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.609> is<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> really

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
protection so I think this is a really

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.520 
protection so I think this is a really
awesome<00:02:39.359> case<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.019> really<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.409> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
awesome case and I really like the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.130 
awesome case and I really like the
holster<00:02:41.099> as<00:02:41.310> well<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.989> go

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140

ahead<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.290> click<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:43.970> this<00:02:44.970> will

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
ahead and click it on and this will

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.780
