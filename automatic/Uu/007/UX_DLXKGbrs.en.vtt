I've<00:00:00.179> been<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.480> reader<00:00:00.810> since<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.500> was<00:00:01.680> about

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I've been a reader since I was about

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.560 
I've been a reader since I was about
three<00:00:02.310> years<00:00:02.340> old<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.000> was<00:00:03.210> an<00:00:03.300> only<00:00:03.449> child

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
three years old I was an only child

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.480 
three years old I was an only child
actually<00:00:04.410> my<00:00:04.529> husband<00:00:04.950> was<00:00:05.130> an<00:00:05.220> only<00:00:05.370> child

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
actually my husband was an only child

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.299 
actually my husband was an only child
too<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.170> think<00:00:07.319> as<00:00:07.649> children<00:00:08.040> always

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
too so we I think as children always

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.830 
too so we I think as children always
thought<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.610> books<00:00:08.820> as<00:00:09.000> our<00:00:09.150> friends

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
thought of books as our friends

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.720 
thought of books as our friends
I<00:00:09.870> think<00:00:10.260> there's<00:00:10.530> almost<00:00:10.769> no<00:00:11.219> room<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I think there's almost no room in the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.850 
I think there's almost no room in the
house<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.269> doesn't<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:13.139> collection<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
books you have to move every few years

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.019

to<00:00:15.900> have<00:00:16.049> more<00:00:16.289> wall<00:00:16.529> space<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.730> when

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
to have more wall space it's like when

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.460 
to have more wall space it's like when
we<00:00:18.119> turn<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> lights<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.109> night<00:00:19.289> they
