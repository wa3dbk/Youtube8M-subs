00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.350
 a happiness I also starve 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 what are you after you have determined once 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 lammert do 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.100
 and you know I have no idea 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.519
 but what does an estate look like ? 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 you digest it well for the figure and well 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:37.309
 mini the mini jobber media 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.309
 Well, keep great 850 times later 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.559
 so if the next delivered friend 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 it is no joke 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 the next time a delivery service 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:59.149
 then comes what is going on behind 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.289
 shape moment moment if you 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.960
 at the next delivery service again 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.020
 have asked and have eaten and have 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 you still a few garbage things 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 would not necessarily have to throw away 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.119
 so you can also pick up here for 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.530
 For example, there was lettuce in it 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.720
 I knew what you were here 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.470
 other wall actually impressed by 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.759
 koran cellar 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 ok yes and here is how it is entered 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.009
 in fact a Chinese thermometer 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.619
 so it's perfect for keeping something warm 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.320
 what can you transport longer 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.130
 little nimble agile if you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.170
 known you know it forum 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.430
 what I or my friends and you want 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.829
 that bringing one from a to b is that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.140
 not always useful is your box 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.789
 sometimes it will increase too 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.369
 a little little weather 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.049
 or if you notice things 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.590
 have several litter in the must also 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.439
 separated 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.329
 then packed the simple conditions 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.220
 and there you can transport safely 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:03.950
 and even better with terror 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.590
 nice was what I like what I like completely 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.989
 like to do the thing here with me 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.599
 coral lickers have been glued and the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.910
 still have to harden without streaming 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.040
 then I had a couple of important ones she was 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.890
 here in the container with the sea water 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.230
 out of the big pool and there we can 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.370
 first wants to know and if the firm 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.290
 and then they come at the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.090
 next time 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.799
 Delivery services simply pick up the soon 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.410
 rinse well 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.060
 and then he is ready for the next one 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.319
 transport that wolf since two 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.610
 In any case, pay attention to that 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.250
 then no 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.440
 first time in there else said yes to increase 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.100
 So until next time Salzer week 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.100
