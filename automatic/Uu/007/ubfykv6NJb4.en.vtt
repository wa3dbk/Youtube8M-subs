00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.519
 so hello everyone to the next episode of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 they still do not fÃ¼nflingen minecraft 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.280
 knew and how he sees just got 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 I somehow made the world for me 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 bombed therefore outside a question for 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 Maybe you still want to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.949
 have been through here have been or 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.119
 just not so lax is mine 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.340
 nothing special in itself 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.109
 I want to get away in there and I believe 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.699
 I presented in the place that was the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.900
 with the lantern and then somehow 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.970
 punk mistakes happened then he sees it like that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.769
 therefore always look if you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.239
 between versions change that many 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.219
 another version then it can 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.410
 sometimes that is the world is destroyed 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.980
 so then again some great things 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 searched out 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.050
 I hope that's right 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 you'll see something interesting soon 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.559
 now all of them again how much about that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.610
 had to be resourceful if you too 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 else ideas so liked to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 but please do not send it via pn per 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 facebook and not by comment and that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 video or on the channel because that will 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 I most likely overlooked there 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 namely this time in north face book with 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.530
 in there because I happened to see it though 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.949
 please if it goes by pn to that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 send youtube mailbox let 's go 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.670
 so then let's start with the easy 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.049
 the simplest thing I have her and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.369
 she is still persistent today 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.119
 not even where not so easy to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.830
 come see na times 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.750
 the first thing is flax and he 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 He actually writes his thing 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.560
 you must have heard of it alone 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 you rarely look for it 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 Dispensers also come armor parts 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.680
 out in the trap and they become one 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 also dressed so we wanted the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 pressure plates over it runs who first 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 once had it lost or it 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.560
 maybe also me and the pain 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.189
 he knows that maybe not me 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.659
 show it for a moment 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.869
 I do not have anything at the moment but I do 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.280
 the troupe will keep running over it 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.990
 the teams out that people the one 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.090
 actually already dressed directly 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.310
 so you instantly put in the inventory 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.689
 get so that in principle the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 lowest of the difficulty 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.920
 from this consequence and nevertheless I found 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 still be genuine that even purely to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.360
 it will be a little bit packed now 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.180
 more interesting the next thing is from 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.070
 nrw that was the comment of facebook 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.770
 not only as far as I have seen and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.149
 it was about one story with tnt 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.799
 if you bend with the enchantment 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.200
 Flames then also enchant in the tea 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.850
 blog shoots the igniters in 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.079
 the block I have a closer look 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.310
 looked a bit closer and then 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.869
 just to do with that that tnt 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.430
 is ignited and therefore he is fact 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.349
 actually a bit 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.239
 and more precisely summarized more precisely 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.730
 world now declare no matter how you 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.290
 I had to be with bow 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.500
 always if that didnt light up now 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.849
 is just the fuse so left around 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.879
 and if I am here next to it 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.650
 At the end of the topic she is still left around 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.060
 but she turns on top of it once 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.469
 that is the block is directed 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.980
 somehow a certain direction 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:37.230
 then go out and that is 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.599
 honestly, there's a new short thing there 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.919
 which always show exactly dwd first 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.650
 always first up but as far as he goes 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.310
 is fired amazon 90 degrees 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.169
 to the side 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.000
 Whatever I have never done 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.680
 not being respected at all 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.769
 therefore the which I found a bit 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.409
 tricky and on it goes the next 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.000
 thing is signed by osram 03.03 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.889
 if you go through a nice party yourself 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.090
 teleported and not on the net from the 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.950
 portal goes and of course it is also 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.569
 backwards and now from the normal 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.040
 world into the web portals or from never 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.290
 portal back normal world it is 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.669
 no matter then one wore placed and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.840
 this opens like the inventory of this 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.290
 did not show this dress 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.650
 made 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.840
 in the budget is not displayed and you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.419
 can go out of the portal and the door 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.709
 Just stay open of a thing 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.760
 remains open exist 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.470
 he is a bit far 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.870
 away then disappears again 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.930
 but if you stand from one point 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.329
 then we have the case as well 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.000
 now, for example, when I open it 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.470
 that this first remains open first 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.299
 just like that and does not close from 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.139
 alone 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.269
 interesting times to see and when it works 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.739
 that it collapses the sender 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.259
 certain blog bordering on a wise 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.459
 I have never been so bad either 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.819
 Tried rather coincidentally that one so 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.669
 the next thing is discovered by user 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.430
 mystery and he is now writing a video 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.699
 sent in as you can without a command 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.769
 blocks it creates blocks to create 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.180
 the same on all sides 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.470
 Textures I've already shown that 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.569
 you can insert it with a command 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.639
 The car has long been on all sides 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.799
 for example, the text clock in the morning 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.569
 to see cut for this trunk 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.780
 is and as well as for example 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.450
 piste that this stop on all four 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.610
 pages on all six pages 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.850
 the corresponding texture of the stars 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.750
 on top of it has a kind like that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.630
 boxes are still familiar with this 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.270
 server and that works with this 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.390
 nice preppy equipment i want that 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.860
 short analog black times show her see 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.570
 Now it's a woodcut, so to speak 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.550
 Boys also a woodcut outside 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.840
 Wood texture and we can do this 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.880
 special blog also certainly 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.520
 mass producers suspect a dispenser 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.970
 with twelve island in it now slowly from 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.290
 down through a glass block in the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.830
 wooden block up here a pier shoots 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.080
 then next we have at the side 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.000
 has very nice and I had to be here 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.010
 times logging put such a s.der 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.990
 side guys again dispensers on it 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.000
 cease to shoot down and this 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.800
 button where the signal we over there 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.050
 let's grab those slopes of something 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.400
 then delay the blog now presses the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.440
 then come out again a fine of the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.060
 more are and the case of the flies 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.530
 down here is from this blog to 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.180
 Side pushed that in the air 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.500
 floats and what happens then and how 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.840
 that's exactly what shows the same time 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.850
 to talk, and I now have the 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.280
 finer popped all the following now 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.620
 this case is here now for 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.750
 pushed and pushed the air 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.550
 Here is the blog service 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.050
 want gold he sat druckplatte 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.580
 has seen update here 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.660
 surface changed now we have here 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.890
 all around the wood texture once 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.900
 Get it complete means we have 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.110
 completely in vanilla that is 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.170
 Men complete without commands and command 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.500
 this block 6 since I'm six early 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.640
 texture erich made not bad 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.600
 But first it really comes on it 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.920
 already on pistols feel the same way and 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.780
 The last thing today is from Freddie 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.220
 Highmore writes when snowmen 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.720
 Money often gives you more snowballs 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.370
 out when needed to get around 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.900
 create 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.780
 Yes, that's fine, though 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.150
 for a bloody +3 sword bought so 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.620
 or worried what you normally think too 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.210
 expensive fashion gets from the maximum 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.400
 distance ins we test the just 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.410
 I've tried it before 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.820
 but you get the highest but new and you 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.450
 needed eight snowballs around you 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.770
 to build a snowman 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.910
 theoretically you can not get that 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.230
 back but only from the theory 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.910
 theory 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.280
 i have a 12 12 12 snowballs 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.990
 by a snowman she is one 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.300
 If I prove the theory 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.880
 together forces are the three 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.310
 snowflake but to make that 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.740
 you only need two so, but also something 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.250
 So get some new snowballs 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.160
 killed as that can come yes 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.840
 it would not be so with it 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.760
 you have already been for today 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.080
 for watching if you have ideas on 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.000
 they are as good as they are 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.690
 Send in and then let me in 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.640
 Comment how it looks like with 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.830
 reviews how many did you know 255 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.120
 Of course, let me know 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.310
 Others are likely to comment
