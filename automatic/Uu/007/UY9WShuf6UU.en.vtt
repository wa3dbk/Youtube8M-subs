00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.069
 sun heat and salt water also combine 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.330
 with luxury and glamor 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 is what shows the roberta architect 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.080
 button the project of an apartment in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.080
 beach brava in florianÃ³polis 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.309
 golden and love by the sea of â€‹â€‹love 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.370
 combines with salt water I also think 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.920
 that the best shape of blue prom 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 sea is white so it does not collide 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 this was the premise that the work in the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 brave beach than white off white and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.300
 would really be the palette 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.930
 background of this work so that the milestone is 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.930
 sovereign 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.399
 the golden sun went down inside the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 apartment came to it is so when 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.329
 we started doing the study of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 houses and apartments with that passed the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 briefing and did some research came 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.430
 much in a warehouse love that one 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 chic atmosphere that is stripped down and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 relaxed but never the basic is well 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.720
 I love to leave that's what we want 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.720
 bring to this apartment 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.990
 I think one of the high points of being 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.229
 this apartment really is the carpet 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.470
 with graphics a sony allusion in these tones 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.659
 beige white and navy blue then 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.780
 to give a color and not to hit the sea 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780
 more 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.930
 a large family that summer houses 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.729
 all the children grandchildren friends is a house 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.130
 a lot of movement of people who love 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.470
 receive the premise that it was a house 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.110
 fully integrated into a kitchen that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.549
 there is no work year the original plant of the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.380
 apartment she in the back she came 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.509
 stop here in front of the sea 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.890
 the sale was all closed integrated with the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.149
 remaining free 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.710
 we chose nine well-relaxed 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.000
 So we have him, he only makes flax. 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.700
 with cover 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.650
 we have some chairs in the art well 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.230
 basic is a rustic chic as far as I'd say 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.530
 the table cladding also the people 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.390
 has a stone with a very opaque texture 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.510
 We did not want it to have any shine. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.510
 he then I play it so 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.120
 charm is the wallpaper of that 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.790
 room is the best we can and then we 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.790
 has a background comes in another 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.600
 we had a wall with an extension 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.459
 very big and I always wondered 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.109
 so I'll do with this wall 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.000
 so it does not get heavy so that 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.980
 they are a beautiful backdrop but 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.900
 that also does not hit home then I 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.299
 always thought of a straw a straw 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.910
 white with gold a very light thing 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.280
 but at the same time very loving, I 'm going 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.230
 to follow that is another he entered very strong 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.819
 also in my projects it came from a 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.250
 very different way than usually 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.650
 she has gray with black paint 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 and this time she came very neutral white 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.720
 Just to make a couple disapproving tea. 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.790
 the carpentry she also a matter 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.190
 fleeing rather with us we used 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.860
 a chain always doing all the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.100
 detailing in white frames more 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.390
 once in this graphic all the doors 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.710
 a footprint as well as a 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.090
 geometric 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.480
 so I did not want it to be a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.850
 Cold woodworking and will be I think it came 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.800
 to perfectly close our 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.750
 idea 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.700
 The legal thing about this book is because 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.290
 apartment in the same city 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.330
 customer we have used this proposal from the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.850
 south is he and to love she asked that 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.370
 was repeated here on the beach because 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.290
 family as soon as possible. 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.570
 we really have a broad 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.540
 I understand this hot thing you can 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.310
 lying down when alone or together and 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.940
 to make this intersection of the two 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.470
 sofas and then say on a small table that 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.420
 It is actually a chest for storing 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.420
 stains all closed 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.639
 I always thought of something that 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.560
 impact on the entrance hall and 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.639
 to translate the entire soul of the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.259
 apartment 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.090
 so I have the golden frame on 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.750
 gold leaf is another element that I 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.880
 I love it and it actually does a contrast 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 very large with the demolition furniture 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.020
 that is one element is that I do not use in my 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.479
 projects but found here on the beach 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.729
 the demolition with the gold was 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.759
 completely unpretentious chic and the 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.680
 corals it in white and current making 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.680
 this mix 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.600
 the chips they are very spartan are 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.820
 comfortable and beautiful practices and 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.760
 we wanted all this atmosphere of the 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.900
 lacquer room white sand was for 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.370
 the rooms 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.710
 but in fact we only work with 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.960
 a nice headboard to put on the wall and 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.150
 nothing more was that it was a nicely 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.150
 practical to use the same beach 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.790
 feedback from customers here roberta is 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.260
 very suspicious to talk about their 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.110
 customers as well as customers are 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.840
 same great personal friends and I already did 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.760
 Several works for them, the children 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.919
 I have a family apartment 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.080
 center that is already in the case file 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.530
 company also the center apartment 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.830
 then we made the brava that in the 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.310
 holy and now the head employed that 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.310
 the newlyweds 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.520
 the next I think it's going to be a house 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.520
 an area
