00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
pre-record cinemax so you can see that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.390 
pre-record cinemax so you can see that
the<00:02:12.020> models<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.560> characters<00:02:13.010> are<00:02:13.130> much

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
here is the simulator we actually be

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.409 
here is the simulator we actually be
able<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:51.009> kind<00:05:51.340> of<00:05:51.400> test<00:05:51.610> out<00:05:51.789> different<00:05:51.819> units

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
but the central part of this base

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.010 
but the central part of this base
interact<00:06:02.289> with<00:06:02.530> is<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:03.190> technology<00:06:04.030> console
