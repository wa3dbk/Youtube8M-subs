00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
 place underwater 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.820
 the river place in all its trace 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:14.530
 it has practically grown to little levels 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.530
 frequent watch what you 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.900
 a thing isolated completely look in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.660
 some stretches in some part of the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.400
 city and the water almost reaching the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.960
 basilica I insist images that I think that 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.960
 it's year 85 were not seen 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.149
 good, you need javier torrente there, no 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 you are listening also give you step 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.609
 specialist 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 in everything that has to do with the 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:46.680
 open climate as well as the images that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.039
 we are seeing that he was gathering 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.589
 information and what you see there 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 just in the luján river basin 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.820
 that is overflowed 4 meters above 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.239
 of what corresponds is to say by 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.589
 above the maximum limit that would be there in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 the area where the games are 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.220
 side of the basilica for those who 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.350
 they know their master seeing the basilica 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.890
 clear and it's there just and the water and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.960
 side is next because it has gone up the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.350
 let's say, let's say, some 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 way and has pierced all the fences 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 the protection that there may be there for 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.119
 be located at a rate of 23 centimeters 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.030
 per hour according to local media 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.920
 yesterday at dawn that was going up from 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 where the water comes is good in water 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.299
 that is coming from sectors of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.520
 beyond where obviously the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.909
 precipitation as we talked yesterday was 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
 very disproportionate there were areas it was not 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 even it is not that it rained 120 millimeters 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 like in the city good aires even in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.420
 everywhere 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 there were areas where it rained less than there 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.509
 it's problem the problem was where I see 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.460
 much more that has reached 150 170 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.630
 millimeters in some sectors of the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.340
 province of buenos aires and the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 runoff is done through the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.330
 natural channels that are the rivers that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.899
 some flow into the silver river 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.360
 and others beyond then contributing towards 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.069
 the Atlantic ocean then clear the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.540
 embankment that descends towards the area 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.030
 maritime or river like the one 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.640
 river of silver makes the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.830
 runoff is caused through 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.890
 these veins let's say so are the rivers 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.110
 but they overflow because they can not cope 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.330
 is to is almost almost over income 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 to the basilica but it 's that they like me 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 that's the beach this is the beach 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.850
 exactly be in the environment or who 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.440
 who does not know or who knows Luján already 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.720
 be for coat walking when you enter 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.950
 walking the pilgrimages obviously 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.290
 it's all the entrance to the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.850
 basilica the great central avenue not 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.810
 it is exactly under watch look 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.520
 help people crossing 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.670
 the images of the helicopter are 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.220
 magnificent the image is that it is unique and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.980
 exclusive you can also achieve see the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.900
 magnitude of this only from the air 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.670
 it's the only way you can get to 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.770
 appreciate and fix the transport is 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.319
 work endure side and the terminal that 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.810
 is next and look also like the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.840
 overflow here it looks perfectly that it is 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.650
 the totally saturated river impossible to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.450
 channel as much water as you can 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.580
 start to grow as I said during 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.890
 the early morning that 23-centimeter rhythm 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.910
 per hour out there we can not do 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.860
 an idea but pretty much notice that 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.330
 during until the morning hour the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.480
 first thing in the morning 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.340
 that was the rate of growth and there 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.310
 Keeps clear when it's going to drain 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.709
 good when you also start to help a 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.660
 little low tide now we are employing 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.049
 sea ​​is starting to rise we are 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.049
 reaching
