00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.330
 hello everyone I bring a game very 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:17.380
 very good good of the aircraft simulator 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.750
 it's called f-18 carrier is a simulator 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.140
 that truth has me astonished by its 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 characteristics and its graphic performance 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 well i will show it 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.170
 description of the video leave the link for 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.079
 download it 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:43.510
 well, logically, you may need 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.000
 robust processors like memory 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.800
 robust 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 to be able to do it really 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.500
 on topics that all without cell phones 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.080
 you need in high and stable range 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.200
 after the thanks that already a gig of 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.200
 processor and 512 ram 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.460
 good here is loading here begins 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.240
 The mission 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.909
 so they see the graphic system very 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.800
 interesting very 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.800
 I think it starts on an aircraft carrier 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.830
 and talking about how you can see the design 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.710
 graphic of the plane is with its shadow and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.030
 brightness depending on sunlight 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 and if it is inside the cabin 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 terrific supremely cool 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.110
 piloting and life 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.090
 there is a grace the first mission I think 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.300
 have him land on an aircraft carrier 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.300
 so little by little giving him missions 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.900
 roy keane 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.630
 ability to fly 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.820
 it is handled as you can see it with 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.820
 movement of the accelerometer tablet 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.879
 so that is going to be the process of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.879
 landing 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.420
 of the previous one to finish here the pilot 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.040
 the artist already 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.980
 I think we have arrived quickly 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 I think very fast 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.819
 Well, that's what the game is about, try it 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.290
 and comment how about me 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.980
 I recommend 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.629
 I duel and good that I enjoyed it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.629
 until the next ciao
