00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.970 
say I sat through from 8:00 to 9:30 and
then<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> kind<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.660> zoned<00:02:27.720> out<00:02:28.140> from<00:02:28.380> 9:30<00:02:28.740> to

then I kind of zoned out from 9:30 to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.280 
then I kind of zoned out from 9:30 to
10:00<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.700> Chris<00:02:30.090> Jericho<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.750> Paul

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
10:00 when the Chris Jericho and Paul

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.090

Heyman<00:02:31.440> thing<00:02:31.770> started<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:34.290> watch

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
Heyman thing started and then I watch

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.160 
Heyman thing started and then I watch
pretty<00:02:35.459> much<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.090> then<00:02:36.690> Roman<00:02:36.989> reigns

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
came out right after that and I guess

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.580

important thing that being the Heyman

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.240 
important thing that being the Heyman
and<00:03:25.890> Jericho<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.640> Lesnar<00:03:27.049> segment<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.250> right

10:30<00:03:32.400> -<00:03:32.790> well<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.420> guess<00:03:33.780> pretty<00:03:34.019> much<00:03:34.140> after

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
10:30 - well I guess pretty much after

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.690 
10:30 - well I guess pretty much after
after<00:03:34.950> 10<00:03:35.250> maybe<00:03:35.670> 10<00:03:35.970> after<00:03:36.120> 10<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:37.140> 10:45<00:03:38.100> is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
after 10 maybe 10 after 10 to 10:45 is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180 
after 10 maybe 10 after 10 to 10:45 is

tweet<00:04:13.200> through<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.470> exact<00:04:13.739> same<00:04:13.769> like<00:04:14.220> why

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
tweet through the exact same like why

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.039 
tweet through the exact same like why
isn't<00:04:14.549> there<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:14.940> going<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.359> measured<00:04:15.780> ended

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
isn't there so going this measured ended

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.830 
isn't there so going this measured ended
ten<00:04:16.229> minutes<00:04:16.500> ago<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.130> long<00:04:18.000> long<00:04:18.299> tag-team

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
ten minutes ago but a long long tag-team

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.640 
ten minutes ago but a long long tag-team
match<00:04:19.019> uh<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.690> that's<00:04:21.690> all<00:04:21.989> they<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.349> three

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
match uh but that's all they have three

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.080 
match uh but that's all they have three
hours<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.919> kill<00:04:23.159> and<00:04:23.400> three<00:04:23.640> hours<00:04:23.909> is<00:04:24.060> just

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
hours to kill and three hours is just

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.490 
hours to kill and three hours is just
way<00:04:24.330> too<00:04:24.390> long<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.870> think<00:04:25.050> that's<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.260> only<00:04:25.289> way

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
way too long I think that's the only way

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.590 
way too long I think that's the only way
I<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.650> put<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.919> if<00:04:26.159> you<00:04:27.000> have<00:04:27.180> an<00:04:27.330> hour

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
I can put it if you have an hour

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.050 
I can put it if you have an hour
were<00:04:27.660> hour<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> half<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.010> two<00:04:29.190> hours<00:04:29.580> show<00:04:29.820> I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
were hour and a half to two hours show I

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.180 
were hour and a half to two hours show I
think<00:04:30.660> it's<00:04:31.020> perfect<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.620> know<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:31.770> think<00:04:32.070> a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
think it's perfect you know I think a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.240 
think it's perfect you know I think a
lot<00:04:32.370> right<00:04:32.640> now<00:04:32.670> two<00:04:33.660> hours<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.440> sometimes

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
lot right now two hours is sometimes

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.860 
lot right now two hours is sometimes
even<00:04:35.550> seems<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:35.910> too<00:04:36.090> much<00:04:36.120> considering

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
even seems like too much considering

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.900 
even seems like too much considering
that<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:38.130> know<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.280> have<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> bunch<00:04:38.820> of

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
that you know you have a bunch of

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.870 
that you know you have a bunch of
pointless<00:04:39.150> things<00:04:39.480> but<00:04:39.900> I've<00:04:40.620> heard<00:04:41.130> like<00:04:41.820> a

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
pointless things but I've heard like a

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.610 
pointless things but I've heard like a
lot<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.270> wrestlers<00:04:42.600> say<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.990> 90<00:04:43.320> minutes

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
lot of wrestlers say that 90 minutes

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.780 
lot of wrestlers say that 90 minutes
would<00:04:43.680> be<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.920> perfect<00:04:44.160> time<00:04:44.520> for<00:04:44.550> a

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
would be the perfect time for a

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.840 
would be the perfect time for a
wrestling<00:04:45.180> wrestling<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.810> show<00:04:46.230> at<00:04:46.410> all

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
wrestling wrestling a show at all

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.360 
wrestling wrestling a show at all
um<00:04:47.930> 60<00:04:48.930> minutes<00:04:49.230> seems<00:04:49.710> like<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:49.950> little<00:04:50.220> less

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
um 60 minutes seems like a little less

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.980 
um 60 minutes seems like a little less
considering<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.180> roster<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:51.780> big

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
considering that the roster is so big

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.350 
considering that the roster is so big
and<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.200> got<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.470> do<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:52.800> much<00:04:53.150> better<00:04:54.150> now<00:04:54.330> err

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and you got to do so much better now err

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.970 
and you got to do so much better now err
and<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.540> half<00:04:54.690> definitely<00:04:55.620> seems<00:04:55.800> like

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
and a half definitely seems like

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.740 
and a half definitely seems like
something<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.520> would<00:04:56.730> look<00:04:57.180> into<00:04:57.390> but

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
something you would look into but

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.480 
something you would look into but
they're<00:04:58.350> making<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:58.770> much<00:04:58.920> money<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.250> guess

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
they're making so much money I guess

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.160 
they're making so much money I guess
with<00:04:59.670> three<00:04:59.880> hours<00:05:00.150> over<00:05:00.450> what<00:05:00.630> sleep<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.080> the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
with three hours over what sleep and the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.730 
with three hours over what sleep and the
big<00:05:01.350> deal<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.770> us<00:05:02.070> complaining<00:05:02.580> every<00:05:02.880> week

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
big deal of us complaining every week

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.770 
big deal of us complaining every week
but<00:05:04.740> who<00:05:05.340> knows<00:05:05.580> that's<00:05:05.910> all<00:05:06.060> I'll<00:05:06.540> see<00:05:06.720> you

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
but who knows that's all I'll see you

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.380 
but who knows that's all I'll see you
