as<00:01:24.720> well<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.470> though<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.680> crashed<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
as well and even though I crashed it a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
as well and even though I crashed it a
lot<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.610> still<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.150> solid<00:01:27.420> built<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
lot it is still very solid built and I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
lot it is still very solid built and I
don't<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> worry<00:01:28.890> anything<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
don't have to worry anything about that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.999 
don't have to worry anything about that
you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.329> also<00:01:30.479> lift<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.259> take<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> off

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you can also lift it up or take it off

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
you can also lift it up or take it off
with<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.369> hands<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
with your hands like so so it's that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
with your hands like so so it's that
it's<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.840> type<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.290> control<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.460> look

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it's that type of control that if I look

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
it's that type of control that if I look
a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.790> hesitant<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:37.020> type<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
a little hesitant there is that type of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.569 
a little hesitant there is that type of
trauma<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.740> actually<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.130> good<00:01:38.220> for

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
trauma that's actually really good for

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
trauma that's actually really good for
but<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.420> also<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.869> helicopters<00:01:40.409> coming

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
but now this also the helicopters coming

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
but now this also the helicopters coming
at<00:01:40.860> indoor<00:01:41.250> configuration<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.090> well<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
at indoor configuration as well so you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.330 
at indoor configuration as well so you
get<00:01:42.899> two<00:01:43.049> pieces<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> outdoor<00:01:44.189> this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
get two pieces that was the outdoor this

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
get two pieces that was the outdoor this
is<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> indoor<00:01:44.909> hey<00:01:45.780> basically<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.229> little

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
is the indoor hey basically this little

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
is the indoor hey basically this little
styrofoam<00:01:46.979> piece<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.369> goes<00:01:47.490> around<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
styrofoam piece that goes around it and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
styrofoam piece that goes around it and
keep<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> poking<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.740> eye<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:50.159> while

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
keep from you poking your eye out while

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
keep from you poking your eye out while
you're<00:01:50.549> indoors<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> provides<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.200> lot

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you're indoors but it provides a lot

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.889 
you're indoors but it provides a lot
more<00:01:52.560> stability<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.540> again

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
more stability here and so is again

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
more stability here and so is again
indoors<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.500> even<00:01:55.920> better<00:01:56.130> than<00:01:56.369> outside

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
indoors is even better than outside

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
indoors is even better than outside
because<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.450> styrofoam<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
because of this styrofoam is kind of a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.749 
because of this styrofoam is kind of a
little<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:58.920> easier<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.369> keep<00:01:59.640> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
little bit more easier to keep it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.359 
little bit more easier to keep it
balanced<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.140> stuff<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.250> see

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
balanced and all that stuff and you see

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.100 
balanced and all that stuff and you see
you<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> sit<00:02:03.030> back<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you have to sit back there it's got to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.270 
you have to sit back there it's got to

kind of dark inside as you can see here

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.620 
kind of dark inside as you can see here
if<00:02:29.310> you're<00:02:29.459> looking<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.360> see<00:02:30.540> it's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
kind of dark in the background down but

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.620 
kind of dark in the background down but
the<00:02:32.040> camera<00:02:32.400> itself<00:02:32.640> actually<00:02:33.060> picks<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.420> like

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the camera itself actually picks up like

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.150 
the camera itself actually picks up like
I<00:02:33.959> don't<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.260> whether<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.980> what

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
I don't know whether this I know what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.350 
I don't know whether this I know what
it's<00:02:35.280> doing<00:02:35.489> there<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.880> actually<00:02:36.030> picked

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's doing there but it actually picked

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.820 
it's doing there but it actually picked
up<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.569> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.989> light<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.349> there<00:02:37.590> very

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
up a little bit of light in there very

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.190 
up a little bit of light in there very
well<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.080> these

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
well and so it's just one of these

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.750 
well and so it's just one of these
things<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:40.560> kids<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.099> be<00:02:41.160> able<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.519> be

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
things I think kids would be able to be

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.870 
things I think kids would be able to be
able<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.000> use<00:02:42.239> it's<00:02:42.989> pretty<00:02:43.230> safe<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.920> press<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
able to use it's pretty safe I press it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.339 
able to use it's pretty safe I press it

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
in my office you probably see me using

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.630 
in my office you probably see me using

this live with my you strain during my
live<00:02:47.819> show<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.390> I've<00:02:49.049> crashed<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.500> at

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
live show and I've crashed this at

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
live show and I've crashed this at
everything<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> still<00:02:50.640> keeps<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.060> ticking

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
everything but it still keeps on ticking

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.300 
everything but it still keeps on ticking
the<00:02:51.989> battery<00:02:52.260> life<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.470> pretty<00:02:52.739> good<00:02:52.950> as<00:02:53.069> well

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the battery life is pretty good as well

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.920 
the battery life is pretty good as well
I<00:02:53.549> took<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.819> outside<00:02:53.940> all<00:02:54.390> days<00:02:54.690> shooting

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I took it outside all days shooting

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.780 
I took it outside all days shooting
videos<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.010> able<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.310> come<00:02:56.459> back<00:02:56.579> inside

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
videos and is able to come back inside

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
videos and is able to come back inside
and<00:02:56.970> shoot<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.329> video<00:02:57.510> all<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.049> one<00:02:58.230> charge

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
and shoot this video all on one charge

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.580 
and shoot this video all on one charge
so<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.880> know<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.870> battery<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.260> still<00:03:01.410> pretty

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
so you know the battery is still pretty

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.569 
so you know the battery is still pretty
good<00:03:01.769> in<00:03:01.860> there<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.069> can<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> dish<00:03:02.489> from

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
good in there you can get a dish from

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.610 
good in there you can get a dish from
the<00:03:02.640> batteries<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.150> need<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.560> as

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
this uh this thing totally works is that

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.910 
this uh this thing totally works is that
the<00:03:22.560> actual<00:03:23.190> helicopter<00:03:23.579> itself<00:03:24.769> create<00:03:25.769> a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the actual helicopter itself create a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.509 
the actual helicopter itself create a
portable<00:03:26.489> Wi-Fi<00:03:26.730> bubble<00:03:27.540> around<00:03:27.600> itself<00:03:28.230> and

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
portable Wi-Fi bubble around itself and

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.890 
portable Wi-Fi bubble around itself and
and<00:03:29.519> then<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.880> your<00:03:30.000> iPhone<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.569> simply

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and then with your iPhone you simply

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.449 
and then with your iPhone you simply
open<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.139> your<00:03:31.319> Wi-Fi<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.980> connect<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.430> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
open up your Wi-Fi and you connect to it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.250 
open up your Wi-Fi and you connect to it
and<00:03:32.700> pull<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:33.299> both<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.690> devices<00:03:33.810> are

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and pull them both of the devices are

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.479 
and pull them both of the devices are
paired<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.620> each<00:03:34.739> other<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.069> controlling

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
paired to each other and controlling

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.949 
paired to each other and controlling
each<00:03:35.579> other<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.269> don't<00:03:36.510> need<00:03:36.630> really<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
each other so you don't need really a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.390 
each other so you don't need really a
physical<00:03:37.200> internet<00:03:37.680> connection<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:38.190> that's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
physical internet connection like that's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.650 
physical internet connection like that's
how<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.730> be<00:03:38.850> outside<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.480> be

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
how you can be outside and just be

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.330 
how you can be outside and just be
connected<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.230> device<00:03:40.500> because<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> makes

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
connected to the device because it makes

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.220 
connected to the device because it makes
its<00:03:41.489> own<00:03:41.579> Wi-Fi<00:03:41.790> bubble<00:03:42.359> plus<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> camera

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
its own Wi-Fi bubble plus the camera

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.020 
its own Wi-Fi bubble plus the camera
underneath<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.709> really<00:03:43.980> cool<00:03:44.160> at<00:03:44.310> all<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.730> I

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
underneath is really cool at all and I

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.129 
underneath is really cool at all and I
think<00:03:45.239> there<00:03:45.359> are<00:03:45.389> going<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.630> be<00:03:45.690> bringing<00:03:45.959> out

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
think there are going to be bringing out

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.720 
think there are going to be bringing out
some<00:03:46.290> applications<00:03:46.950> update<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.639> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
some applications update to the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.849 
some applications update to the
application<00:03:48.180> where<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.389> can<00:03:48.420> actually

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
application where you can actually

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.140 
application where you can actually
dogfight<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.100> if<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.459> multiple<00:03:50.970> people

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
dogfight so if you have multiple people

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.660 
dogfight so if you have multiple people
with<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.480> same<00:03:51.660> helicopter<00:03:52.350> on<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.280> screen

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
with the same helicopter on the screen

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.460 
with the same helicopter on the screen
itself<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.359> actually<00:03:54.540> shoot<00:03:55.200> missiles

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
itself you can actually shoot missiles

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
itself you can actually shoot missiles
and<00:03:55.769> stuff<00:03:55.889> like<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> think<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.549> what

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
and stuff like that I think that's what

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.190 
and stuff like that I think that's what
they<00:03:56.849> coming<00:03:57.090> out<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:57.359> I'm<00:03:57.660> pretty<00:03:57.989> sure<00:03:58.139> I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
they coming out with I'm pretty sure I

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.870 
they coming out with I'm pretty sure I
heard<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:58.739> anyway<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.459> pretty<00:03:59.609> fun<00:03:59.849> to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
heard that so anyway it's pretty fun to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.220 
heard that so anyway it's pretty fun to
check<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.209> out<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:01.019> kind<00:04:01.170> of

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
check it out on this it's kind of

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.750 
check it out on this it's kind of
expensive<00:04:01.500> though<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.859> cost<00:04:02.069> about<00:04:02.190> 300

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
expensive though this cost about 300
