first match and it is gonna be very very

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.490 
first match and it is gonna be very very
difficult<00:00:15.120> depending<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> team<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.379> are

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
difficult depending on the team we are

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.439 
difficult depending on the team we are
facing<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.400> mechanics<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.180> gonna<00:00:18.300> be

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
facing the mechanics are gonna be

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.910 
facing the mechanics are gonna be
different<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.930> pace<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.740> different

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
different the pace is gonna be different

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.910 
different the pace is gonna be different
so<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> gonna<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.510> difficult<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.769> my

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
so it is gonna be difficult in my

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.490 
so it is gonna be difficult in my
opinion<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.550> finesse<00:00:24.060> shots<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.510> pretty<00:00:25.230> bad

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
opinion and finesse shots are pretty bad

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.259 
opinion and finesse shots are pretty bad
in<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> remember<00:00:26.970> that
