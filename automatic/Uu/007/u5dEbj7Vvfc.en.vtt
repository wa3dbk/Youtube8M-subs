00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's what you want to do to make the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.830 
that's what you want to do to make the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
bit faster step over to this side so I'm

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.280 
bit faster step over to this side so I'm
going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.440> speed<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.830> up

two and one and two

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.800 
two and one and two
now<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.739> want<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.070> speed<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.310> up<00:03:49.810> one-and-two

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
now you want to speed it up one-and-two

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.300 
now you want to speed it up one-and-two
one-and-two<00:03:51.519> one-and-two<00:03:52.959> one-and-two

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.560 
one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two
one-and-two<00:03:55.720> one-and-two<00:03:57.100> one-and-two

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.170 
one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two
one-and-two<00:04:00.640> okay<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.700> that's<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.150> basic

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
one-and-two okay so that's the basic

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.420 
one-and-two okay so that's the basic
rock<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.930> poop<00:04:03.080> so<00:04:03.530> these<00:04:03.769> are<00:04:04.040> two<00:04:04.400> different

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
rock and poop so these are two different

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.709 
rock and poop so these are two different
moves<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.180> can<00:04:05.299> do<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.690> passage<00:04:06.140> salsa<00:04:06.500> music
