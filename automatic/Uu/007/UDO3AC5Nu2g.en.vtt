00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.150 
do is when you lay down on the bench try
to<00:00:44.780> position<00:00:45.050> your<00:00:45.320> body<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:45.710> that<00:00:45.739> your<00:00:45.949> eyes

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
are a direct line with the bar and this

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.670 
are a direct line with the bar and this
is<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.730> good<00:00:49.970> position<00:00:50.300> because<00:00:50.839> you're<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.350> far

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
is a good position because you're a far

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.500 
is a good position because you're a far
enough<00:00:51.920> out<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.940> you're<00:00:53.089> not<00:00:53.120> going<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.420> hit

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
the same time it's not a big movement to

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.319 
the same time it's not a big movement to
counteract<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.370> curve<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.089> I'll<00:00:59.180> just

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
counteract the curve so I'll just

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.950 
counteract the curve so I'll just
demonstrate<00:00:59.480> for<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:01.510> all<00:01:02.510> right<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:02.809> I'm

be when you're doing your bench press
and<00:01:14.960> you'll<00:01:15.200> see<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:15.890> not<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.159> big<00:01:16.580> movement

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
and you'll see it's not a big movement

back what's gonna happen is it's gonna

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.650 
back what's gonna happen is it's gonna
be<00:01:46.740> too<00:01:46.980> far<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.940> I'll<00:01:48.090> risk<00:01:48.330> actually

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
be too far and I'll risk actually

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.920 
be too far and I'll risk actually
expecting<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> other<00:01:54.000> mistake<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.750> you're

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
expecting the other mistake is if you're

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.100 
expecting the other mistake is if you're
too<00:01:55.920> far<00:01:56.190> down<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.550> bench<00:01:56.760> now<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.080> have

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
too far down the bench now what we have

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.250 
too far down the bench now what we have
is<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.220> form<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.210> try<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.690> get<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
is it's a form that to try and get that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.560 
is it's a form that to try and get that
far<00:02:01.560> off<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.800> it<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:03.450> bracket<00:02:04.020> off

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
far off of it back and then bracket off

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.590 
far off of it back and then bracket off
so<00:02:06.570> always<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.960> sure<00:02:07.110> your<00:02:07.410> eyes<00:02:08.270> there<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
straight line of Berk that's the ideal

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.480 
straight line of Berk that's the ideal
position<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.570> allow<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.590> set<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.370> the
