00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.180
 We are always looked down upon 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.380
 If you don’t study, is it really good? 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.180
 I don't know, I don't care anyway. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 They are saying fart 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 Those things in your mind 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 Be brave and tell them directly 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 Everyone opens your eyes 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.700
 Listen carefully to these sounds from the corner 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.200
 Maybe these are problems that you don't want to face. 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.800
 You are still so quiet now. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.020
 Should we do something? 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 To prove that we want to breathe ourselves 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.660
 I don't want everything 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.280
 All must follow your rules 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 You don't believe because you never listen carefully 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.320
 I know that I should be in the future. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680
 How to face myself 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.180
 Thank you so much. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.840
 Can no longer be close 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760
 I am still the same, I never thought about it. 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.020
 I have to do what others like. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.820
 Hey tell me why this is 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.260
 Live again every day 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.580
 We have been hiding 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.840
 When will this go on? 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.000
 In order to make them all understand 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.900
 I don't want everything 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.440
 All must follow your rules 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.000
 You don't believe because you never listen carefully 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.720
 I know that I should be in the future. 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 How to face myself 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.700
 Thank you so much. 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 Can no longer be close 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.400
 Actually, I don’t understand anything. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.880
 Nothing at all 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.620
 But I know what I want 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.300
 Keep going
