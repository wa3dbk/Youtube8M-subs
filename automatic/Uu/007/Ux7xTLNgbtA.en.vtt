00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
part what we're gonna see here this is

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.950 
part what we're gonna see here this is
the<00:05:37.750> directory<00:05:38.729> that<00:05:39.729> we<00:05:39.940> are<00:05:40.389> running<00:05:40.780> the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
the directory that we are running the

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.790 
the directory that we are running the
script<00:05:41.169> from<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:42.389> by<00:05:43.389> default<00:05:43.659> import<00:05:44.500> but<00:05:44.710> he

here<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.470> actual<00:05:53.979> website<00:05:54.669> URL<00:05:55.330> that

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
here to the actual website URL that

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.710 
here to the actual website URL that
we're<00:05:56.139> gonna<00:05:56.349> move<00:05:56.710> over<00:05:57.159> and<00:05:57.310> in<00:05:57.940> my<00:05:58.120> case<00:05:58.449> it

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
we're gonna move over and in my case it

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:09.930 
we're gonna move over and in my case it

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
so when the website goes live this will

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.840 
so when the website goes live this will
be<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.790> name<00:06:13.970> that<00:06:14.000> we<00:06:14.360> use<00:06:14.660> is<00:06:16.960> we're<00:06:17.960> gonna
