00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.370
 hey together who me the msi gs 70 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.900
 Of course we do not want to 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.219
 just look like it looks from the outside 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.940
 but we just want you 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.799
 show how it looks from the inside and 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.340
 which rust possibilities we here 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.380
 to have 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.689
 We will do the best for you now 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.189
 Just open it and then we will 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.380
 deal with it more closely so to do so 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.750
 On the backside, simply the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.090
 We have solved different screws 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.610
 have screwed around all around 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.620
 which means to solve all 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.829
 and after we solved these screws 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.860
 we can then have the flap behind 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.390
 lose weight so naturally takes a 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.090
 little bit that means we will 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.800
 just fast forward and then you 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.260
 signs so to speak when the screws off 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.399
 as it then continues with the evil 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.129
 not surprised 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.660
 here is another warranty sticker 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.570
 small den 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.420
 you could have broken warranty 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.100
 you are still important only you have to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.410
 do it professionally that means you 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.570
 You must know what you do as it does 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.130
 do not just go wild 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.540
 on and off it provided something broken 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.380
 do then there is of course 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.880
 no guarantee otherwise it is possible 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.930
 if you know it then, so to speak 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.910
 and trust you to open it 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.880
 so now we have all screwed out 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.750
 Now it's called housing, so to speak 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.259
 Pull off at the back 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.560
 You have to be careful about that 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.259
 is still stuck in the frame , so to speak 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.990
 Show you this now the best times 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.970
 means you are best with one 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.860
 old ec card old plastic card 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.750
 in between and and pushes it stops 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.640
 so on but then to the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:04.450
 certain places go wild here 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.450
 you see that very well 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.550
 look dre is around again 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.140
 then you see it here too when it's on 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.690
 a job open is short again 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.970
 follow 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:35.020
 then it's almost all by itself 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:37.569
 on hook out open and we open 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.040
 have here the inner life which means that we 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:46.480
 now clearly see the 2m here 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.410
 sata ssds then we have the once here 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.970
 terabyte hdd we have the fest here 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.709
 built-in battery so we have to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.730
 see 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:04.450
 the two big fans in here 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.970
 is the wlan module still that means a lot 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.790
 there are frustration possibilities here too 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.670
 not at all reason you can just stop 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.209
 exchange smaller elements I search 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.739
 just the memory 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.030
 mainboard still but that will be 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.200
 probably firmly soldered 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.730
 be Operative memory 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.410
 that means I do not have any 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.970
 possibility of working memory and how 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.380
 to exchange with each other 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.090
 we only have those here 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.190
 possibility, so to speak, the m sata 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.830
 exchange 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:46.090
 that means we have toshiba with us 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:48.340
 integrated 128 gb module and we could 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.490
 then, so to speak, another one here 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.900
 Install ssd modules or hold others 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:01.410
 hard disks or a tree yes that is in 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.370
 the msi is here 70 of them 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.500
 then I just looked if 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.320
 the battery in an easy way and 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.990
 wise, that's definitely the case 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.980
 so not possible because it means one would have to 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.840
 then here probably the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.570
 Adhesive film remove the adhesive strip 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.519
 remove and then he will be here 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.109
 to be stuck under it means that it is 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.000
 then spend a little more 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.970
 I can not do that to you here now 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.460
 show the topic anger with nause because we 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.840
 here for just once in our 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.900
 test model so much 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.730
 but you have tinkered so you have 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.010
 because sometimes you are seen from the inside 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.460
 to say what she could change from what 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.740
 not interchangeable is yes and there do 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.720
 We just go back to that so you can 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.600
 just take it easy again 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.800
 insert 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.419
 press briefly so that the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.419
 Smoky at the edge is locked 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.930
 sitting and after each screw pure 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.100
 it was too bad to screw it up 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.710
 already from the msg it 70 I hope it has 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.230
 you like something that kinda 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.370
 inner impression and see you at 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.370
 next time bye
