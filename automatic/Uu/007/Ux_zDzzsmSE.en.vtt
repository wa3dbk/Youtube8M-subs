00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
hey Robbie in this video I'm going to

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.330 
hey Robbie in this video I'm going to
show<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.990> basic<00:00:07.379> step<00:00:07.620> touch<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.160> looks

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
show you the basic step touch it looks

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:19.519 
show you the basic step touch it looks
like<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:16.730> okay<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.720> basic<00:00:18.750> step

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
like this okay so that is the basic step

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.439 
like this okay so that is the basic step
touch<00:00:19.770> now<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> looks<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.820> simple<00:00:21.300> but

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
touch now it looks really simple but

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.000 
touch now it looks really simple but
it's<00:00:21.600> actually<00:00:21.750> composed<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.619> two<00:00:22.830> different

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it's actually composed of two different

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's actually composed of two different
movements<00:00:23.550> first<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.210> all<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.630> two

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
movements first of all we have two

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.599 
movements first of all we have two
stepping<00:00:25.199> side<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.650> side<00:00:25.830> motion<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.340> ones

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
stepping side to side motion which ones

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.990 
stepping side to side motion which ones
like<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:31.369> okay<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.759> looks<00:00:32.820> like

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
like this and and okay so it looks like

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.750 
like this and and okay so it looks like
stepping<00:00:33.780> side<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> side<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.250> second

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
stepping side to side right the second

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.459 
stepping side to side right the second
movement<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.930> less

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
movement here now this one is less

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.650 
movement here now this one is less
obvious<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> balance<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.059> motion<00:00:39.480> which

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
obvious is the balance of motion which

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
obvious is the balance of motion which
is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.320> up-and-up<00:00:41.280> ask<00:00:41.579> which<00:00:41.969> looks<00:00:42.239> like

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
is the up-and-up ask which looks like

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.420 
is the up-and-up ask which looks like
this<00:00:43.040> one-and-two<00:00:44.040> one-and-two<00:00:44.870> one-and-two

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
this one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.660 
this one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two
one-and-two<00:00:48.500> okay<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.489> your

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
one-and-two okay so all it is is your

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
one-and-two okay so all it is is your
bending<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.059> knees<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.899> coming<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.320> then

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bending my knees you're coming up then

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790 
bending my knees you're coming up then
they<00:00:53.460> coming<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.300> okay<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.170> once<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.559> put<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
they coming up okay so once you put the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.799 
they coming up okay so once you put the
two<00:00:56.100> different<00:00:56.610> movements<00:00:56.940> together<00:00:57.090> you'll

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
two different movements together you'll

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
two different movements together you'll
get<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> basic<00:00:58.739> step<00:00:59.039> touch<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.789> let<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.030> show

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
get the basic step touch now let me show

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
get the basic step touch now let me show
you<00:01:00.210> how<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.510> works<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
as you step over to one side you want to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.469 
as you step over to one side you want to
set<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.510> unless<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.890> travel<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.180> want<00:01:09.330> to

not stand back up okay so a little bit
quicker<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.560> looks<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.320> up<00:01:22.320> all

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
quicker it looks like this up and up all

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
quicker it looks like this up and up all
right<00:01:23.280> notice<00:01:23.939> how<00:01:24.150> i<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.869> bounce<00:01:25.080> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
right notice how i have to bounce is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.470 
right notice how i have to bounce is
going<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.740> once<00:01:26.340> i<00:01:26.460> traveled<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.090> side

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
going on once i traveled to one side

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.870 
going on once i traveled to one side
again<00:01:28.200> starting<00:01:28.980> with<00:01:29.010> knees<00:01:29.280> bent<00:01:29.310> we're

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
again starting with knees bent we're

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.110 
again starting with knees bent we're
gonna<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.480> and<00:01:30.860> tuck<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:33.000> the
