00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.100
 there are provisions 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.250
 how long it will take your strength to surrender 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.759
 your men who will be faithful when they 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.400
 Miss the food and have no water 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.050
 men do not fear dying roberto embrace 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.300
 death and well deserved reward 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.550
 then I will be in what they want 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.980
 follow me and do it without hesitation 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.760
 and show that crazy man that you do not know 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.760
 the fear 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.550
 in the name of god 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.690
 my leg 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.650
 my leg silence with the templars 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.650
 they will hear us 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.879
 to him 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.410
 I will stay and take care of him and you will have 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.940
 to continue without us 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.480
 with those ropes you will reach the trap that 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.989
 We have stretched and driven the crushes to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.989
 our enemies 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.159
 You have defeated the forces of Roberto 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.849
 without his hosts it will take a while 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.930
 attack us again tell me you know why 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.930
 you have triumphed now 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
 by listening 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.530
 if you had done the same in the temple 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.090
 of Solomon Altair all this would have 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.020
 avoided I did what you ordered me not 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.180
 works on your own 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.210
 Malik has told me that you act with you 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.080
 arrogance you despise the rules 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.560
 what are you doing there are some rules without 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.490
 the creed of the murderers we are nobody 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.300
 three basic rules that you have forgotten 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.740
 I will remember them 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:53.430
 the most important one moves your sheet of the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.430
 innocent meat I know 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.220
 and happy tongue until I give you 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.890
 permission to use it if you also know 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.380
 the precept why you killed that old man 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.550
 in the temple 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.249
 he was innocent he did not have to die 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.459
 your insolence has no limits 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:16.679
 if you do not become humble in heart what 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.760
 I'll tear it out with my own 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:22.020
 hands 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.690
 the second norm is the one that gives us strength 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.900
 hiding in broad daylight camouflages you 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.690
 the people and fundetec with the crowd what 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.600
 remember it is apparently preferred 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.020
 expose yourself and get attention before 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.860
 attack 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.830
 your worst infraction has been to the third 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.039
 and last rule never commit to the 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.770
 brotherhood its meaning is obvious your 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.159
 acts should never cause us harm or 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.889
 direct or indirect but your selfishness in 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.120
 Jerusalem has put us in danger 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.199
 everyone 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.060
 worse you've brought the enemy home 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.169
 all the men that we have lost have 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.169
 dead because of you 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.210
 I'm really sorry 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.630
 but I do not admit traitors I'm not a 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.460
 traitor 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.319
 your acts mean the opposite 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.319
 he has not left me choice 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.069
 peace be with you to the workshop 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.069
 and you
