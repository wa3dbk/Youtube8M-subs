okay guys what we're looking to hear is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.570 
okay guys what we're looking to hear is
a<00:00:35.200> bit<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.440> back<00:00:35.560> training<00:00:35.830> starting<00:00:36.400> with<00:00:36.489> the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
a bit of back training starting with the

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.610 
a bit of back training starting with the
CT<00:00:36.850> grow<00:00:37.060> so<00:00:37.630> we're<00:00:37.780> going<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.960> smash<00:00:38.230> out<00:00:38.410> some

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
CT grow so we're going to smash out some

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.440 
CT grow so we're going to smash out some
of<00:00:38.739> those<00:00:38.829> bad<00:00:39.190> fall<00:00:39.640> technique<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.210> people

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
of those bad fall technique so people

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.369 
of those bad fall technique so people
get<00:00:40.510> into<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.780> habit<00:00:40.840> of<00:00:40.989> doing<00:00:41.260> because

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
get into the habit of doing because

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.170 
get into the habit of doing because
they're<00:00:41.530> not<00:00:41.590> paying<00:00:41.800> attention<00:00:41.950> she<00:00:42.879> noticed

don't<00:01:07.960> go<00:01:08.050> forward<00:01:08.380> like<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.759> keep<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:09.880> back

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
don't go forward like this keep it back

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.029 
don't go forward like this keep it back
and<00:01:10.240> then<00:01:10.330> don't<00:01:10.539> lean<00:01:10.720> too<00:01:10.869> far<00:01:11.170> back<00:01:11.410> if<00:01:11.890> you

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
and then don't lean too far back if you

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.410 
and then don't lean too far back if you
start<00:01:12.310> right<00:01:12.520> you're<00:01:12.700> finished<00:01:13.030> rights<00:01:13.240> of

lower back arched my chest out and I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.740 
lower back arched my chest out and I
keep<00:01:36.310> looking<00:01:36.580> up<00:01:36.729> at<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.940> pulley<00:01:37.149> exposing

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
keep looking up at the pulley exposing

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.089 
keep looking up at the pulley exposing
my<00:01:37.840> chest<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.200> pulley<00:01:38.410> don't<00:01:38.709> worry<00:01:38.890> about

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
my chest the pulley don't worry about

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.230 
my chest the pulley don't worry about
pulling<00:01:39.369> all<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> way<00:01:39.670> down<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:39.849> your<00:01:40.030> chest

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
you a full contraction point again pull

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.770 
you a full contraction point again pull
from<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> elbows<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:46.149> attention<00:01:46.569> at<00:01:46.660> your

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
from the elbows to attention at your

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.839 
from the elbows to attention at your
hands<00:01:46.899> do<00:01:47.140> not<00:01:47.170> start<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.740> pulling<00:01:48.009> motion<00:01:48.190> in

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:48.849 
hands do not start the pulling motion in

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.699 
hands do not start the pulling motion in
your<00:01:48.910> hands<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:49.630> what<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:49.750> does<00:01:50.020> is<00:01:50.050> engages

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
your hands so what that does is engages

and smash out two more reps it's just a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.680 
and smash out two more reps it's just a
