00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
compromising the iPad size and weight so

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.480 
compromising the iPad size and weight so
rather<00:01:40.570> than<00:01:40.750> developing<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.770> separate<00:01:42.280> case

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
rather than developing a separate case

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.600 
rather than developing a separate case
we<00:01:43.270> created<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.869> cover<00:01:44.229> at<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.740> same<00:01:45.069> time<00:01:45.310> that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
we created a cover at the same time that

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.760 
we created a cover at the same time that
we<00:01:45.700> were<00:01:45.819> actually<00:01:45.880> designing<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.840> iPad<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
we were actually designing the iPad the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.889 
we were actually designing the iPad the
two<00:01:47.950> are<00:01:48.100> made<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.580> work<00:01:48.729> together<00:01:48.940> it

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
two are made to work together it

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.930 
two are made to work together it
attaches<00:01:50.200> magnetically<00:01:50.729> aligns<00:01:51.729> perfectly

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
attaches magnetically aligns perfectly

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.779 
attaches magnetically aligns perfectly
and<00:01:52.780> it's<00:01:53.110> just<00:01:53.380> as<00:01:53.500> easy<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.770> remove<00:01:54.130> when<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
and it's just as easy to remove when the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.059 
and it's just as easy to remove when the
iPad<00:01:55.119> detects<00:01:55.750> you've<00:01:55.959> opened<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.349> cover<00:01:56.649> it

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
iPad detects you've opened the cover it

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.100 
iPad detects you've opened the cover it
immediately<00:01:57.610> wakes<00:01:58.060> from<00:01:58.149> sleep<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.869> when

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
immediately wakes from sleep and when

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.870 
immediately wakes from sleep and when
you<00:01:59.200> close<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.619> cover<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.190> puts<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.520> back<00:02:00.670> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you close the cover it puts it back to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.910

what you're doing on your iPad and any

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.860 
what you're doing on your iPad and any
orientation<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:20.049> full<00:04:20.889> 1080p<00:04:21.539> we've<00:04:22.539> done

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.050 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.139> with<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.560> iPad<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.490> we<00:04:24.610> never

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
things with this iPad that we never

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.270 
things with this iPad that we never
could<00:04:25.389> have<00:04:25.449> done<00:04:25.630> before<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.440> it's<00:04:26.979> because

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
could have done before and it's because

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.820 
could have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.970> lot<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.240> new<00:04:28.600> innovation<00:04:29.260> driving

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.000 
there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:31.510> starts<00:04:31.900> with<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.229> new<00:04:32.410> dual-core<00:04:32.949> a5

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.610 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.820> that's<00:04:34.150> added<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.630> lot<00:04:34.840> more<00:04:34.900> speed<00:04:35.380> to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
chip that's added a lot more speed to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.770 
chip that's added a lot more speed to
things<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.010> do<00:04:36.190> every<00:04:36.220> day<00:04:36.490> like<00:04:37.150> surfing<00:04:37.630> the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
things you do every day like surfing the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.170 
things you do every day like surfing the
web<00:04:37.960> sending<00:04:38.650> email<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.250> multitasking<00:04:40.000> in

web sending email and multitasking in

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.350 
web sending email and multitasking in
fact<00:04:40.930> it's<00:04:41.320> up<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.710> twice<00:04:41.919> as<00:04:42.160> fast<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.090 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.660> we've<00:04:43.900> made<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.199> biggest<00:04:44.470> jump<00:04:44.919> is

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
place we've made the biggest jump is

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.430 
place we've made the biggest jump is
with<00:04:45.400> graphics<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.389> performance<00:04:47.080> that's<00:04:47.289> up

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
with graphics the performance that's up

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.129 
with graphics the performance that's up
to<00:04:47.560> nine<00:04:47.830> times<00:04:48.190> faster<00:04:48.840> you'll<00:04:49.840> really

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
to nine times faster you'll really

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.350 
to nine times faster you'll really
notice<00:04:50.440> this<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.979> games<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.669> apps<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.210> use<00:04:52.330> a

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
notice this in games and apps that use a

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.260 
notice this in games and apps that use a
lot<00:04:52.479> of<00:04:52.690> data<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.220> for<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.310> first<00:04:54.520> time<00:04:54.699> we've

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
lot of data and for the first time we've

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.110 
lot of data and for the first time we've
built<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.630> gyro<00:04:56.080> into<00:04:56.350> this<00:04:56.500> iPad<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.850> gives

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
built a gyro into this iPad that gives

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.480 
built a gyro into this iPad that gives
you<00:04:58.270> very<00:04:58.600> precise<00:04:59.050> control<00:04:59.620> in<00:04:59.860> multiple

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
you very precise control in multiple

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.760 
you very precise control in multiple
dimensions<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.570> allows<00:05:01.810> us<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.470> really

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
dimensions and it allows us to really

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.159 
dimensions and it allows us to really
measure<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.580> orientation<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.479> iPad<00:05:04.990> in

the<00:05:36.510> original<00:05:37.020> iPad<00:05:37.520> defined<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.730> category<00:05:39.330> and

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.170 
the original iPad defined a category and

I think that the ipad 2 will really

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.230 
I think that the ipad 2 will really
define<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:42.780> category<00:05:43.350> for<00:05:43.620> years<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:43.980> come
