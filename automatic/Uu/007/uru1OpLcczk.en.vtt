00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.250
 none of the porten is more than a party 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.420
 because even if it was the second division b rivalry 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.950
 It remains the same 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.169
 not yet 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.310
 let's not kid ourselves the workers 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.680
 in oviedo they expected a goal from osasuna and in the molinón they heated the bench 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.310
 of the subsidiary 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.609
 is one of the names things well added 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.199
 wait a long time that will be delayed and booed for the first time 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.449
 before the judge 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.160
 but this felipe kings 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 how a reception like that is explained in the second division b 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.750
 and that the life of its best days in the last seven years of 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.420
 economically socially 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.690
 as about 15 thousand partners spies the government 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.020
 moore is very difficult to explain 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.400
 it's a feeling of hate is a passion 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.810
 a passion like the one of diego cervero player of the logroñés that did more than 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.090
 300 kilometers to see his former team 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.370
 hsbc I'm sure that out of the pri yesterday's first match 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.260
 that way there are no tickets and the truth is that it was broken 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.159
 and that and yesterday in the tartiere really lived an atmosphere of first 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.320
 Miguel Esteban Andrada that I think for a field of first c 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.100
 srs we are seeing now by the government 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.490
 answer another 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.740
 e enthusiasm and you win because I think that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.340
 we are seeing that people are with the team 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.390
 47 tracks of 15 media and more than 17 thousand spectators 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.730
 they were going to live an amazing ending 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.580
 minute 93 'tie to one 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 and this happened 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the end it all started to look like an oviedo sporting at first 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 A lot of tension 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.200
 because yesterday the tartiere returned to live the closest thing to a derby
