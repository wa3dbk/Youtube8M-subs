00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.670
 everyone is coming back today with 

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.470
 a new video so that's the video 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.720
 day in my skin special tattoos 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.980
 so there it is noon I go to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.200
 13 hours so we'll go from there to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.759
 24:30 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.339
 I targeted myself I'm going you are not 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.349
 the usual yes but that's kind 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.830
 four months that I was panicked suddenly 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:22.919
 it's a bit weird him I see 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 my apprehension for the moment i 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.640
 not seen yet my model ends so I have 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.990
 a little bit afraid of that I have not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.220
 necessarily afraid of hurting because I 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.829
 know the pain if the time 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.960
 so it should not be that should 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.950
 to be bearable what but that's actually 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.410
 I'm afraid the model does not please me 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.510
 no or so here is something that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.940
 like a scream game happened it's a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.960
 thing actually I think what we're getting 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.520
 says it's especially when we keep any 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.780
 his life and I think that's what makes me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.700
 goes on the nose but continues all his life 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.740
 imagine silva little she will not you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.210
 hide it all your life unless you 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.020
 to do the laser and to have a lot of pain 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.510
 this is besides elsewhere i've been seeing on 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.370
 internet the poop I missed some stuff 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.590
 is not to do he does not have so much 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.400
 that they are missed or still 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 luckily I have friends who have me 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.880
 inevitably facebook week that have me 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.320
 reassured by saying that they had 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.580
 knowledge to them that had already been 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.670
 chef made sun who was very good 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.260
 so it reassured me a little already but I 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.940
 think you have are more is it going to go there 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.320
 the more I'm going to stress it's normal 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.050
 especially when I'm on the table in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 the city with the maximum stress in all 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.070
 case thank you for everything small 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.490
 follow on instagram including kits 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 thank you very much 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 so here you have between all the whole 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 throughout the day you will see 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.470
 everything that's going on I do not think that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.550
 I will have the right to film but I will 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 would say that tonight after that how 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.040
 happened 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.510
 so here you feel it must not be too much 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.890
 complicated it's a writing with a 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.080
 symbol in the first letter 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.310
 so it's not like it's like 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.990
 big thing that took all the back that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.030
 was super complicated just a writing 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.500
 on the wrist what a lot there I did 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.910
 arms on them you see 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.200
 here I hope this video with me 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.910
 all day long you will like it and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.530
 then being a bit ahead of a 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.150
 half an hour are debating over and a half and 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.540
 which enemies we practically do 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.360
 stopped we decided to go to the store 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.520
 who has a story side to extend my 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.720
 brother here is there cazala low-normans I 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.800
 think 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.800
 Mouassa has three girls 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.650
 hello so suddenly what happened 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 is that I had an appointment at 13h but 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.670
 I arrived at 12:50 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.069
 not because the store opens and also 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.120
 at 13h so in fact they opened a 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.939
 little bit later he was a player and 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.349
 because so the girl asked me to go 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.719
 to see her she showed me the model that 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.250
 she had drawn it and she asked me 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.530
 so basically if I like it so me that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.469
 I liked almost the spanking she 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.019
 prepared the room she had made it a 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.519
 layer of the shot after she placed me so 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.159
 she asked me to put my wrist 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.299
 on the table she placed the calq and 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.739
 blow after there is more to do the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.939
 outline us first what they do 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 is that they clean you up a little bit 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.859
 and then after that, what did I do 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.909
 I was not scared I was scared before 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.489
 when she started with her gills 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.739
 frankly it was going pain do not know 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.969
 not you then in fact it's 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.349
 exactly as some have said 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.939
 it's like it's a wound of 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.560
 cats except that these faults to charge the 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.599
 whoever catches you all the time and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.609
 who do not stop so it's not very 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.019
 nice at first frankly at the beginning 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.579
 me it's not so bad and more loving and 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.439
 in wrist bone and the more it made me 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.790
 wrong 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.639
 it's bearable but it's true that the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.650
 beginning is difficult but after the body 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.479
 gets used to it and the more it goes in time 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.150
 and peace be here and the less you have pain in 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:39.349
 ultimately it lasts and maybe twenty 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.699
 minutes I think he spent a lot 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.019
 of time on the demer after the narrative 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.729
 the writing was very very fast 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.400
 so it's going to cost as you said 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.930
 80 euros so she advised me to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.329
 care then two 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.260
 the cards therefore copy I am better 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.090
 want to serve the bioderma that has here ya 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.019
 then by then you have to put the bay 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.489
 Pantene so it's this one here at 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.170
 put six times a day it takes 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:09.859
 always that the tattoo is moisturize 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:11.540
 and it has to vibrate and basically it 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.680
 must end if its crust should not 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.459
 that you dream the crusts because 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.079
 apparently it can be catastrophic 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.329
 so that must come down all 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.530
 only frankly I will tell you 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.940
 about if you want to make yourself a 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.019
 tattoo must not be afraid of the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900
 pain I assure you it's 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.070
 really so really not necessarily 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.360
 bearable and I can quite 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.400
 understand the people you know they get 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.810
 do several tattoos but as a result 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.979
 of that because but because it's 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.050
 really here it is really 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.820
 unbearable what good is the thing that 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.500
 can prevent him from getting a tattoo 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.820
 it is if you could envy at the end 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.130
 of a certain time obviously must 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.570
 choose a good model sorry I look 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.349
 a bit moreover via steam at 40 on the 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.419
 course with my bag 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.250
 so here you go anyway 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.270
 much more relaxed and or besides I 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.340
 wanted to thank all the girls 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.349
 he sucks on instagram and on facebook 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.430
 since on facebook you have been 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.320
 many had already put on instagram 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.909
 commented thank you very much for 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.590
 followed in there it really made me 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.960
 pleasure and it gave me courage 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.760
 so here's a little bit of it 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.599
 so me what I love is the writing 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.070
 dream 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.260
 so it's pretty difficult to you 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.780
 show something on the wrist but so 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.050
 here is basically what is a V with a key 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.580
 integrated ground and so something that continues 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.740
 by the uimm the meaning she is 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.909
 very simple I am passionate about 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.650
 music and I have always dreamed of being 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.960
 singer not singer day it's the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.220
 arm but singer even see in the 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.389
 like the holidays the effect of music 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.340
 small communes and for that I have 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.320
 always dreamed of being a singer what and 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.270
 precisely the dream and the little key of 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.560
 So it was my dream what is my dream 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.270
 to become a singer simply 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.919
 at first I wanted to put a microphone but 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.000
 a microphone it was too complicated blow 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.199
 I preferred the floor key which is 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.289
 much more basic is much more 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.820
 simple so that's my little 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.800
 personal tattoo and I am very 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.820
 very happy especially that the wrist I 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.520
 finds that it's an area that can 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.960
 So here really easily and then 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.070
 for now it is a little inflated so 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.979
 that I have the impression that the features of the 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.479
 sous anyway really damn 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.580
 marked in fact compared to the rest 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.139
 but 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.310
 but here you go if it deflates and then 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.599
 anyway told me that in three 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.280
 weeks I had to go back to see if 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.860
 it heals is sorry I have 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.449
 wrong to say that word and who had 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.460
 retouches that it was gift what so 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.199
 so frankly it's a 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.599
 experience to do dance know that I 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.530
 find it nice and I invite you to 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.909
 do it if you feel like it 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.409
 wait a while anyway for 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:19.030
 unless it is a year of reflection 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.539
 I was going to say of reflection this is it 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.979
 much better 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.419
 a time for reflection the story of 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.969
 to be sure of yourself but otherwise it's 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.169
 really something nice so 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.430
 here I hope this little video 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.169
