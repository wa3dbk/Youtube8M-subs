you<00:00:32.270> can<00:00:32.390> also<00:00:32.509> take<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.960> rope<00:00:33.110> way<00:00:33.289> or<00:00:33.500> drive

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
you can also take the rope way or drive

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.200 
you can also take the rope way or drive
up<00:00:34.039> if<00:00:34.820> you're<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:35.239> inclined<00:00:36.820> okay<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:37.880> we've

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
up if you're so inclined okay so we've

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.080 
up if you're so inclined okay so we've
made<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:38.690> about<00:00:38.900> halfway<00:00:38.960> up<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:40.550> hiking<00:00:40.700> path

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
made it about halfway up the hiking path

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.930 
made it about halfway up the hiking path
and<00:00:41.770> well<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.800> would<00:00:43.010> say<00:00:43.160> hiking<00:00:43.550> path<00:00:43.730> but

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
and well I would say hiking path but

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.520 
and well I would say hiking path but
it's<00:00:44.060> really<00:00:44.149> a<00:00:44.270> paved<00:00:44.510> trail<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:45.260> follows

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
it's really a paved trail that follows

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.490 
it's really a paved trail that follows
the<00:00:45.649> road<00:00:46.000> we're<00:00:47.000> coming<00:00:47.329> from<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.110> south

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
the road we're coming from the south

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.330 
the road we're coming from the south
entrance<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:50.030> believe<00:00:50.390> if<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.320> come<00:00:51.620> from<00:00:51.950> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
entrance I believe if you come from the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.639 
entrance I believe if you come from the
other<00:00:52.460> side<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.790> can<00:00:52.940> actually<00:00:53.120> hike<00:00:53.450> up<00:00:53.660> the

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
other side you can actually hike up the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.110 
other side you can actually hike up the
side<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.010> mountain<00:00:55.399> here<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.730> actually

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
side of the mountain here it's actually

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.990 
side of the mountain here it's actually
a<00:00:56.180> little<00:00:56.390> easier<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.010> can<00:00:58.160> see<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.610> the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
a little easier and you can see the the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.229 
a little easier and you can see the the
view<00:00:59.270> it's<00:00:59.660> kind<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.930> hazy<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:04.729> even<00:01:05.089> down

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
view it's kind of hazy and even down

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.489 
view it's kind of hazy and even down
here<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:07.630> valley<00:01:08.630> but<00:01:08.899> I<00:01:09.079> kind<00:01:09.439> of

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
here we have a valley but I kind of

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.770 
here we have a valley but I kind of
imagined<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.700> know<00:01:10.819> lava<00:01:11.240> used<00:01:11.389> to<00:01:11.539> flow

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
imagined that you know lava used to flow

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.809 
imagined that you know lava used to flow
down<00:01:11.959> there<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.499> there's<00:01:12.770> really<00:01:12.979> cool<00:01:13.310> you

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
down there and there's really cool you

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.690 
down there and there's really cool you
know<00:01:13.909> rock<00:01:14.359> formations<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.319> stuff<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.459> maybe

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
know rock formations and stuff so maybe

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.889 
know rock formations and stuff so maybe
you<00:01:16.880> will<00:01:16.969> head<00:01:17.149> down<00:01:17.359> for<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:18.350> little<00:01:18.499> bit<00:01:19.899> see

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
you will head down for a little bit see

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.330 
you will head down for a little bit see
if<00:01:20.929> we<00:01:21.079> find<00:01:21.319> anything<00:01:21.590> interesting

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
if we find anything interesting

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.819 
if we find anything interesting
all<00:01:23.240> right<00:01:23.420> here<00:01:24.380> we<00:01:24.469> go<00:01:25.569> so<00:01:26.569> we<00:01:26.990> came<00:01:27.200> down<00:01:27.439> and

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829

you<00:01:27.889> can<00:01:28.310> see<00:01:28.490> old<00:01:28.850> lava<00:01:29.299> flow<00:01:34.450> also<00:01:35.450> we<00:01:35.689> can

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
you can see old lava flow also we can

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:59.719 
you can see old lava flow also we can
see<00:01:36.170> some<00:01:36.560> volcanic<00:01:37.099> rocks<00:01:37.899> it's<00:01:38.899> really<00:01:39.259> cool

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

okay<00:02:19.960> we've<00:02:20.170> hyped<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.190> top<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.840> small

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
okay we've hyped to the top of a small

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.840 
okay we've hyped to the top of a small
peak<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.570> can<00:02:25.720> see<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> view<00:02:26.850> we

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
peak here and you can see the view we

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.910 
peak here and you can see the view we
were<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.090> told<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.540> gases<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.560> coming<00:02:29.709> out

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
were just told that gases are coming out

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.580 
were just told that gases are coming out
of<00:02:30.040> volcanoes<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.730> need<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.970> go<00:02:31.060> back<00:02:31.590> so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
of volcanoes so we need to go back so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.140 
of volcanoes so we need to go back so
that<00:02:32.709> what<00:02:32.920> that's<00:02:33.220> what<00:02:33.430> happens<00:02:33.730> at<00:02:33.850> all<00:02:33.880> so

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
that what that's what happens at all so

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.180 
that what that's what happens at all so
if<00:02:34.270> gases<00:02:34.630> come<00:02:34.810> out<00:02:34.990> everyone<00:02:35.860> needs<00:02:36.100> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
if gases come out everyone needs to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.390 
if gases come out everyone needs to
evacuate<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:36.940> they're<00:02:37.150> toxic<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:39.160> now<00:02:39.340> we

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
evacuate because they're toxic so now we

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.190 
evacuate because they're toxic so now we
have<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.730> go<00:02:39.820> back<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.690> see<00:02:40.840> some<00:02:41.020> gas

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
have to go back you can see some gas

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.250 
have to go back you can see some gas
coming<00:02:41.470> out<00:02:41.590> over<00:02:41.709> there

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
coming out over there

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.540 
coming out over there
but<00:02:44.260> yeah<00:02:44.350> if<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.860> chance<00:02:45.040> also<00:02:45.430> is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
but yeah if you have the chance also is

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.620 
but yeah if you have the chance also is
