00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello guys who is the channel's easy gamer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 about games bringing another monkey to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.630
 and this time I'm bringing plate aop 2 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.400
 once again on the channel today, guys 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 I'm bringing a new zombie mode 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.410
 called meat that you are the zombie and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.970
 When the game starts you have to find 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.789
 the cure what is the cure cure is the port not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 may be more is a power off that stays 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.570
 floating type is the maximum are here osp 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 500 earned 1 by now adding anyone 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.030
 come human and for whom the match wins 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.750
 who has more points every second 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.700
 that I stay alive I earn 20 points and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.480
 each sumbe that the sea won 100 points 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.430
 that's where we win without points and it's a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.579
 very fast start and it rains in 26 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.579
 minutes 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:12.420
 dung and a person gets survivors 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 only the problem occurs fast and it is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 very difficult to stay alive in the game 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:35.119
 because you have a gun and the floor swap 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:38.759
 of weapons game a new exactly the game 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.549
 only that the problem is that every weapon that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.979
 you take without making that animation that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.320
 She's taking the gun out of the world pocket when 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 you are 27, you have to take the bullet if 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.570
 scroll to it 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.030
 now you see adin arise, hence the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.079
 Drug animation is this block and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 animation on back 27 27 and it looks like like 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:07.140
 that in the meantime this animation is tefÃ© 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.490
 street because I was in 2 1 billion and can not really 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.100
 kill 2005 but only it is 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:18.970
 arrested that survivor who if there for 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.400
 Who wants it here where I was for sale? 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.130
 When you come 21 min you can not kill 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.160
 two with a gun I just have to kill one 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.580
 and then I just got a new one and that was it. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.850
 so I do not know much the tips to give 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.630
 this game mode because the fourth time I 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:42.640
 game up - is very fast so does not have 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.900
 how long I stay alive and think 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:54.150
 picking up a single is not staying too long and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:58.540
 exchange says unb to survivor 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.970
 I like people, I 'll say you are 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.910
 honest, it's cool to play with 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.580
 friends of the other 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.610
 just that alone is annoying thought through so 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:17.200
 not funny 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:18.640
 jung without a rotten weapon at first and at least 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.120
 minus two humans 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.380
 yesterday the two play as one or two 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.900
 humans and I think it 's cooler than 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.870
 I think it's boring or you're a zombie. 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.140
 especially in the middle of the other type with 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:42.340
 four people I do not know a year again 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.920
 Sorry, let's say you're playing. 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.690
 that dynamic mode has eight people 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:56.770
 four people are zombies that neither is 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:04:01.050
 super fast and quotas by then 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:06.910
 human rather than die first with 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:09.760
 the floor and the second was to give 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.900
 I think it's much cooler because it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.170
 here is something I find annoying 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.540
 It did not work out in my time, there's no time. 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.419
 the sheikh still the idea was good but 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.930
 I know they should have thought 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.169
 A little more about being a lonely person 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:33.070
 so it's cool to play a stop 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:40.630
 drop shot and beads to almost 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:43.960
 almost damn how I survived that 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:50.690
 Look At The Poor Civil Buzz Leg 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.940
 kill this is no mistake when 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.410
 I was on the floor 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.630
 I could not catch but I had 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.970
 taken before and I think it has a 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.850
 red power pop green 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:12.949
 Ours is happy and it was only me who read it. 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:14.690
 a boot here are now paulo a tv 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.510
 red the red 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.070
 when you a bis can get him the 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:25.760
 I see myself as a human being and also 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.760
 other map and the least evil is within a 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.500
 apartment and played very little 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.630
 survives to where you train so far 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.630
 were on the ground to try to 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.770
 bit of the map that is too big has to 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.449
 keep giving these policies here 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.320
 I managed to survive trying not to fall into 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.560
 fire 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.669
 I dribbled Leandro one of an airplane 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.999
 He gave me a beautiful pedal. 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:56.439
 take a shower here orange fanta and where 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:06:00.849
 the guy inside the restaurant 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:06.399
 sahy to him that he hoped to do 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:13.509
 animation of your weapon and it can pick up 30 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:23.379
 seconds with a bullet only button 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:37.869
 The guys what is this? 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:39.789
 second still two and then that's it 

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:42.909

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.800
