00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 Hi everyone, all right 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.330
 well then in today's video I'm going to talk 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.340
 one thing I never thought I would 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.609
 would approach a day that like everyone else or 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 Most of you know Apple has released the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.119
 iphone 5 but then I've been arguing with 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 my friends and making my conclusions 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 I discovered that apple is not 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 revolutionizing as before 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.379
 apple ipad ipod threw all 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.660
 very cool and very affectionate products 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 Let's say like this but a few times to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 here and do not have people who are confused that the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 season i steve jobs died 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.690
 it's not because steve jobs died is that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 I do not know, they can always be active 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:06.210
 but because they evolutionary othon the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.229
 products ipad 2 ipad 3g iphone 4s is handset 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 5 ipod touch 5 and all products are 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.720
 following the same order of products nothing 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 revolutionary type thing 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.280
 I was going to get over that legal will launch the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.909
 iphone today I want to buy 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.520
 That's cool, but then I've been doing it. 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 my comparisons and really the galaxy 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.479
 3 looks better 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.299
 it's actually better than the iphone 5 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.610
 because besides being 200 reais cheaper 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.860
 which is what I suppose happened 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 because it can not be the calamity that neither 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.380
 the iphone 4s that was 3 thousand reais here in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 Brazil the galaxy s 3 has much more 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.520
 functionality than it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.829
 and not to mention the new pine style that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.579
 they implemented on that new iphone is 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.369
 there ne 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.149
 to alerj if this one of 30 pins if not 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.430
 I'm mistaken 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.219
 they put one of 8 because they 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.619
 they said ah did not need both the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.600
 pins because occupied much space and 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.750
 most of them 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.209
 was not used there they invent format 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.310
 completely new pin not yet 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.680
 have any apple products 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.220
 including I do not even think of ipod touch 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.489
 5 and they do not even give themselves the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.180
 put an adapter that they have created from 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.160
 30-pin to 8-pin or if you 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.390
 want to use this style of pina here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.890
 You'll have to buy an adapter. 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.180
 that 's 99 dollars there and a hundred and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.370
 real here 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.650
 ie you lose your aip gui your doc 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.730
 loses all these things just because of 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.160
 plugins and for example I 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.890
 I have three adapters to charge 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.200
 iphone ipad and ipod each came with one 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.049
 for example if I buy one now 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.850
 iphone 5 i will not be able to use any 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.209
 of these boots I'm going to have to stay 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.920
 carrying the new path to everything 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.319
 not to mention that it is not everyone who 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.260
 go buy the iphone 5 then you have 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.930
 that really honda an adapter for 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.079
 Everywhere this goes to the house. 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.769
 his friend and his friend also has a 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.269
 apple device but it's not the 5th at this 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.459
 will have to be carrying a charger 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.519
 for every place not to say you can use the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.890
 his friend's career and s3 he does not have 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.049
 if I am not mistaken or micro usb that is 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.420
 a super normal cable that you find 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.180
 on all non-Samsung devices 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.120
 but almost all because apple is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.040
 take advantage of their boys ' fans, 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.290
 celebrities who buy any minimum 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.959
 that they make the products 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.620
 I can be considered more or less 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.040
 a fanboy because I have the most part 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.970
 of products of which is the macbook ipad 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.660
 ipod iphone but I'm not fanboy 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.670
 crazy I get buying updating 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.160
 all of them according to any new 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.109
 update that they do without mentioning that 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.390
 now that apple is noticing that 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.459
 she was losing more squares behind 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.480
 competitors so it has not always been 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.519
 one of the best 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.209
 companies including I think 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.090
 which is the best but they think 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.240
 since s4 they are implementing 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.460
 several functions that they noticed in the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.900
 jailbreak devices 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.300
 for example, now six 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.560
 the two options to send a tweet or 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.240
 send or update status on facebook 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.699
 which is something that already had in several 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.840
 tweets you found in cid too 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:50.539
 how did I not have everything and did not 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.690
 I do not know, do not disturb me, that's it. 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.419
 they launched what they already had 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.400
 also like a tweet in cydia okay 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.919
 that they may be with a lack 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.100
 of creativity but their actions 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.870
 increased their expectation is the 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.820
 increase because of all the famous 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.990
 because if everyone stops for 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.150
 think 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.400
 you can clearly see that the products 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.699
 of them does not have much difference with 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.919
 competitors even with correction up to 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.300
 more customizable for example in the 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.270
 android market 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.330
 applications are cheaper than 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.030
 for ael s for example noel is if the 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.930
 angry birds you pay with 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.910
 dollars number is not paid 99 cents and 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.060
 android market advice does not pay anything 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.650
 It's free between the complete box and you 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.039
 you also do not need to have this 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.440
 developer account and pay 70 and 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.930
 A few dollars a month is okay. 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.080
 apple wins so bigger then because it is 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.960
 very influential and I never told you 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.270
 does not understand the blog and also hardware 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.460
 they are improving well but they are 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.050
 dating many versions to do 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.530
 these updates 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.740
 this is the bid them gain more 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.680
 money by lengthening the versions they 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.440
 they will do it because they plan everything 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.720
 ahead of time for example there are four 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.210
 years ago, at least they must have 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.389
 finished the idea of ​​how the 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.160
 iphone 5 and were only making changes and 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.129
 improvements according to bonuses that 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.129
 happened on the iphone 4s 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:31.110
 only launch today 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:34.559
 So that's my personal opinion. 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.080
 about the new iphone and the galaxy s 3 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:39.569
 I think I'll stay with the galaxy. 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.969
 I really like the iphone talma I want 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:45.119
 test other views and other levels 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:47.729
 from other companies and it may be that I 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.499
 I like it well then it was not I hope 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.479
 did you like the video of a 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:53.969
 young favorite to help 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.889
 and if you liked it too that it is 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:57.899
 very important is the time to stop 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.599
 post videos lately because like me 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:04.469
 said I was in testing week and 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:08.449
 notes of these things but now I finish 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:08.449
 So, thanks.
