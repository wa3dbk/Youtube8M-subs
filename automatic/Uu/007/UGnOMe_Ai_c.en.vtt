and thinking outside the box and
bringing<00:00:15.089> product<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.780> that's<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.049> we

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
bringing product out and that's what we

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.510 
bringing product out and that's what we
were<00:00:16.199> excited<00:00:16.410> about<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.890> other<00:00:17.039> people<00:00:17.369> can

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
were excited about what other people can

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.330 
were excited about what other people can
do<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:23.930> this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.650> concept<00:00:26.250> that's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
do with it this is just a concept that's

to<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> what's<00:00:45.780> special<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to that what's special about it is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
to that what's special about it is
touchscreen<00:00:47.190> itself<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> touchscreen

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
touchscreen itself the touchscreen

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.580 
touchscreen itself the touchscreen
actually<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.780> made<00:00:48.930> out<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.320> alternative

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
actually is made out of an alternative

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.959 
actually is made out of an alternative
material<00:00:50.160> call<00:00:50.370> flm<00:00:51.239> RX<00:00:51.660> sense<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.379> propriety

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
material call flm RX sense of propriety

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.100 
material call flm RX sense of propriety
alternative<00:00:53.969> IPO<00:00:54.300> solution<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.930> it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
alternative IPO solution so it's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.020 
alternative IPO solution so it's
actually<00:00:55.410> based<00:00:55.530> off<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> copper<00:00:56.399> metal<00:00:56.910> mesh

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actually based off of copper metal mesh

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
actually based off of copper metal mesh
technology<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.649> key<00:00:59.129> advantage<00:00:59.520> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
technology and the key advantage of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
technology and the key advantage of
metal<00:01:00.000> mesh<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.109> lower

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
metal mesh is that is as lower

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
metal mesh is that is as lower
resistance<00:01:01.920> compared<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> traditional<00:01:02.820> ideal

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
resistance compared to traditional ideal

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
resistance compared to traditional ideal
solution<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.530> any<00:01:04.739> market

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
solution that's that you have any market

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.789 
solution that's that you have any market
today<00:01:05.189> you're<00:01:05.580> able<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.439> bend<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> or

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
today you're able to actually bend it or

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
today you're able to actually bend it or
curve<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.549> copper<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.540> ductile

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
curve it because copper is more ductile

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
curve it because copper is more ductile
more<00:01:10.140> malleable<00:01:10.350> versus<00:01:10.950> idea<00:01:11.250> which<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> very

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
more malleable versus idea which is very

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.690 
more malleable versus idea which is very
brittle<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.240> once<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> bend<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.990> breaks<00:01:13.700> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
brittle so once you bend it it breaks so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
brittle so once you bend it it breaks so
you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.909> create<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> curved<00:01:15.720> surface<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.229> one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you can create a curved surface in one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
you can create a curved surface in one
dimension<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:17.280> addition<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.790> actually

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
dimension in addition you can actually

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
dimension in addition you can actually
create<00:01:18.240> larger<00:01:18.720> screens<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.439> because

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
create larger screens as well because

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
create larger screens as well because
it's<00:01:19.950> low<00:01:20.220> resistance<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.240> actually

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it's low resistance you can actually

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.010 
it's low resistance you can actually
stretch<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> 17<00:01:22.650> inches<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.520> any

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
stretch up to 17 inches and not have any
