00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Unfortunately, I did not fix the moment 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.020
 unscrewing the drain bolt on honda cb 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.360
 900 but most honda in general 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 most certainly the Danish system 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.980
 Japanese motorcycles are basically 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.269
 similar procedure 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.330
 is at the bottom of the lowest point 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.760
 engine slim and oil which 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 unscrewed and after that you warmed up 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
 motorcycle it's all done you warm up 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 a motorcycle he stood for you several 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.960
 minutes you waited further painful 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.960
 death a little mask settled 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.070
 enough so that she did not have time to cool down and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.370
 it was still living but it was not already 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.630
 quite hot we expose 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.110
 motorcycle over some small 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.690
 bright you can see I found here 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.960
 small hole 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.630
 Substitute a wash or on it for 2 thousand 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.660
 the lid cut inside 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.460
 This is here the plotla glass itself from climbing under 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.369
 the engine itself and find the lowest 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.990
 drain bolt points 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.690
 it's hard enough not to notice here 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.250
 you see a little dripping here 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.410
 unscrew the drain bolt he pop up 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.380
 under the pressure of liquid oil and falls into 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.009
 our set bucket 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 all the oil is drained at this moment is important 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.650
 remember that bolt 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.720
 we need it if possible 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.280
 it needs time to remove before 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.940
 will merge oil before he 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.320
 you will fall hot motives me 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.540
 Sorry it didn't work out right now 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.810
 so I will soon be looking there on 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.970
 taiwan oil is removed we wait while she 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.690
 merge all the great pressure then she 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.990
 gradually slower miller would be useful 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.420
 a little shake the bike to stand here 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.580
 10-15 minutes we do not have you therefore 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 enough to merge everything in principle 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.159
 no residue will be possible 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 old oil you will stay but it is not 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.479
 especially critical of him there will be miserable 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.220
 percentage but therefore it is not scary 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.549
 I would like to draw your attention to 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.150
 that the oil change should be on the manual 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.799
 do not ride the old oil 5 8-10 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
 Thousands of kilometers I think that everything is fine 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.200
 it is not worth the oil that is only on 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.700
 three thousand kilometers traveled and more 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.650
 it is recommended by the manufacturer 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.900
 motul motul seven hundred 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.830
 so he becomes after seven 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.469
 eight thousand run therefore merge this 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.969
 slush necessarily 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.069
 also when changing the oil is always changing 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.650
 oil filter 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.090
 after you have drained all the oil you 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.150
 find your oil filter you have it 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.480
 must already be purchased in advance 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.400
 must know his model in advance to order 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.530
 Its usually ours to order to 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.810
 then suddenly I had a week 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.400
 Here it is assumed that the filter in the machine and 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.629
 you already have oil in style 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.959
 you find where you have me as a couple on 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.000
 most fund it ahead on others 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.340
 motorcycle models can be different 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.620
 somewhere may be below somewhere I know 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.299
 there is on kawasaki on the body from 50 ninja 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.139
 he is inside at all in the engine 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.969
 my belly is twisted here 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.489
 oil filter or unscrew by hand and 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.810
 either an oil filter remover or 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.849
 just pass through a long fat 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.169
 screwdriver unscrew his screwdriver he 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.169
 we will never be useful again 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:42.859
 you can either choose from us or click here 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:45.049
 so key is some kind of oil residue we have 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.040
 in any case, it will still be itself 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.290
 oil filter 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.030
 not to paw not to cover the pipes 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.370
 because then it will all burn 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.220
 when the heat is worth something 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.720
 to enclose 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.610
 here and unscrew the oil 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.420
 and here we see run down 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.420
 with oil filter 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.100
 Here we have a matrix 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.770
 here neatly wipe everything we wait for now 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.169
 from here it seems to bend and we will cook 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.169
 new before pouring more 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.810
 before twisting the new oil 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.280
 filter 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.700
 freed we do it earlier than 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.820
 pour oil 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:48.130
 but before you turn the car is worth it 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.740
 frame become first pour it a pie 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.740
 oil lubricate it completely with oil and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.630
 grease don't forget this here's gum 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.040
 that is, you can brush your finger in march 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.240
 Here's the gum that goes 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.010
 the circumference of the oil filter in order 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.919
 so he stuck 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.200
 more strongly to her place here she is 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.180
 engine 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.620
 motul we have seven hundred four-stroke 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.620
 remove the growth is 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:38.490
 Here is the new fresh oil 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.480
 very different from the old 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.480
 as far as you remember 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:05.509
 and coat the gum 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.100
 actually key but we have indoor 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:34.199
 hand to the end is no longer necessary in general 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.199
 it's enough 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.900
 wipe after spun to 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.460
 then when we start the engine 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.630
 look not flowing and we out of 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.630
 oil filter oil 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.320
 and we are now dry now remaining 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.650
 how much we have on the manual 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.110
 shaking liters we fill the engine 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.320
 we find the cover of the oil infusion 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.400
 neck it is usually on the side of the engine and and 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.960
 hard not to notice 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:14.160
 introduce ourselves to the dam and not lose 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.420
 it will come in handy for us to spin 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.780
 and fill engaged only we need 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.780
 butter 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:39.319
 where the oil is whipped not to buy spin
