00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
trying to put on size so it mean it's a

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.060 
trying to put on size so it mean it's a
good<00:03:18.790> idea<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.290> especially<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.980> know

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
good idea to especially you know

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.370 
good idea to especially you know
sometimes<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.329> bulk<00:03:22.600> your<00:03:23.049> body<00:03:23.200> fat

sometimes when you bulk your body fat

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.080 
sometimes when you bulk your body fat
percentage<00:03:23.440> can<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:23.980> out<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.100> control<00:03:24.310> so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
percentage can be out of control so
