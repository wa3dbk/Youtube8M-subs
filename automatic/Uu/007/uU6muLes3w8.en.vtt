00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
which is around 5,000 rpm it goes

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.760 
which is around 5,000 rpm it goes
without<00:04:33.310> any<00:04:33.759> fuss<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.360> really<00:04:34.960> is<00:04:35.080> one<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.680> the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
without any fuss it really is one of the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.090 
without any fuss it really is one of the
best<00:04:35.979> aspects<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:37.000> Jaguar<00:04:37.419> XF<00:04:38.009> well<00:04:39.009> the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
best aspects of this Jaguar XF well the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.590 
best aspects of this Jaguar XF well the
mid-range<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.550> pretty<00:04:39.789> punchy<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.270> because

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
mid-range is pretty punchy and because

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.570 
mid-range is pretty punchy and because
so<00:04:41.050> 8-speed<00:04:42.010> gearbox

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
so 8-speed gearbox

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.210 
so 8-speed gearbox
you<00:04:43.240> really<00:04:43.570> are<00:04:43.780> never<00:04:44.050> found<00:04:44.260> wanting<00:04:45.010> in

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
you really are never found wanting in

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.969 
you really are never found wanting in
the<00:04:45.280> wrong<00:04:45.520> gear<00:04:45.820> because<00:04:46.979> electronics

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
the wrong gear because electronics

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.650 
the wrong gear because electronics
really<00:04:48.340> work<00:04:48.490> hard<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:49.030> get<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.389> in<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.539> right

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
really work hard to get you in the right

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.150 
really work hard to get you in the right
way<00:04:49.720> at<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.020> right<00:04:50.050> time<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.560> gas<00:04:50.710> changes

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
way at the right time and gas changes

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.770 
way at the right time and gas changes
are<00:04:51.280> very<00:04:51.520> very<00:04:51.729> effortless<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.300> very<00:04:52.479> quick

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
are very very effortless and very quick

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.810 
are very very effortless and very quick
well<00:04:53.289> these<00:04:53.470> panel<00:04:53.860> ships<00:04:54.070> really<00:04:54.280> add<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.729> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
well these panel ships really add to the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.170 
well these panel ships really add to the
sense<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.240> drive<00:04:55.570> involvement<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:57.180> don't

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
sense of drive involvement and I don't

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.939 
sense of drive involvement and I don't
think<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.419> lot<00:04:58.570> of<00:04:58.690> drivers<00:04:59.229> will<00:04:59.410> actually<00:04:59.770> end

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
think a lot of drivers will actually end

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.070 
think a lot of drivers will actually end
up<00:05:00.039> using<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.970> last<00:05:01.180> two<00:05:01.389> gals<00:05:01.570> okay<00:05:01.810> number

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
up using the last two gals okay number

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.050 
up using the last two gals okay number
seven<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.500> eight<00:05:02.710> unless<00:05:03.340> they<00:05:03.669> are<00:05:03.760> going<00:05:03.970> to

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
seven and eight unless they are going to

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.490 
seven and eight unless they are going to
use<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.449> paddle<00:05:04.750> shift<00:05:04.900> automatically<00:05:05.440> I

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
use this paddle shift automatically I

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.810 
use this paddle shift automatically I
don't<00:05:05.740> think<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:05.949> car<00:05:06.099> will<00:05:06.220> ever<00:05:06.400> ship<00:05:06.580> into

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
don't think the car will ever ship into

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.370 
don't think the car will ever ship into
them<00:05:06.970> when<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.240> are<00:05:07.360> driving<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.750> around<00:05:07.960> town

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
them when you are driving it around town

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.740 
them when you are driving it around town
on<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.340> highway<00:05:09.849> there's<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.210> lot<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.539> grip

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
on the highway there's a lot of grip

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.909 
on the highway there's a lot of grip
from<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.020> tires<00:05:11.229> which<00:05:11.470> means<00:05:11.680> when<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.889> want

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
from the tires which means when you want

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.010 
from the tires which means when you want
to<00:05:12.070> push<00:05:12.250> this<00:05:12.400> car<00:05:12.460> into<00:05:12.849> corners<00:05:13.180> it<00:05:13.720> always

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
to push this car into corners it always

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.230 
to push this car into corners it always
has<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.370> confidence<00:05:15.370> inspiring<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:15.970> very

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
has that confidence inspiring and very

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.850 
has that confidence inspiring and very
predictable<00:05:16.680> handling

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
predictable handling

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.100 
predictable handling
well<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.580> steering<00:05:18.940> offers<00:05:19.300> decent<00:05:19.930> amount

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
well the steering offers decent amount

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.529 
well the steering offers decent amount
of<00:05:20.169> feel<00:05:20.500> it's<00:05:21.070> not<00:05:21.280> as<00:05:21.490> fearsome<00:05:22.030> as<00:05:22.150> maybe

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
of feel it's not as fearsome as maybe

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.680 
of feel it's not as fearsome as maybe
say<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.870> 5<00:05:23.199> Series<00:05:23.440> from<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.919> BMW<00:05:24.430> but<00:05:24.690> it's

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
say a 5 Series from a BMW but it's

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.629 
say a 5 Series from a BMW but it's
pretty<00:05:25.930> decent<00:05:26.159> it's<00:05:27.159> pretty<00:05:27.370> good<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.610> fact

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
pretty decent it's pretty good in fact

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.939 
pretty decent it's pretty good in fact
and<00:05:28.180> I'm<00:05:28.479> just<00:05:28.630> nitpicking<00:05:28.990> right<00:05:29.199> now<00:05:29.349> but<00:05:29.830> it

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
and I'm just nitpicking right now but it

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.860 
and I'm just nitpicking right now but it
actually<00:05:30.099> is<00:05:30.370> pretty<00:05:30.669> good<00:05:30.789> and<00:05:31.180> with<00:05:31.690> this

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
actually is pretty good and with this

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.890 
actually is pretty good and with this
agile<00:05:32.409> and<00:05:32.620> really<00:05:33.520> dynamic<00:05:33.970> chassis<00:05:34.150> you

agile and really dynamic chassis you

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.360 
agile and really dynamic chassis you
will<00:05:35.050> enjoy<00:05:35.260> driving<00:05:35.590> this<00:05:35.680> kind<00:05:35.830> pushing<00:05:36.280> it

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
will enjoy driving this kind pushing it
