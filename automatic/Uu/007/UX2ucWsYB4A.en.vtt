deep in there for about three or so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
deep in there for about three or so
hours<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> regular<00:00:24.330> kind<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
cooking time for a turkey and then we'll

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.990 
cooking time for a turkey and then we'll
see<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> survives<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.010> note<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
see if it survives so note that when I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
see if it survives so note that when I
did<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> cake<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> iphone

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
did this with the cake with the iphone

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.299 
did this with the cake with the iphone
5s<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.790> baked<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> iphone<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> cake<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.309> for

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
5s I baked the iphone in a cake and for

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
5s I baked the iphone in a cake and for
it<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.489> only<00:00:35.670> 40<00:00:35.940> minutes<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.680> 475

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it was only 40 minutes but it was on 475

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880 
it was only 40 minutes but it was on 475
I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.540> survived<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.770> going

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I think and it survived so this is going

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
I think and it survived so this is going
to<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.180> 325<00:00:42.180> degrees<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
to be 325 degrees so it's kind of a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.639 
to be 325 degrees so it's kind of a
lower<00:00:45.090> temperature<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> normal

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lower temperature but that's the normal

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
lower temperature but that's the normal
you<00:00:46.770> know<00:00:47.180> under<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> instructions<00:00:48.960> that's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
you know under the instructions that's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.360 
you know under the instructions that's
what<00:00:49.320> you're<00:00:49.440> supposed<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.250> is
