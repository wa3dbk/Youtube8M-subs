consider not eating it because it is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
consider not eating it because it is
less<00:01:35.640> than<00:01:36.060> optimal<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.170> answer<00:01:37.470> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
shakes in the middle of winter with the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529

but<00:02:10.080> there's<00:02:10.289> also<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.800> argument<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
but there's also the argument that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.790 
but there's also the argument that
eating<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.849> frozen<00:02:12.060> foods

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
eating a lot of frozen foods

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.320 
eating a lot of frozen foods
disrupts<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> bacteria<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.180> your<00:02:14.270> stomach

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
disrupts the bacteria in your stomach

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330 
disrupts the bacteria in your stomach
and<00:02:14.810> stops<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.350> from<00:02:15.380> being<00:02:15.560> able<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.100> absorb

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
and stops you from being able to absorb

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.990 
and stops you from being able to absorb
as<00:02:16.490> much<00:02:16.550> b12<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.320> whole<00:02:18.500> issue<00:02:18.830> here<00:02:19.400> but

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
as much b12 it's a whole issue here but

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.850 
as much b12 it's a whole issue here but
there<00:02:20.150> are<00:02:20.330> ways<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.600> kind<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.050> lessen<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
there are ways to kind of lessen the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.440 
there are ways to kind of lessen the
damage<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.370> eating<00:02:22.580> frozen<00:02:22.760> fruit<00:02:23.120> for

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
damage of eating frozen fruit for

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.410 
damage of eating frozen fruit for
example<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.050> if<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:25.130> number<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:25.580> saw<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
example so if you number one saw the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.420 
example so if you number one saw the
fruit<00:02:26.960> before<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.560> eat<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.340> do

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
fruit before you eat it so you can do

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.710 
fruit before you eat it so you can do
this<00:02:28.520> by<00:02:28.670> actually<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.180> letting<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.480> sit<00:02:29.630> on

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
this by actually just letting it sit on

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.230 
this by actually just letting it sit on
your<00:02:29.840> countertop<00:02:30.260> or<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:31.400> can<00:02:31.580> pour<00:02:31.820> hot

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
your countertop or you can pour hot

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.240 
your countertop or you can pour hot
freshly<00:02:32.690> boiled<00:02:32.960> water<00:02:33.260> over<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.740> which<00:02:34.100> will

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
freshly boiled water over it which will

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.340 
freshly boiled water over it which will
thought<00:02:34.520> even<00:02:34.880> quicker<00:02:35.090> sometimes<00:02:35.960> I<00:02:36.110> do<00:02:36.170> this

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
thought even quicker sometimes I do this

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.810 
thought even quicker sometimes I do this
for<00:02:36.560> salad<00:02:36.830> dressings<00:02:36.860> because<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.520> don't<00:02:37.730> want

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
for salad dressings because I don't want

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.240 
for salad dressings because I don't want
to<00:02:37.970> eat<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> big<00:02:38.540> frozen<00:02:39.110> veggie<00:02:39.770> meal<00:02:39.950> so

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
to eat a big frozen veggie meal so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.040 
to eat a big frozen veggie meal so
thawing<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> beforehand<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.360> be<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> real<00:02:41.870> help

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
thawing it beforehand can be a real help

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.140 
thawing it beforehand can be a real help
the<00:02:42.830> second<00:02:43.160> thing<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.550> do<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.880> thought

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the second thing you can do is thought

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.610 
the second thing you can do is thought
and<00:02:44.330> something<00:02:44.690> like<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.840> Vitamix<00:02:45.320> where<00:02:45.500> if

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and something like a Vitamix where if

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.500 
and something like a Vitamix where if
you<00:02:45.740> blend<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.160> long<00:02:46.340> enough<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.820> will<00:02:47.150> thought

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
you blend it long enough it will thought

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.090 
you blend it long enough it will thought
naturally<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> point<00:02:48.710> where<00:02:48.740> it's<00:02:48.980> not

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
naturally to a point where it's not

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.160 
naturally to a point where it's not
absolutely<00:02:49.490> freezing<00:02:49.940> cold<00:02:50.300> but<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.020> also

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
absolutely freezing cold but it also

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.260 
absolutely freezing cold but it also
doesn't<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.830> be<00:02:51.950> warm<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.970> third

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
doesn't have to be warm and the third

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.690 
doesn't have to be warm and the third
way<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.540> just<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.200> second<00:02:54.710> up<00:02:54.860> eat<00:02:55.130> something

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
way is just a second up eat something

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.640 
way is just a second up eat something
frozen<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.450> frozen<00:02:56.960> texture<00:02:57.320> and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
frozen with the frozen texture and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.430 
frozen with the frozen texture and
cuddle<00:02:58.010> up<00:02:58.100> by<00:02:58.460> your<00:02:58.760> wood<00:02:59.000> stove<00:02:59.300> should<00:03:00.290> you

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
cuddle up by your wood stove should you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440
