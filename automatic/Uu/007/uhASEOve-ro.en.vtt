00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello and welcome to this crowd 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.290
 is the recipe of the day and sokoto 100 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 hectares for two people 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.480
 we need 4e centilitres of cream 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.640
 liquid 200 g of saint nectary two 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.529
 slices of white ham salt and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 pepper 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.300
 first step we will put the liver 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 after heated to 200 degrees we go 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.310
 now put the cheese to melt 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 in the cream I still keep two 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.820
 three pieces of cheese 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 so that will make silpro small pieces 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 match of course I listened to the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.460
 cheese before putting it in the cream 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.800
 I will cut strips of ham 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.350
 the cream is very smooth pepper game I 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 pour the cream cheese in the bottom of my 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 arm cardoon even me I took mini 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
 casseroles because it's so cute 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.270
 for the presentation then 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.270
 I add ham strips but they 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.449
 the rest of the leg straps or the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.939
 little dice of cheese that I kept 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.830
 and most importantly I do not forget to salt and 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.090
 pepper and that's actually I'm asking a 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.979
 paper to the foundation not just 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.450
 to prevent all these little ones 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.350
 ramekins and the dish clash 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 happily while cooking 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 it's gone for 5 to 10 minutes 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 baking 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.160
 in fact you have to watch the waters 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 mates to get the perfect cooking 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.390

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.120
 monitor well to make sure we have a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120
 homogeneous cooking 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.850
