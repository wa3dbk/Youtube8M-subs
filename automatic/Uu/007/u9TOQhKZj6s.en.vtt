00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
wood from the inside out so often you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
wood from the inside out so often you
can<00:00:45.300> find<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> wood<00:00:46.559> sounds<00:00:46.980> Hollow

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
can find that the wood sounds Hollow

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.120 
can find that the wood sounds Hollow

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
we call mud or shelter tubes and these

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110 
we call mud or shelter tubes and these
are<00:00:52.590> protective<00:00:53.129> tunnels<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> termites

are protective tunnels that the termites

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
are protective tunnels that the termites

not the only insects that swarm ants
also<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.170> swarms<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.399> important<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> be
