00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.109 
that you can see that binds the band
together<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> unlike<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
together and this is unlike the one that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.910 
together and this is unlike the one that
I<00:01:33.299> use<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> can

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I use that I really like and as you can

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
I use that I really like and as you can
see<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.450> hard<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> plastic

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
see it's a it's really hard and plastic

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.160 
see it's a it's really hard and plastic
and<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:38.369> tends<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> snag<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:39.930> hair

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and that tends to kind of snag my hair

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830 
and that tends to kind of snag my hair
and<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.500> these<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:41.310> last<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.909> long<00:01:42.060> okay

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and also these don't last as long okay

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
and also these don't last as long okay
so<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.320> those<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.610> back<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so I don't like those now going back to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
so I don't like those now going back to
the<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.240> prefer<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.630> off-brand<00:01:46.290> from

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the one that I prefer the off-brand from

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.710 
the one that I prefer the off-brand from
the<00:01:46.680> Dollar<00:01:46.860> Tree<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.420> very

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
