so<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.900> be<00:02:01.020> honest<00:02:01.230> i'd<00:02:01.380> i'd<00:02:01.620> say<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.160> this

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
so to be honest i'd i'd say that this

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.460 
so to be honest i'd i'd say that this
looks<00:02:02.730> more<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.150> cobblestone<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.320> this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
looks more like cobblestone and this

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.490 
looks more like cobblestone and this
looks<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.830> stone<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> yeah<00:02:07.170> that's<00:02:07.380> just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
looks like stone but yeah that's just

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.290 
looks like stone but yeah that's just
the<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.980> it<00:02:08.490> looks<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.000> cool

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the way it is it looks really cool

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.160 
the way it is it looks really cool
either<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:10.640> yeah<00:02:11.640> again<00:02:11.910> guys<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.420> 66<00:02:12.960> p

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
either way yeah again guys this is 66 p

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.710 
either way yeah again guys this is 66 p
I<00:02:13.380> think<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.070> dollar<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.390> not<00:02:15.510> really

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I think or one dollar so it's not really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.630 
I think or one dollar so it's not really
that<00:02:16.200> much<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.710> if<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.010> want<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.280> buy<00:02:17.610> it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that much so if you do want to go buy it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.210 
that much so if you do want to go buy it
is<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.420> 60<00:02:18.990> p<00:02:19.170> or<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:20.040> dollar<00:02:22.010> yeah<00:02:23.010> it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
is is 60 p or one dollar yeah it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.800 
is is 60 p or one dollar yeah it's
really<00:02:23.460> good<00:02:23.640> i<00:02:23.700> would<00:02:23.970> recommend<00:02:24.390> buying<00:02:24.570> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
really good i would recommend buying it

all the blocks look like and you
probably<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.360> think<00:03:18.510> there's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.750> trial<00:03:19.050> version

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
probably I think there's a trial version

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.750 
probably I think there's a trial version
of<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.100> actually<00:03:20.280> go<00:03:20.550> into

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
just a really cool really cool texture

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.990 
just a really cool really cool texture
pack<00:05:48.960> if<00:05:49.190> if<00:05:50.190> you're<00:05:50.400> looking<00:05:50.699> for<00:05:50.729> something

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
pack if if you're looking for something

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.520 
pack if if you're looking for something
that<00:05:51.150> it's<00:05:51.270> kind<00:05:51.479> of<00:05:51.569> like<00:05:51.720> John<00:05:52.020> Smith<00:05:52.319> or

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
that it's kind of like John Smith or

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.140 
that it's kind of like John Smith or
dokucraft<00:05:53.039> was<00:05:53.400> like<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.669> is<00:05:53.819> probably<00:05:54.030> the

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
dokucraft was like this is probably the

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.779 
dokucraft was like this is probably the
closest<00:05:54.509> thing<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:56.310> know<00:05:56.430> just<00:05:56.669> because

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
closest thing you know just because

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.249 
closest thing you know just because
there's<00:05:57.120> really<00:05:57.150> two<00:05:57.479> texture<00:05:57.870> packs<00:05:58.050> out<00:05:58.139> at

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
there's really two texture packs out at

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.779 
there's really two texture packs out at
the<00:05:58.319> moment<00:05:58.440> unless<00:05:58.919> you<00:05:59.099> accounting<00:05:59.550> the

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
the moment unless you accounting the

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.390 
the moment unless you accounting the
Mass<00:06:00.270> Effect<00:06:00.300> one<00:06:00.780> as<00:06:00.900> well<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.860> mass<00:06:02.069> effect

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
Mass Effect one as well the mass effect

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.399 
Mass Effect one as well the mass effect
then<00:06:02.639> there<00:06:02.849> is<00:06:02.970> three<00:06:03.300> but<00:06:03.539> if<00:06:03.810> you're<00:06:04.050> kind

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
then there is three but if you're kind

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.439 
then there is three but if you're kind
of<00:06:04.470> just<00:06:04.530> texture<00:06:05.039> packs<00:06:05.220> then<00:06:05.490> is<00:06:05.849> too<00:06:06.090> and

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
of just texture packs then is too and

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.420 
of just texture packs then is too and
yeah<00:06:07.139> this<00:06:07.319> is<00:06:07.440> probably<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.740> closest<00:06:08.069> one<00:06:08.190> to

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
yeah this is probably the closest one to

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.510 
yeah this is probably the closest one to
that<00:06:08.639> to<00:06:08.970> kind<00:06:09.599> of<00:06:09.720> John<00:06:10.020> Smith<00:06:10.340> kind<00:06:11.340> of

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
that to kind of John Smith kind of

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.450 
that to kind of John Smith kind of
