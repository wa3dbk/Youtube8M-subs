00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.020

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 today I decided to write to you're like 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.530
 It's what I do so I already had it today. 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.920
 started but the soil and flooded 1 in 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.710
 some are shorter than broke 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.900
 these two here broke and today alexei 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.619
 Yes, I'll do the following, I'll go 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:36.090
 pick up this cuticle winner from 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:37.680
 I can risquÃ© lines that show the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.670
 match 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 I can only leave so she 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.469
 I'm the only woman with that here too but I 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 I like to put a little cotton on it teaches 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:57.480
 I have a little stick for him. 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.600
 group in a thousand 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 like this 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.089
 after I did this it did not impose 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.630
 I'll wait a little bit for 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.630
 soften the cuticle 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.850
 Now that I 've lost weight, I 've already lost weight. 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.030
 I'll take one by one and I 'll do it in a tone 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 normal I take the title I stayed I was 16 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.180
 I think about four months five months in 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.970
 pull cuticle 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.539
 but that's it but I had to push her 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 every week because moisturize right 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.920
 every day also only that there is still a lot 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.140
 I work to do this, I do not 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.950
 I managed to keep and I took the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.659
 cuticle 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.240
 But I got a little political so it's 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.030
 Calm down, I'll push the type here. 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.330
 floating but nothing good I'll do it in the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.490
 Two hands I go back to show the bikes. 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.470
 that I'll use 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.990
 I'm afraid to take the cuticle 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.080
 I have already laid the foundation for advancing the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.110
 I used this one, give it to me. 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.950
 call the hard line 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.780
 she has clove oil, I used her 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.189
 I'm liking her and have used only her. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.920
 because my fingernail 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.620
 she walks very weak breaking a lot 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.769
 easy and she's leaving my hour 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.340
 I belong here, it's a delicacy. 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:24.049
 tapioca take a little kiss and have us 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.570
 Your camera will have bright lights and 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.790
 Maybe I'll make a little detail of it. 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.400
 with these two here golden and black but 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.400
 I'll still see it is decided. 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.210
 today good people now I finished 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.240
 Enamel in June I passed three names 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.620
 of those montilla that he is very clear I 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.560
 I'll try to do a little detail that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.640
 15 paiva to use this golden enamel that is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.720
 a chrome noble gold shading faith 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.770
 line parties and sic of colorama that 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:44.080
 dark glasses special effects merry 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:51.340
 a normal toothpick and I'll get the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:54.900
 enamel with the tip of the toothpick and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.900
 it re-stamped here in my 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.940
 I'm going to change the way you are. 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.420
 I'm casting a ball the size that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.420
 I want to 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.330
 a little glaze for you to do 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.850
 this step because if the enamel had 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.669
 still if he has it still 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.760
 can stick to the glaze that you 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.090
 passed from base and another with black enamel 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.729
 and a little toothpick like that 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:57.840
 I 'll make an outline around 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.520
 of each ball I did bullfight is 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.419
 foot shaking the camera a lot because the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.419
 memory table 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.970
 dirt containing toothpick and I'll do 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.970
 A lot but you've been giving it a try. 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.630
 from one side of the other to the other 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:48.320
 people I finished painting I passed 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.720
 this extra brightness here they are that in 30 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.150
 seconds I always like to go and 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.820
 then he still finished with a semblant 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.650
 a drying spray saying I just tried 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.400
 all the lines just left the one of 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.070
 Dino to clean with you but the enamel 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.490
 Light is very quiet. I like to clean. 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.190
 and was using this note paper the 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.680
 tablet one of us but to clean myself 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.410
 I like to use wood as acetone 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:24.860
 the egg does not stick better is the sauce born 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:29.900
 on the button more gogol I shot the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:36.080
 excess is not to ruin the enamel 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:38.750
 I'm going through the little strips like this until 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:44.380
 remove all the enamel that is here by 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.380

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.009

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.640
 the clarinet enamel a detail of a sim 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:15.300
 is pretty simple right because it has not much 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.660
 practice to make a decorated nail but I 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.660
 liked it 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:28.259
