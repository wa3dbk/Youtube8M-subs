00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.350
 with the captain grow and let's see it 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.050
 deep intoxication flame gives us 87 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.360
 thousand 88 thousand beds practically give us 2 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.370
 millions of experience and only 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.560
 It consists of collecting 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.080
 10 bottles of marine rum any monkey 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.800
 account can not be hard 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.690
 for a maximum of 10 minutes or 15 minutes 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.240
 and well you will see how easy it is 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.310
 make it 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 also at the entrance of the abyss base 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.799
 before going down there are two other missions 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 that is so it would be good if it is in 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.750
 group here relieve you can go 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 doing as they are killing you 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.470
 can finish the custom mission 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.899
 that are killing with your team and you go 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.510
 taking experience that are these two 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.790
 one with gustavo eiffel 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.410
 I could attract mechanical congresses 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.170
 in search of mechanical grams is called 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.050
 Crabbing I'm already going in search of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.860
 those in the tool boxes 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.550
 let's see the one about crab fishing 143 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.560
 a thousand beds and five stacks of steam see 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.180
 this note another 88 thousand beds two 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.830
 million experience but it gives us 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.300
 estimated batteries is also up to two 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.580
 millions of experiences in it 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.860
 but I forget to say it and 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.890
 good if you set these steam piles 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.170
 see are in average price to 25 thousand each 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.460
 one we go down to either of the two 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.970
 rooms that we have if we have them 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.830
 and nothing, how are the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.200
 typists after killing me throw me 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.050
 march income forgive me crab no 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.010
 march grams is called and how is it 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.750
 they get the tool boxes 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.980
 killing these that are those of the strike 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 I think that's what those strike calls are 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.970
 killing him the sandra cycle that are the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.970
 fat those who throw themselves dogs 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.170
 and good with everyone you kill there I think 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 that 50% chance of drugging 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.810
 could be about 5 or 6 mod 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.940
 and nothing waiting 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.150
 keep an alarm here to get ready 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.740
 and well nothing that can come if you're 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.390
 multi accounts because you have much more 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.280
 easy they would last making the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.100
 transmissions let's say a half hour and 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.290
 with each character one is taking out 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.210
 sum of 230 30,000 beds daily that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.670
 yes we do it a week with already 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.140
 practically in the are the missions you 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.050
 you are making the money from the fertilizer and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.140
 last a maximum of half an hour apart from 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.200
 that you give him dax apart from the fact that 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.150
 experience your characters do not look here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.740
 in a moment I already collect five 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.010
 good bottles I went to the room that did not 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.010
 was 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.240
 I picked 5 bottles and they see that it's super 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.280
 brief does not last anything 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.910
 this mission for the mono accounts 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.330
 recommendable is alone although although yes 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.830
 yes they have enough friends to do the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.140
 same missions can be put in 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.050
 agreement and come as a group and do all 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.120
 the transmissions in a single moment 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.140
 let's go to the other room to go to 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.140
 collect that there is more 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.260
 look at these are the others that remain 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.260
 toolboxes the cycles will put 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.750
 and nothing because it does not last anything since I've already 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.180
 repeated several times but it's like that 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.590
 are two very brief missions there are 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.260
 be aware that in several rooms there 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.060
 slightly hidden bottles 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.920
 and well nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.720
 this little tip of beds wanted 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.720
 remind them that this is not done 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.600
 millionaire but if they apply several per day 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.510
 they can make you the support of the fertilizer 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.520
 or something you need 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.350
 and nothing I hope you liked and we 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.350
 we see in the next guys goodbye
