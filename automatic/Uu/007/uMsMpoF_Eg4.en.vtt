00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.330
 then I am ill more to drain it in 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.220
 welcome to this little one 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.840
 update of the multiplayer series 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.010
 that cue skirts at least enough 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.480
 central 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.219
 as you can see I have thrown a lot of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 so I made some other looks 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 here the under cs are going to position themselves and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.100
 arrive directly in the party of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.710
 sorting here it is all this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.050
 merdaccia I'll show you a little 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:33.380
 what i did this is the tower is over 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:37.350
 boy is this my mill tower 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.079
 solar panels other mills there is the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 mobs poses that you already know 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.250
 what do all this do 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.370
 repower energy goes down here 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.610
 but all so and feed these five 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.949
 watch first engines that feed 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 these are the energy act on energy 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.610
 cells that go to feed 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.500
 I'll do something else now 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.379
 see the rest but oh well here is there 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.890
 you already know everything is sorting 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.250
 connected to solar panels up there here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.869
 brings us the mini crafting cars 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.549
 houston 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.570
 here it is that they go directly to this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.150
 and her chest here then you you to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.220
 I said this energy of bull kraft 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.220
 is brought here 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.280
 where for now they generate with 16 thousand already 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.880
 m joule is generated from a robson cube 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.860
 the lava that ends here 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.730
 this is a stone ma hump generator 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.150
 Now it is stopped because it is not filled to the 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.980
 magma blue cross that is brought here 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.380
 inside 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.240
 here we reactivate this thing and go 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.700
 look at some problems then i can 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.190
 ask for advice by activating this 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.170
 here the lava flows with these new pipes 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.619
 fantastic 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.020
 here it is and we create obsidian for 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.820
 pick up the iron 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 you already saw in my video here 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.340
 all hidden wait 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.380
 but there is a nice sorting for the col 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.910
 that ends 6 in excess the coc ends 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.740
 in here and then I go back inside it 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.720
 sorting down there takes the iron 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.090
 no this takes the iron excuse me and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680
 down here iron becomes style and it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.739
 bring in here 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.739
 obviously the oil comes from below 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.380
 then I moved or pop pop 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.120
 or move this recco machines 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.130
 present self-sufficient as you see 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 continue to it I had it stuck for 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.710
 see if this panel island was enough for me 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.540
 but he seems to make it 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:05.670
 I moved how beautiful this is here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:14.040
 re cycle production 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:19.530
 and excuse me for krapp, here it is 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.120
 end up in here and create us or mac 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.130
 I stopped with the iridium I was four 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.720
 stack I don't do anything anymore 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.720
 Excess skype ends up in here 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.260
 fantastic 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.000
 here there are gods there is a nothing clone 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.340
 this is my update for the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.850
 multiplayer series then I will fill this 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 small room or the jetpack ds and it is though 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.630
 this little room I am asking you though 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.490
 an advice 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.920
 watch it ray as you see me 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.370
 basically since a while I see that 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 there is a bug I do not charge well chunk 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.959
 see that the world is not there 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.620
 problem that if I open another server a 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.860
 case my private or watch 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.500
 away or a sp 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.510
 the rei is large we say 10 x 10 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.730
 while in this case official that me 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.980
 charge only flies around 3x3 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.690
 around me and I do not charge others 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.390
 the moment he loads those others 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.090
 my a praise you see those others then 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.070
 I ask the people of youtube please 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.290
 only answer who really knows 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.180
 something do not make me hypothesis why 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.910
 otherwise the comments of athens 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.420
 illegible if you know what 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.030
 it is and 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.540
