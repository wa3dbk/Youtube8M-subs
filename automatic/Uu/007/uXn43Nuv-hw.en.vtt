double master rated that's correct
awesome<00:00:12.059> beauty<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> few<00:00:12.960> moves<00:00:13.259> today<00:00:13.530> we're

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
awesome beauty a few moves today we're

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.200 
awesome beauty a few moves today we're
going<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> talk<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.490> bit<00:00:14.849> about<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
going to talk you a little bit about the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.210 
going to talk you a little bit about the
physics<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.809> Figure<00:00:16.139> Skating<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.859> think

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
physics of Figure Skating I think

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.859 
physics of Figure Skating I think
probably<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.760> best<00:00:17.850> way<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> start<00:00:18.359> off<00:00:18.510> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
probably the best way to start off is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.540 
probably the best way to start off is
with<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> basic<00:00:19.560> edges<00:00:19.890> you're<00:00:20.279> talking

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
with the basic edges you're talking

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.890 
with the basic edges you're talking
about<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> edges<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.119> my<00:00:21.240> skate<00:00:21.510> oh<00:00:21.720> yeah

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
about the edges on my skate oh yeah

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900 
about the edges on my skate oh yeah
alright<00:00:22.500> people<00:00:23.010> don't<00:00:23.279> realize<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
alright people don't realize that the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.759 
alright people don't realize that the
the<00:00:23.939> bottom<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.630> blade<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.140> flat<00:00:25.470> it's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the bottom of the blade is not flat it's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
the bottom of the blade is not flat it's
actually<00:00:26.099> hollowed<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.720> little

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
actually hollowed out so it's a little

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050 
actually hollowed out so it's a little
bit<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> u-shape<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.760> were<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> look

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
bit of a u-shape so if you were to look

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.700 
bit of a u-shape so if you were to look
down<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.480> blade<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> would<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> hollowed

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
down the blade you would see a hollowed

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
down the blade you would see a hollowed
out<00:00:31.800> place<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.669> gives<00:00:32.910> us<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
out place and that's what gives us the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
out place and that's what gives us the
different<00:00:33.510> edges<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> gives<00:00:34.200> us<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> grip<00:00:34.710> on

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
different edges and gives us the grip on

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
different edges and gives us the grip on
the<00:00:34.980> ice<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:35.880> trying<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.600> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the ice so what we're trying to get is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
the ice so what we're trying to get is
to<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> body<00:00:37.469> leaning<00:00:37.829> towards<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to have the body leaning towards the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340 
to have the body leaning towards the
center<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> circle<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.020> we're<00:00:40.230> making

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
center of the circle that we're making

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.670 
center of the circle that we're making
slightly<00:00:40.920> leaning<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.210> edge

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
slightly leaning into that one one edge

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.540 
slightly leaning into that one one edge
and<00:00:43.680> we're<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> hold<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and we're just going to hold that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010 
and we're just going to hold that
position<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.660> we're<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> go

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
position for now so we're going to go

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.979 
position for now so we're going to go
push<00:00:46.289> toe<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> heel<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> hold<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> outside

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
push toe to heel and hold that outside

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
push toe to heel and hold that outside
edge<00:00:49.700> now<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:50.910> we're<00:00:51.090> doing<00:00:51.210> edges

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
edge now when we're doing edges

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
edge now when we're doing edges
consecutively<00:00:52.260> down<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> line<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.039> after

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
consecutively down the line one after

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.660 
consecutively down the line one after
the<00:00:53.430> other

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the other

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
the other
we<00:00:54.510> also<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> add<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.230> arm<00:00:55.410> move<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> we

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
we also have to add an arm move in so we

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
we also have to add an arm move in so we
would<00:00:57.239> wait<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> halfway<00:00:58.230> point<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.890> our

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
would wait to the halfway point of our

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.299 
would wait to the halfway point of our
half<00:00:59.219> circle<00:00:59.699> switch<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> arms<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.410> bring

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
half circle switch the arms and bring

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.520 
half circle switch the arms and bring
the<00:01:02.430> foot<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.730> front<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> next<00:01:03.629> push<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the foot in front for the next push so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
the foot in front for the next push so
we'd<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.860> alternating<00:01:05.369> feet<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.210> right

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
we'd be alternating feet that way right

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
we'd be alternating feet that way right
there<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.439> there<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
there you go there you go what so this

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
there you go there you go what so this
is<00:01:11.159> chiara<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.060> she's<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.570> doing<00:01:12.659> his

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
is chiara so she's going to be doing his

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.590 
is chiara so she's going to be doing his
spiral<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.640> she's<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> riding<00:01:15.299> on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
spiral and she's going to be riding on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.200 
spiral and she's going to be riding on
the<00:01:16.290> left<00:01:16.560> outside<00:01:16.860> edge<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> see

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the left outside edge and you can see

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
the left outside edge and you can see
the<00:01:18.360> lean<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> circle<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.220> nice

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the lean into the circle that was nice

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
the lean into the circle that was nice
you<00:01:20.939> want<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> try<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> backward<00:01:21.990> outside

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you want to try a backward outside

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.080 
you want to try a backward outside
spiral<00:01:23.040> we're<00:01:23.310> working<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.759> angular

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
spiral we're working with angular

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.679 
spiral we're working with angular
momentum<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:25.710> using<00:01:26.210> force<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.540> we're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
momentum and we're using force so we're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
momentum and we're using force so we're
creating<00:01:27.990> force<00:01:28.470> through<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> big<00:01:29.340> muscles

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
creating force through the big muscles

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
creating force through the big muscles
between<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.240> knee<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.900> hip<00:01:30.960> joint<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
between the knee and the hip joint so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
between the knee and the hip joint so
where<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> force<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.610> created<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> then

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
where the force is created and then

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
where the force is created and then
we're<00:01:33.840> transferring<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> force<00:01:34.740> through<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
we're transferring the force through the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.940 
we're transferring the force through the
lower<00:01:35.430> part<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> leg<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.119> ankle<00:01:36.329> joint

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
lower part of the leg and ankle joint

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.700 
lower part of the leg and ankle joint
and<00:01:37.950> we're<00:01:38.130> pushing<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.420> circle<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and we're pushing on to a circle so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.560 
and we're pushing on to a circle so
we're<00:01:40.829> creating<00:01:41.009> angular<00:01:41.549> momentum<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
we're creating angular momentum as you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.359 
we're creating angular momentum as you
bend<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> ankle<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.040> edge

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
bend the ankle more and the edge

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
bend the ankle more and the edge
tightens<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:46.110> blade<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.530> starts

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
tightens up your blade actually starts

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.399 
tightens up your blade actually starts
to<00:01:47.009> move<00:01:47.220> faster<00:01:47.729> across<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.479> ice<00:01:48.600> okay<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
to move faster across the ice okay and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.660 
to move faster across the ice okay and
so<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> next<00:01:50.040> principle<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.520> we'll

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so that's the next principle that we'll

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
so that's the next principle that we'll
get<00:01:50.880> into<00:01:51.030> spinning<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:51.780> what's<00:01:52.079> creating

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
get into spinning that's what's creating

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
get into spinning that's what's creating
our<00:01:53.159> rotational<00:01:53.759> momentum<00:01:53.909> before<00:01:54.450> we

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
our rotational momentum before we

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.359 
our rotational momentum before we
started

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
started

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.370 
started
awesome<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.359> when<00:01:56.509> she<00:01:56.600> was<00:01:56.719> spitting<00:01:56.899> we<00:01:57.170> saw

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
awesome so when she was spitting we saw

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.410 
awesome so when she was spitting we saw
she<00:01:57.649> got<00:01:57.799> faster<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:58.909> she<00:01:59.000> came<00:01:59.149> out<00:01:59.390> a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
she got faster and then she came out a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.149 
she got faster and then she came out a
little<00:01:59.659> bit<00:01:59.840> slowed<00:02:00.170> down<00:02:00.469> how<00:02:00.890> does<00:02:01.039> that

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
little bit slowed down how does that

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.219 
little bit slowed down how does that
work<00:02:01.340> well<00:02:01.909> what<00:02:02.179> happens<00:02:02.539> is<00:02:02.689> once<00:02:02.929> she

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
work well what happens is once she

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.469 
work well what happens is once she
creates<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.340> rotational<00:02:04.789> momentum<00:02:04.939> on<00:02:05.329> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
creates the rotational momentum on the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.959 
creates the rotational momentum on the
entry<00:02:05.899> edge<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.439> she<00:02:06.710> starts<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.159> spin<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
entry edge and she starts the spin the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.460 
entry edge and she starts the spin the
only<00:02:08.179> force<00:02:08.420> that's<00:02:08.690> really<00:02:08.899> acting<00:02:09.229> on<00:02:09.349> her

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
only force that's really acting on her

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.250 
only force that's really acting on her
there<00:02:09.679> at<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.580> point<00:02:10.849> is<00:02:11.030> friction<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:12.019> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
there at that point is friction of the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.650 
there at that point is friction of the
blade<00:02:12.440> against<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.769> ice<00:02:12.950> okay<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.910> she<00:02:14.390> pulls

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
blade against the ice okay so she pulls

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.080 
blade against the ice okay so she pulls
her<00:02:14.780> arms<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.830> lowers<00:02:16.459> them<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.910> she

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
her arms in and lowers them and she

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.789 
her arms in and lowers them and she
pulls<00:02:17.299> her<00:02:17.390> free<00:02:17.720> leg<00:02:17.900> that's<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.260> one<00:02:18.410> not<00:02:18.650> on

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
pulls her free leg that's the one not on

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.860 
pulls her free leg that's the one not on
the<00:02:18.950> ice<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.340> closer<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.480> axis<00:02:20.810> of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the ice in closer to the axis of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.410 
the ice in closer to the axis of
rotation<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:22.160> what's<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.430> that's<00:02:22.849> doing<00:02:23.269> is

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
rotation so what's that that's doing is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.660 
rotation so what's that that's doing is
decreasing<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.379> moment<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.739> inertia<00:02:25.040> which

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
decreasing the moment of inertia which

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.190 
decreasing the moment of inertia which
is<00:02:25.700> increasing<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.599> rotational<00:02:27.140> velocity

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
is increasing the rotational velocity

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.740 
is increasing the rotational velocity
right<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:28.519> when<00:02:28.670> she<00:02:28.849> comes<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.360> she

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
right so then when she comes up she

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.470 
right so then when she comes up she
opens<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.319> body<00:02:30.620> parts<00:02:31.010> which<00:02:31.700> increases

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
opens up the body parts which increases

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.569 
opens up the body parts which increases
the<00:02:32.660> moment<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.019> inertia<00:02:33.260> which<00:02:33.950> decreases

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
the moment of inertia which decreases

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.789 
the moment of inertia which decreases
the<00:02:35.180> rotational<00:02:35.690> velocity<00:02:36.170> which<00:02:36.290> allows<00:02:36.590> her

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
the rotational velocity which allows her

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.229 
the rotational velocity which allows her
to<00:02:36.829> push<00:02:37.190> out<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.610> spin<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.090> nice

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
to push out of the spin in a nice

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.190 
to push out of the spin in a nice
controlled<00:02:38.569> manner

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
controlled manner

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080 
controlled manner
this<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.650> Ashley<00:02:40.099> Clark<00:02:40.310> who<00:02:40.549> is<00:02:40.579> joining<00:02:40.910> us

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
this is Ashley Clark who is joining us

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.699 
this is Ashley Clark who is joining us
now<00:02:41.269> she's<00:02:41.599> another<00:02:41.959> professional<00:02:42.500> skater

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
now she's another professional skater

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.259 
now she's another professional skater
here<00:02:43.010> at<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.250> yerba<00:02:43.459> buena<00:02:43.579> ice<00:02:43.819> rink<00:02:44.120> and

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
here at the yerba buena ice rink and

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.789 
here at the yerba buena ice rink and
she's<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.959> demonstrate<00:02:45.110> some<00:02:45.530> jumps

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
she's going to demonstrate some jumps

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:46.390 
she's going to demonstrate some jumps
for<00:02:45.980> us<00:02:46.069> now

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
for us now

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.740 
for us now
I<00:02:46.430> mean<00:02:46.610> jumps<00:02:46.910> are<00:02:47.030> just<00:02:47.180> spins<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.629> air

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
I mean jumps are just spins in the air

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.690 
I mean jumps are just spins in the air
backsons<00:02:48.440> Nia<00:02:48.829> great<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.250> once<00:02:49.400> you're<00:02:49.610> in

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
backsons Nia great and once you're in

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.819 
backsons Nia great and once you're in
the<00:02:49.790> air<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.420> principles<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.200> projectile

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
the air the principles of projectile

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.319 
the air the principles of projectile
motion<00:02:52.010> take<00:02:52.340> over<00:02:52.610> okay

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
motion take over okay

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.850 
motion take over okay
so<00:02:53.480> basically<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.079> launch<00:02:54.290> yourself<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
so basically you launch yourself in the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.380 
so basically you launch yourself in the
air<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.040> you're<00:02:55.129> now<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> projectile<00:02:55.819> okay

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
air and you're now a projectile okay

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.119 
air and you're now a projectile okay
what<00:02:56.690> does<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.840> mean<00:02:57.170> that's<00:02:57.319> how<00:02:57.500> I'm<00:02:57.590> scary

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
what does that mean that's how I'm scary

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.210 
what does that mean that's how I'm scary
tile<00:02:58.970> all<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.329> projectile<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.680> any<00:03:01.069> object

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
tile all the projectile is is any object

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.890 
tile all the projectile is is any object
moving<00:03:01.700> through<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.060> air<00:03:02.239> where<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.660> only

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
moving through the air where the only

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.289 
moving through the air where the only
force<00:03:03.260> acting<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:03.859> is<00:03:04.400> gravity<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.060> so

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
force acting on it is gravity and so

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.440 
force acting on it is gravity and so
jumps<00:03:05.840> occur<00:03:06.620> on<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.010> parabola<00:03:07.430> which<00:03:08.180> means

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
jumps occur on a parabola which means

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.699 
jumps occur on a parabola which means
the<00:03:08.630> symmetrical<00:03:09.109> on<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.290> way<00:03:09.380> up<00:03:09.530> and
