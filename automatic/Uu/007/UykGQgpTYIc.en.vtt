how to take your drawings and turn them
into<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.430> pattern<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.360> all<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.720> things<00:00:50.930> that

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
into a pattern and all the things that

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.030 
into a pattern and all the things that
you<00:00:51.199> can<00:00:51.350> do<00:00:51.530> with<00:00:52.220> that<00:00:52.400> pattern<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:54.040> for

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
you can do with that pattern and for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.759 
you can do with that pattern and for
this<00:00:55.160> workshop<00:00:55.610> I<00:00:56.050> went<00:00:57.050> through<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.440> I<00:00:57.500> found

in the corner of this one page and we're
going<00:01:03.979> to<00:01:04.040> use<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:04.810> we're<00:01:05.810> going<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.020> turn

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to use this we're going to turn

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.140 
going to use this we're going to turn
this<00:01:06.290> into<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.620> pattern<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.190> then<00:01:07.880> I'm<00:01:08.000> going

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
this into a pattern and then I'm going

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.580

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
can turn this little sketch into several

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.080 
can turn this little sketch into several
different<00:01:12.830> kinds<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.369> three-dimensional

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
different kinds of three-dimensional

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.560 
different kinds of three-dimensional
puppets

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
how to turn a two-dimensional design

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.360 
how to turn a two-dimensional design
into<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.450> three-dimensional<00:01:24.170> drawing<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.710> in

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
into a three-dimensional drawing and in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.980 
into a three-dimensional drawing and in
our<00:01:25.490> last<00:01:25.700> section<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:26.270> showed<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.840> how<00:01:26.960> to

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
our last section I showed you how to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.900 
our last section I showed you how to
take<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.470> design<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.190> turn<00:01:28.370> it<00:01:28.490> into<00:01:28.640> these

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
take a design and turn it into these

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.510 
take a design and turn it into these
patterns<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.750> now<00:01:30.740> I'm<00:01:30.920> going<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.190> start

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
patterns and now I'm going to start

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.150 
patterns and now I'm going to start
showing<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.060> how<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.390> turn<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.160> pattern

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
showing you how to turn that pattern

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.030 
showing you how to turn that pattern
into<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.640> wooden<00:01:35.540> puppet

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.310 

in<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.430> first<00:01:39.670> one<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.210> showed<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.140> how<00:01:41.290> to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
in the first one we showed you how to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.980 
in the first one we showed you how to
take<00:01:41.560> your<00:01:42.190> sketches<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.360> turn<00:01:43.540> it<00:01:43.690> into<00:01:43.840> a

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
take your sketches and turn it into a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.290 
take your sketches and turn it into a
front<00:01:44.380> view<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:44.920> profile<00:01:45.700> pattern<00:01:46.120> and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
front view and a profile pattern and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.900 
front view and a profile pattern and
we're<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> use<00:01:47.200> those<00:01:47.350> again<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:48.370> start

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
we're going to use those again to start

00:01:48.910 --> 00:02:02.640 
we're going to use those again to start
working<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.680> plasticine<00:01:50.680> clay

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.060 

now<00:02:03.220> we<00:02:03.340> have<00:02:03.670> one<00:02:04.510> of<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.410> many<00:02:05.590> pieces<00:02:05.830> that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
now we have one of the many pieces that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.270 
now we have one of the many pieces that
will<00:02:06.310> go<00:02:06.430> back<00:02:06.610> together<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.830> turn<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.040> back

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
will go back together and turn this back

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.030 
will go back together and turn this back
into<00:02:09.310> our<00:02:10.119> puppet<00:02:10.570> head<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.290> as<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.770> can<00:02:11.860> see

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
into our puppet head so as you can see

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.570 
into our puppet head so as you can see
I've<00:02:12.160> got<00:02:12.310> most<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.790> together<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:13.390> and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I've got most of this together now and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.040 
I've got most of this together now and
once<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.790> start<00:02:16.150> getting<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.510> few<00:02:16.660> pieces

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
once you start getting a few pieces

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.110 
once you start getting a few pieces
together<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.560> starts<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:18.310> back<00:02:18.490> into<00:02:18.730> shape

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
together it starts going back into shape

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.690 
together it starts going back into shape
and<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.680> see<00:02:20.950> where<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.490> little

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and you can see where all the little

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.670 
and you can see where all the little
tick<00:02:21.910> marks<00:02:22.210> that<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.420> made<00:02:22.660> will<00:02:23.410> line<00:02:23.650> up

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
tick marks that we made will line up

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.060 
tick marks that we made will line up
with<00:02:23.890> each<00:02:24.160> other<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.870> help<00:02:26.020> fit<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.920> whole

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
with each other to help fit the whole

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.340 
with each other to help fit the whole
thing<00:02:27.310> back<00:02:27.520> together<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:30.990> see<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
thing back together and see that the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.780 
thing back together and see that the
shape<00:02:32.800> really<00:02:33.220> kind<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.760> does<00:02:35.070> come<00:02:36.070> back<00:02:36.310> into

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
shape really kind of does come back into

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.910 
shape really kind of does come back into
a<00:02:37.120> really<00:02:37.390> close<00:02:37.720> approximation<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.650> what<00:02:38.800> we

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
a really close approximation of what we

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.790 
a really close approximation of what we
had<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.250> our<00:02:39.370> clay<00:02:39.550> sculpture<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:41.440> is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
had in our clay sculpture and that is

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.660 
had in our clay sculpture and that is
again<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.720> same<00:02:43.930> character<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:45.160> we've<00:02:45.340> had

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
again the same character that we've had

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:56.630 
again the same character that we've had
in<00:02:45.850> our<00:02:45.970> initial<00:02:46.390> sketch

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.700
