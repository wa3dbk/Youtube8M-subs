nuances that go into the liq to make it

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.500 
nuances that go into the liq to make it
sound<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.819> liq<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.209> you're<00:03:06.360> not

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
sound just like the liq so you're not
