run to the washing machine and join a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.649 
run to the washing machine and join a
hold<00:01:41.040> X<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> do

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
hold X then what this is going to do

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
hold X then what this is going to do
it's<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> spawn<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> load<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.009> zombies

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
it's going to spawn a load of zombies
and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.880> 20<00:01:45.360> zombies<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and I think it's 20 zombies and then you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.990 
and I think it's 20 zombies and then you
just<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> wait<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.579> room<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.909> about

just want to wait in the room for about

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.569 
just want to wait in the room for about
30<00:01:48.390> seconds<00:01:48.960> until<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.399> get

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
out because there's going to be these

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170
