00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
two together this is going to create

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.980 
two together this is going to create
some<00:02:04.720> problem<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:07.360> going<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.630> pin<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.960> down

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
some problem I'm going to pin it down

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.270 
some problem I'm going to pin it down
and<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:11.020> going<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.440> stitch<00:02:11.860> only<00:02:12.550> part<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.300> it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and I'm going to stitch only part of it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.170 
and I'm going to stitch only part of it
probably<00:02:15.660> around<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:17.770> section<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.640> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
probably around this section here and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.660 
probably around this section here and
stop<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> rest<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.980> I'm<00:02:24.220> going

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
stop and then the rest of it I'm going

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.210 
stop and then the rest of it I'm going
to<00:02:24.820> hand<00:02:25.150> stitch<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.709> because<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.010> what's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
to hand stitch it because this is what's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.130 
to hand stitch it because this is what's
going<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.459> be<00:02:27.520> difficult<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.660> I'm<00:02:28.780> only<00:02:28.959> going

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
going to be difficult so I'm only going

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.080 
going to be difficult so I'm only going
to<00:02:29.200> do<00:02:29.320> that<00:02:29.350> section<00:02:30.250> because<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.850> don't

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
to do that section because I don't

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.140 
to do that section because I don't
really<00:02:31.270> want<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.540> hand<00:02:31.750> stitch<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.170> whole<00:02:32.350> lot

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
really want to hand stitch the whole lot

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.360 
really want to hand stitch the whole lot
there<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.900> normally<00:02:35.440> happens<00:02:35.470> here<00:02:36.160> is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
there but what normally happens here is

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.880 
there but what normally happens here is
really<00:02:36.630> there's<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.750> lot<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.080> puckering<00:02:38.530> going

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
really there's a lot of puckering going

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.170 
really there's a lot of puckering going
to<00:02:38.980> carry<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.680> I'll<00:02:42.010> do<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.549> as<00:02:42.760> far<00:02:42.970> as<00:02:43.090> I

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
to carry on so I'll do it as far as I

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.140 
to carry on so I'll do it as far as I
can<00:02:43.510> bag<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.200> out<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:46.570> then<00:02:47.489> hand<00:02:48.489> Stitch<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.850 
can bag it out and then hand Stitch the
rest<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.720> least<00:02:53.049> that's<00:02:53.230> half<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.470> job

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
rest so that least that's half the job

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
see the wadding the interlining I've cut

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.759 
see the wadding the interlining I've cut
it<00:03:20.530> down<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:22.000> cut<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.840> fabric<00:03:23.290> down<00:03:23.440> a

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
it down I can cut the this fabric down a

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.710 
it down I can cut the this fabric down a
bit<00:03:24.220> further<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.790> might<00:03:25.000> try<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.360> overlook

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
bit further but I might try and overlook

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.960 
bit further but I might try and overlook
it<00:03:25.870> first<00:03:26.140> or<00:03:26.410> I'm<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.220> snip<00:03:27.580> all<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970

it first or I'm going to snip all the
way<00:03:28.090> around<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.510> edges<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.980> what<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.580> actually

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
way around the edges so what I actually

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.050 
way around the edges so what I actually
did<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:31.600> sew<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.470> machine<00:03:33.250> from<00:03:33.610> there

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
did is I sew on the machine from there

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.809 
did is I sew on the machine from there
so<00:03:34.630> there<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.830> was<00:03:35.950> no<00:03:36.099> puckering<00:03:36.580> so<00:03:36.790> I

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
so there and it was no puckering so I

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.540 
so there and it was no puckering so I
continued<00:03:37.599> but<00:03:38.140> I've<00:03:38.260> left<00:03:38.530> an<00:03:38.739> opening<00:03:39.310> from

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
continued but I've left an opening from

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.760

here<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.910> here<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.900> can<00:03:41.050> bag<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.560> out

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
here to here so that I can bag it out

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.890 
here to here so that I can bag it out
and<00:03:42.040> that's<00:03:42.610> all<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:43.060> I've<00:03:43.180> got<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.510> sew<00:03:43.690> by

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.360 
and that's all that I've got to sew by
hand<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.319> that's<00:03:44.500> fantastic

hand so that's fantastic
