other thing to note is that you want to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
other thing to note is that you want to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
make sure that this is open so that your

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
make sure that this is open so that your
juice<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.119> come<00:01:09.150> straight<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> it

so<00:01:10.439> I'm<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.650> gonna<00:01:10.770> flip<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> we're

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
so I'm just gonna flip that then we're

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:27.030 
so I'm just gonna flip that then we're
ready<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> make<00:01:13.080> juice

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040

greens<00:01:30.080> like<00:01:30.380> kale<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:31.070> things<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.370> are

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
greens like kale and things that are

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.250 
greens like kale and things that are
really<00:01:31.610> fibrous<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.390> always<00:01:32.780> start<00:01:33.110> with<00:01:33.200> a

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
really fibrous I always start with a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.560 
really fibrous I always start with a
little<00:01:33.320> bit<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.650> apple<00:01:34.070> put<00:01:34.640> my<00:01:34.790> greens<00:01:35.090> in<00:01:35.330> and

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
little bit of apple put my greens in and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.360 
little bit of apple put my greens in and
then<00:01:35.750> chase<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:36.230> more<00:01:36.530> apple<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:37.130> just

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
then chase it with more apple I just

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.440 
then chase it with more apple I just
think<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.580> get<00:01:37.730> more<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.030> your<00:01:38.120> greens

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
think you get more out of your greens

00:01:38.450 --> 00:02:02.060 
think you get more out of your greens
that<00:01:38.660> way<00:01:39.040> let's<00:01:40.040> give<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.280> try
