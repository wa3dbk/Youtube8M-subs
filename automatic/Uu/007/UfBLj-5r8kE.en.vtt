00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
the new mission fish prototype now this

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.939 
the new mission fish prototype now this
is<00:00:56.000> just<00:00:56.269> a<00:00:56.390> sneak<00:00:56.629> peek<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:57.199> haven't<00:00:57.800> had

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
is just a sneak peek I haven't had

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.110 
is just a sneak peek I haven't had
enough<00:00:58.159> time<00:00:58.519> to<00:01:00.250> look<00:01:01.250> at<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.489> bait<00:01:01.699> or<00:01:01.879> fish

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
enough time to look at the bait or fish

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.270 
enough time to look at the bait or fish
the<00:01:02.300> bait<00:01:02.449> very<00:01:02.690> much<00:01:02.870> myself<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:03.739> here<00:01:04.070> goes

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the bait very much myself but here goes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.029 
the bait very much myself but here goes
the<00:01:04.729> new<00:01:04.850> version<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.390> fatter<00:01:06.229> its<00:01:07.159> rounder

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
the new version is fatter its rounder

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.300 
the new version is fatter its rounder
its<00:01:10.039> bulkier<00:01:10.729> it's<00:01:11.479> got<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.750> thicker<00:01:12.200> head<00:01:12.649> and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
its bulkier it's got a thicker head and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.930 
its bulkier it's got a thicker head and
neck<00:01:14.350> it's<00:01:15.350> got<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> truer<00:01:15.979> top<00:01:16.369> it's<00:01:16.759> got<00:01:16.880> a

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
neck it's got a truer top it's got a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.910 
neck it's got a truer top it's got a
concave<00:01:17.479> design<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:18.170> made<00:01:18.440> more<00:01:18.710> for

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
concave design it's made more for

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.399 
concave design it's made more for
swimming<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.610> then<00:01:19.670> for<00:01:19.909> Texas<00:01:20.270> rigging<00:01:20.630> but

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
swimming and then for Texas rigging but

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.020 
swimming and then for Texas rigging but
like<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> original<00:01:22.070> mission<00:01:22.220> fish<00:01:22.549> it<00:01:22.789> does

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
like the original mission fish it does

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.600 
like the original mission fish it does
both<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.990> bigger<00:01:24.440> rounder<00:01:25.310> fatter

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
both it's just a bigger rounder fatter

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.950 
both it's just a bigger rounder fatter
version<00:01:26.590> it's<00:01:27.590> got<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.009> Rising<00:01:28.429> Sun<00:01:28.640> tail<00:01:29.000> so

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
version it's got the Rising Sun tail so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.350 
version it's got the Rising Sun tail so
it's<00:01:30.110> got<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.259> slower<00:01:30.830> more<00:01:31.130> deliberate<00:01:31.640> swim

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
it's got a slower more deliberate swim

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.840 
it's got a slower more deliberate swim
more<00:01:32.720> thump<00:01:33.080> more<00:01:33.350> vibration<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.729> also

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
more thump more vibration it also

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.600 
more thump more vibration it also
changes<00:01:35.330> how<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.539> bait<00:01:35.750> Falls<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:37.460> new

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
changes how the bait Falls the new

changes how the bait Falls the new
mission<00:01:37.940> fish<00:01:38.149> has<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> reinforced<00:01:39.259> weedless

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
mission fish has a reinforced weedless

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.580 
mission fish has a reinforced weedless
split<00:01:40.940> belly<00:01:41.179> there's<00:01:41.659> actually<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.049> step<00:01:42.380> up

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
split belly there's actually a step up

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.199 
split belly there's actually a step up
with<00:01:42.740> additional<00:01:43.280> plastic<00:01:43.459> where<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.940> pin

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
with additional plastic where you pin

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.930 
with additional plastic where you pin
your<00:01:44.470> hooks<00:01:45.470> through<00:01:45.709> making<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.549> bait<00:01:46.700> more

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
your hooks through making the bait more

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.639 
your hooks through making the bait more
weedless<00:01:47.360> more<00:01:47.569> durable<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.350> believe

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
weedless more durable and I believe

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.340 
weedless more durable and I believe
coupled<00:01:49.039> with<00:01:49.479> braided<00:01:50.479> line<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.170> right

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
coupled with braided line and the right

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.210 
coupled with braided line and the right
hook<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.009> ADOT<00:01:52.459> owner<00:01:52.850> beast<00:01:53.299> hook<00:01:53.509> with<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
hook the ADOT owner beast hook with the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.729

centering<00:01:55.220> pin<00:01:55.550> spring<00:01:55.879> removed<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:57.319> better

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
centering pin spring removed is a better

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.359 
centering pin spring removed is a better
hooking<00:01:58.520> bait

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
hooking bait

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.749 
hooking bait
there's<00:02:01.359> a<00:02:01.450> lot<00:02:01.689> about<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.109> new<00:02:02.759> prototype

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
there's a lot about the new prototype

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.419 
there's a lot about the new prototype
that<00:02:04.119> looks<00:02:04.359> familiar<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:05.560> side<00:02:05.890> profile

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
that looks familiar the side profile

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.719 
that looks familiar the side profile
very<00:02:06.909> similar<00:02:07.769> the<00:02:08.769> original<00:02:09.280> versus<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
very similar the original versus the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.660 
very similar the original versus the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
prototype from the side laying down but

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.660 
prototype from the side laying down but
when<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.879> look<00:02:13.230> from<00:02:14.230> down<00:02:14.440> below<00:02:14.650> looking<00:02:15.430> up

when you look from down below looking up

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.940 
when you look from down below looking up
at<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> bait<00:02:16.090> you'll<00:02:16.660> notice<00:02:17.019> how<00:02:17.410> difference

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
at the bait you'll notice how difference

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.460 
at the bait you'll notice how difference
the<00:02:18.160> thicknesses<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.959> tail<00:02:20.230> and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
the thicknesses in the tail and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.059 
the thicknesses in the tail and
midsection<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.970> old<00:02:22.150> versus<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.599> new

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
of course the side-by-side just profound

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.380 
of course the side-by-side just profound
difference<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.799> flat<00:02:27.129> bait<00:02:27.430> versus<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> more

fat and round bait

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.680 
fat and round bait
I<00:02:29.920> believe<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.879> new<00:02:31.060> version<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.660> a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I believe this new version to be a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.229 
I believe this new version to be a
better<00:02:32.200> swimming<00:02:33.160> version<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> mission

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
better swimming version of the mission

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.630 
better swimming version of the mission
fish<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:35.260> new<00:02:35.410> version<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.220> bulkier

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
fish the new version is just a bulkier
