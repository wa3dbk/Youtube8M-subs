00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 and hello to all these ex- grass 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.040
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.210
 first video on gamekult that makes me 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.400
 extremely pleasure to be able to 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 speak from this site also famous and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 of such magnitude and I take this opportunity 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.410
 to start this video by thanking 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.030
 the editorial team that contacted me 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.800
 a few days ago to ask me if 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.449
 I was ok to participate with them on 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.920
 some videos around dark souls 2 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.050
 who is coming out on March 14 enough on 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 console and we finally have the date on pc that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 will be April 25 after we have changed 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.240
 with the editor by mail and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.590
 by phone I accepted and we went 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.420
 granted on half a dozen videos 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 that I will offer you all along 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.469
 of March for the stated purpose 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.640
 to try to propose to you in a way 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.620
 more progressive and the most educational 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.420
 possible all information 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 necessary to address darsouze the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.960
 the most serene way that is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.059
 a demanding game with a reputation for 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 difficulty a little overestimated but who 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.149
 is still there the difficulty exists 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 but what is really difficult to my 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.120
 meaning when we are new to a game 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.410
 like that is to assimilate a mass 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 information that exceeds us 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.660
 completely and who is not 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.579
 necessarily given by the game since the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.140
 game just like to hold a max 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 info and we must go by 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.379
 self and my goal month since a few 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.820
 years on the internet is to say to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 people that they can be discouraged by 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 this mass of assimilated information 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.049
 do not be i'll try to you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.610
 explain it to you get up garry's and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.810
 you will see this game behind everything 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 the world can do it and everyone 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.020
 can do it and so the purpose of this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.180
 video is to talk to you a little bit 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.520
 of all that and introduce you to you 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.509
 to the readers of gamekult the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.189
 what I do on the internet since 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.600
 soon four years so I started 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.189
 at the time to film with my phone 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 damon balances which is a game that has me 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.670
 marked deeply in my life of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.960
 player and that I recommend to everyone because 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.950
 that it's really a game that marks everything 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.659
 like dark souls it's games that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 in my opinion will mark the history of the game 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.570
 video of their imprint and that's why 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.860
 that I continue to talk about it again 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.720
 today imagine that's a thing 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.570
 like 150 200 videos that I have to do 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890
 on these two games together and I continue 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.119
 to play it is you ask people 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 that around you who play these games 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 there and who talks about it quite often 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.159
 we tend after playing these 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.020
 games there to have trouble playing to other 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.340
 thing precisely thanks to this feeling 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.759
 of accomplishment that one feels enough 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 dense and June and so by dint of talking 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.680
 from that game I acquired some 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 notoriety to the community 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.649
 Francophone I was invited including 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.969
 by the nose this blog that made me 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.290
 participated with him in three broadcasts 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.630
 spil games to present different 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.040
 speedrun of dark souls I had the honor 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 also to participate in the rheu stream 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.550
 french summer games gives quid so 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.200
 charity marathon in 2013 where I had 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.069
 could comment live a speedrun of dark 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.450
 souls 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.709
 and in addition to that necessarily when we 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.069
 begins to have more and more 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.680
 subscribers 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.150
 publishers see you as a source 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.069
 free advertising and so I was 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.260
 contacted by bandai namco in july 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.959
 2013 to come test in their premises 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.040
 in lyon the game dark souls 2 which had been 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.780
 announced a few months ago 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.209
 it follows to that inevitably there have been some 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 suspicions against me for corruption this 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.000
 that I totally understand and the purpose 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.889
 of this video it's just in a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.659
 concern for transparency to tell you that 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.340
 not to dispel a little bit of his doubts 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.599
 we talked about it with the editor 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.439
 we are we are rather on the same 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.639
 wavelength in terms of 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.829
 transparency at this level there is a 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.780
 requirement that I give myself me on my 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.159
 youtube channel for a few years and 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.139
 so it's just to tell you I 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.519
 am absolutely not employed by namco 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.780
 bandaÃ¯ to tell you about dark souls if 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.489
 I continue after all these years 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.840
 down payment to talk again about demon's souls 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.099
 dark souls it's because I like it 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.120
 I do not know what I find these games 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.530
 exciting I find these games 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.790
 extremely rich and above all I'm going 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.290
 to go further I will even tell you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.359
 that these games there I consider they do 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.919
 good at the video game as a whole 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.060
 I really want games like 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.620
 the game are known to the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.299
 maximum number of people are played by the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.189
 maximum so that suddenly others 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.389
 developers was saying that it works on 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.199
 will try to pick up this recipe there 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.430
 we will try to understand what has 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.049
 market in these games there and the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.479
 propose to the players because if you 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.829
 want in my ideal world of video gaming 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:23.159
 the neophyte player who will discover the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.569
 prism of the video game by the triple speaking 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.709
 annual that we are released and who are 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.340
 more and more tasteless and who you 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.049
 hold hands 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.790
 what will he do next and the goal 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.650
 I'm coming with my videos 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.819
 saying we're going to watch I'm going to try 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.379
 to explain things to you 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.030
 can understand the game by yourself 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.319
 and after finishing the game by yourself and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.239
 you will see that everyone can 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.290
 to arrive and that's really what 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.669
 has been at heart for years and it's 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.139
 for that I keep talking about everything 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.790
 it's a volunteer way I even take care of 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.229
 of the Facebook channel of the page 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.949
 facebook forgiveness of dark souls france 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.209
 for namco 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.519
 but I'm doing this really because I have 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.319
 want to be at the heart of it all and 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.680
 to invest myself in the community I am 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.750
 also 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.859
 I'm also part of a fortnight 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.719
 of people who take care of the wiki 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.459
 french february it's something that 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.719
 I'm generally concerned 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.129
 I'm passionate about it since 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.109
 now years and so it's for 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.250
 that I keep talking about it and that 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.959
 I was contacted today I think 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.669

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.569

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.350
 take into account to improve myself 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.150
 since I am an amateur videographer 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.650
