00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.289

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.259
 here this 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.119

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.390
 What's the name of someone who's lying? 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 the liar or the one that such other commandment 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 will not steal 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.080
 Did you steal anything at least once? 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.080
 never but you just said you're a liar 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.570
 well I walked some candy when I was a kid and how we played somebody 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.780
 that steals 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.610
 What are we going to try another? 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.570
 will not adulterate 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 and if it were I never betrayed my wife 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.810
 they 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.650
 there was a return 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.070
 good afternoon 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.110
 jesus said 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.760
 if you look at a woman with desire you have already committed adultery with 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.430
 her in your heart 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.229
 the world 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.320
 ah presentation 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.710
 we will not take the name of the Lord your God in vain 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 You already used the name of God to get there. 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 the middle 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.490
 so lord cool guy called blasphemy 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.759
 God gave you life, the breath, everything you have 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 This game is not determined Rome 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.270
 so by your own dismissal you're a thief liar but you have a pain 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.540
 and tampered with the heart, and that as much as in the ten commandments okey to the ocde 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.100
 so I'm not perfect 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.949
 actually much worse than that 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.840
 imagine how the light is and the center taken to record all his 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.129
 thoughts for a week why then show all your thoughts 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.069
 on a movie screen for all your friends and family ask for this serious 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.019
 shameful thought 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.019
 pm said he knows them all 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 even the secret thoughts in your heart d 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:34.859
 c compared to some people I am a saint they will be true but the boss 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.980
 and god's law not other people art 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.060
 Besides that 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.669
 even if you have home are five times a day in a year 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.229
 would be in 1825 sins 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.089
 if you live until the age of 70 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:56.379
 you will have broken the law of god 127 thousand times you will have to answer for 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.349
 every sin on the day of judgment 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.859
 the Bible says that each of us 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.859
 will give of account of God 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.939
 the zope will forgive certain 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.939
 Let's try this in court. I know that. 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:13.720
 More than that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.359
 you can not be 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.950
 Do you know if you wanted to identify? I'm a corrupt judge. Would you accept that? 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.169
 a good judge would say 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.619
 looks fictitious of guti by sports the first 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.739
 god is not a corrupt judge 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.969
 he is a judge and he just gets the sin 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.369
 rel 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.580
 Jesus warned that on the day of judgment 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.210
 all those who sinned against God near there a garrucha a leg would not be like 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.519
 to escape for all eternity 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.340
 So how can anyone get into heaven? 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.579
 I'm a path 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.569
 God loved the world so much. 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.730
 who sent his son jesus to live a perfect life 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.430
 he never sinned even once, so Jesus accepted to receive the punishment 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 for guilty sinners he was begotten past actions nailed in a nap 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.310
 and died for justice to be done and sinners were set free 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.049
 Then Jesus raised from the tomb of Raul 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.519
 with one death 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.039
 you can not deserve eternal life 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.050
 she is a gift from God to all who have disappeared and come jesus 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.309
 he will forgive you 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:31.649
 biti will purify haiti give to new heart with new desires the bible 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:34.649
 says that if someone is in Christ he is a new creature 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.970
 So stop living for you and turn your back on your sins. Come on. 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.389

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.309
