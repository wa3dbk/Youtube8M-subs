he's<00:01:28.590> clearly<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> advantage<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.850> I'm

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
he's clearly got the advantage so I'm

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420 
he's clearly got the advantage so I'm
not<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.110> however<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.189> game

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
not going out from however in this game

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
not going out from however in this game
I<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:33.000> modify<00:01:33.210> my<00:01:33.450> car<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.200> head<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.560> back

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I can modify my car and head right back

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.310 
I can modify my car and head right back
out<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.360> show<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> field<00:01:36.689> what's<00:01:37.049> up

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
out there and show the field what's up

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.300 
out there and show the field what's up
which<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.470> happy<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:40.950> cuz<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
which I do and I'm very happy by cuz it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.969 
which I do and I'm very happy by cuz it
was<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> those<00:01:41.909> things<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.299> needed<00:01:42.570> but

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
was one of those things I was needed but

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.780 
was one of those things I was needed but
because<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.040> increased<00:01:44.340> horsepower<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
because that increased horsepower and I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.889 
because that increased horsepower and I
got<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> fully<00:01:45.210> adjustable<00:01:45.630> suspension

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
got the fully adjustable suspension

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
got the fully adjustable suspension
setup<00:01:46.439> I'm<00:01:46.829> gonna<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.040> through<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> change

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
setup I'm gonna go through and change

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
setup I'm gonna go through and change
some<00:01:47.880> things<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> suspension<00:01:49.350> setup

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
some things now the suspension setup

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780 
some things now the suspension setup
what<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.910 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.299> stiffness<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> anti-roll

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
change the stiffness on the anti-roll

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
change the stiffness on the anti-roll
bars<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.670> come<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:53.970> three<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.049> in

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
bars they come at three but I just in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.230 
bars they come at three but I just in
the<00:01:55.259> five<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> five<00:01:57.030> now

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the five and then the back to five now

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.819 
the five and then the back to five now
you're<00:01:57.390> wondering<00:01:57.659> why<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.799> way

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you're wondering why not go all the way

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.560 
you're wondering why not go all the way
to<00:01:58.920> seven<00:01:59.250> because<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.299> you're<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
to seven because if you're going to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.899 
to seven because if you're going to
stiffed<00:02:01.049> them<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.320> all<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.530> way<00:02:01.649> um<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
stiffed them up all the way um it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.340 
stiffed them up all the way um it
doesn't<00:02:03.119> give<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.420> much<00:02:03.540> play<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.049> want<00:02:04.290> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
doesn't give as much play so I want to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.630 
doesn't give as much play so I want to
be<00:02:04.409> able<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.590> feel<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.829> slide<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.520> then

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
be able to feel that slide and then

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
be able to feel that slide and then
you'll<00:02:05.759> see<00:02:05.939> me<00:02:06.090> adjust<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.659> top<00:02:06.990> speed<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you'll see me adjust the top speed to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.309 
you'll see me adjust the top speed to
180<00:02:07.649> miles<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.039> hour<00:02:08.690> just<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:09.989> bit<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
180 miles an hour just a little bit I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
180 miles an hour just a little bit I
personally<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.220> watching<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.610> video

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
personally as I was watching the video

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.800 
personally as I was watching the video
again<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.629> should

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
again I was like you know I should

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.760 
again I was like you know I should
probably<00:02:12.840> put

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
probably put

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950 
probably put
up<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.100> 186<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.150> think<00:02:15.330> was<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.450> next<00:02:15.660> step

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
up to like 186 I think was the next step

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.530 
up to like 186 I think was the next step
up<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> didn't<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.880> eventually<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.360> move

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
up but I didn't I know eventually I move

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.410 
up but I didn't I know eventually I move
it<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.840> close<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> 190<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.240> maybe

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
it up to close to 190 I think so maybe

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
it up to close to 190 I think so maybe
like<00:02:21.630> winning<00:02:21.960> 6-2<00:02:22.380> 192<00:02:23.220> or<00:02:23.370> whatever<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
like winning 6-2 192 or whatever the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.110 
like winning 6-2 192 or whatever the
next<00:02:23.760> thing<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.720> next<00:02:25.350> ladder<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.970> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
next thing up next ladder up but so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.790 
next thing up next ladder up but so
we're<00:02:27.270> off<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:27.990> off<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.080> running<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
we're off we're off and running and you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.540 
we're off we're off and running and you
can<00:02:28.950> take<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> look<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.460> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
can take a look at it like a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.400 
can take a look at it like a
front-wheel-drive<00:02:30.090> cars<00:02:30.660> had<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> serious

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
front-wheel-drive cars had a serious

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.570 
front-wheel-drive cars had a serious
disadvantage<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> all-wheel<00:02:32.400> drive

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
disadvantage to the all-wheel drive

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.510 
disadvantage to the all-wheel drive
super<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.060> took<00:02:33.240> off<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.660> real<00:02:33.840> drive<00:02:34.140> cars

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
super that took off the real drive cars

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.800 
super that took off the real drive cars
but<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.730> mean<00:02:35.880> I've<00:02:36.000> got<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> horsepower<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
but I mean I've got the horsepower to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.970 
but I mean I've got the horsepower to
keep<00:02:36.960> up<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.230> them<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.800> weight<00:02:37.950> i

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
keep up with them and the weight i

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.020 
keep up with them and the weight i
probably<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> lot<00:02:38.520> more<00:02:38.670> weight

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
probably have a lot more weight

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240 
probably have a lot more weight
horsepower<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.870> wait<00:02:39.990> wait<00:02:40.260> wow<00:02:40.590> I've<00:02:41.040> got<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
horsepower to wait wait wow I've got a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.160 
horsepower to wait wait wow I've got a
weight<00:02:41.490> advantage<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.090> probably<00:02:42.780> horsepower

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
weight advantage and probably horsepower

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.390 
weight advantage and probably horsepower
advantage<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.710> power<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.160> weight<00:02:44.340> ratio

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
advantage to the power to weight ratio

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.950 
advantage to the power to weight ratio
that<00:02:44.940> was<00:02:45.060> trying<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.330> say<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.660> minute<00:02:45.870> ago

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960

that was trying to say just a minute ago
is<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.710> my<00:02:46.830> favor<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.240> me

is in my favor and you can see me

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.420 
is in my favor and you can see me
catching<00:02:48.510> them<00:02:48.810> quite<00:02:49.320> easily<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:50.070> these<00:02:50.190> cars

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
catching them quite easily to these cars

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.950 
catching them quite easily to these cars
and<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:51.330> no<00:02:51.510> don't<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:51.930> it

I really would hate for it to be

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.710 
I really would hate for it to be
something<00:05:11.620> very<00:05:11.949> serious<00:05:12.340> or<00:05:12.789> more<00:05:13.240> serious

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
something very serious or more serious

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.620 
something very serious or more serious
than<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.110> a<00:05:14.259> change<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.710> diet<00:05:14.949> you<00:05:15.220> know<00:05:15.630> and
