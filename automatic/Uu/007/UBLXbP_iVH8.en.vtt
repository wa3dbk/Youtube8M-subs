00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.339
 modernism channel 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 tip number one in quite wrong view 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.060
 and why you will not want to have a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.570
 control one is little case quickly 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 in the world 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 This would be stupid. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 lose all that investment you 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 made the plane because of a failure one 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 pane in the jaw 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 so the tip is not every month on the radio 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 like the radio that you give 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.360
 I 'm tired of talking to the tribute. 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 I'm at the market, but I'll say it again. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 two with good engine in new with two 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.730
 socks is very boring because it has 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 more components 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.329
 if you buy a very bad engine 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.149
 quality does not end up having too much pain 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.489
 head to have his new album and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.199
 people did not get there many people 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.650
 who bought her gasoline models 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 Why can not you fly avoid masses? 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.040
 as it is in this way comes to r 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.430
 hiring them is very poorly done. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.119
 references to brands as it is to say and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.939
 mainly from tip number 3 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.240
 in the first must be respected you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.920
 You will not want to take any chances. 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 unnecessary for the cord in the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.960
 structure you may even roll but I 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.090
 I've had the good things and make sure 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 tip number 4 marries as such to cbat 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.570
 we use fast and strong the more 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.329
 fast and strong is better here because 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 I want to go well the faster the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.470
 brain more consumes you will have solar 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 model as a much better shape than 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.300
 at least so you 're not stressing 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 it remains undefined 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.760

 4.8 everyone pulls and you only buy 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.830
 check the speed and speed of the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 force while the forces well take more 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.620
