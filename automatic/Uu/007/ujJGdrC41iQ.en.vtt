00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.750 

now<00:03:31.990> I<00:03:32.350> don't<00:03:32.680> like<00:03:32.920> using<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.310> lot<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.610> bleach

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
now I don't like using a lot of bleach

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.250 
now I don't like using a lot of bleach
because<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.300> not<00:03:34.390> great<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:35.200> the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
because it's just not great for the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.730 
because it's just not great for the
fibers<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.660> get<00:03:37.900> rid<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.140> most<00:03:38.530> of

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
clarifying shampoo actually find out the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.680 
clarifying shampoo actually find out the
varnish<00:03:44.530> works<00:03:44.800> better<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.450> end<00:03:46.600> up

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
varnish works better then you end up

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.630 
varnish works better then you end up
using<00:03:46.900> less<00:03:48.210> leach<00:03:49.210> and<00:03:49.600> your<00:03:50.530> shirts<00:03:50.800> get

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
using less leach and your shirts get

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.970 
using less leach and your shirts get
cleaner<00:03:52.030> then<00:03:52.900> if<00:03:53.020> you<00:03:53.170> just<00:03:53.290> put<00:03:53.530> finish<00:03:53.830> in
