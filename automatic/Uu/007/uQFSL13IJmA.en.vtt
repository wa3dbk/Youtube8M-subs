you can realize that no matter how good

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.110 
you can realize that no matter how good
you<00:06:35.400> are<00:06:35.490> you're<00:06:35.610> always<00:06:35.669> trying<00:06:36.000> to<00:06:36.089> find

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
you are you're always trying to find

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.719 
you are you're always trying to find
ways<00:06:36.330> to<00:06:36.539> get<00:06:36.629> faster<00:06:37.080> and<00:06:37.199> in<00:06:38.039> that<00:06:38.370> race<00:06:38.550> you

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
ways to get faster and in that race you

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.329 
ways to get faster and in that race you
know<00:06:38.849> is<00:06:39.000> just<00:06:39.029> kind<00:06:39.330> of<00:06:39.360> a<00:06:39.449> rhythm<00:06:39.750> thing<00:06:39.960> and

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:40.339 
know is just kind of a rhythm thing and

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.469 
know is just kind of a rhythm thing and
didn't<00:06:41.339> feel<00:06:41.460> like<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:41.669> got<00:06:41.789> into<00:06:42.000> my<00:06:42.089> rhythm<00:06:42.240> to

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
didn't feel like I got into my rhythm to

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.170 
didn't feel like I got into my rhythm to
probably<00:06:42.690> 75<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:43.589> then<00:06:43.729> kind<00:06:44.729> of<00:06:44.819> fell<00:06:45.000> off<00:06:45.029> a

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
probably 75 and then kind of fell off a

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.839 
probably 75 and then kind of fell off a
little<00:06:45.389> bit<00:06:45.539> but<00:06:46.009> if<00:06:47.009> you<00:06:47.190> if<00:06:47.400> you<00:06:47.490> don't<00:06:47.669> focus

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
little bit but if you if you don't focus

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.100 
little bit but if you if you don't focus
on<00:06:48.060> what<00:06:48.210> you're<00:06:48.270> trying<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.539> focus<00:06:48.659> on<00:06:48.930> and

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
on what you're trying to focus on and

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.860 
on what you're trying to focus on and
get<00:06:49.229> better<00:06:49.379> then<00:06:49.919> that<00:06:50.460> raises<00:06:51.180> a<00:06:51.389> waste<00:06:51.659> but

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870
