00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello youtube friends today we are going to do 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:12.620
 a painting using colored sheets that 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.080
 they decorate and it looks very beautiful and this very 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.110
 simple very easy to make 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.250
 good the materials that we're going we're going to 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.250
 need are approximately 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:33.160
 then about 20 colored sheets of about 16 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.680
 colored sheets of which is your 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.150
 preference the one you like the most 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:46.540
 We are going to need scissors 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:49.180
 and glue what is it like with 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.480
 I'm going to hit it, it seems just that 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.480
 they can be on the shell or in a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.810
 cardboard or as desired 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.300
 good 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.330
 The first thing we are going to do is that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.970
 we have our sheet we are going to close one 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.550
 corner 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.550
 and let's leave it like that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 like double 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.710
 if this small rectangle that we have left 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.710
 we are going to cut it 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.790
 and not just this, now let's go 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.790
 fold half 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.060
 do not look too good, mark a small 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.290
 fold me in the middle of the sheet nothing more 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.760
 in the middle stomach 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.760
 and then to the other half 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.270
 well and we double-check like 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.630
 we realize that we stayed as 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.690
 a kind of cross 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.770
 now all corners are going to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.770
 take to that cross 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 and the same ends all 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.040
 why 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.430
 look 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 if we are going to keep this after what 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.890
 has he did the procedure with 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.090
 our 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.269
 leaves 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.980
 we will occupy occupying 16 sheets 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.380
 after not only the size that you 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 like 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.790
 and at the end we have all the leaves 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.579
 you think 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.579
 and as a final result we will give this 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.670
 so remember that the leaves separate them 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.379
 they gave them a little bit like that for 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.609
 to be noticed like that and I do not know I did not have to 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.950
 bullshit or very like that a little bit and now 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.530
 as they are an effect 13 I recommend that 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.500
 your eyes are grouped by colors of the most 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.579
 dark to the clearest and so will 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.579
 highlight a little more 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.230
 A) Yes 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.019
 and with the glue they are going to stick 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.970
 in its shell on its cardboard or in the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.260
 I hit him directly on the wall 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.319
 good wall that's all for today what 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.069
 we wait tomorrow 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.360
 with an author so they can decorate 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.020
 and do it yourself 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.020
 goodbye
