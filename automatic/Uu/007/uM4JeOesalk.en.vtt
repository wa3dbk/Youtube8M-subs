out and it looks pretty good right there

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.080 
out and it looks pretty good right there
but<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.500> still<00:01:44.920> need<00:01:45.070> some<00:01:45.340> things<00:01:45.580> done<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.940> it

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.570 
but it still need some things done to it
starters<00:01:47.050> we're<00:01:47.229> going<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.409> go<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.530> layer<00:01:48.369> that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
blending options and then we're going to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.359 
blending options and then we're going to
change<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.810> to<00:02:00.690> multiply<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.979> set<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
change it to multiply and then set the

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.400 
change it to multiply and then set the
opacity<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:04.360> seventy<00:02:05.080> percent<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.869> if

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
opacity to seventy percent and then if

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.979 
opacity to seventy percent and then if
that<00:02:08.649> looks<00:02:08.830> good<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.910> one<00:02:10.360> last<00:02:10.509> thing<00:02:10.690> we're

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
that looks good and one last thing we're

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.550 
that looks good and one last thing we're
going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> filter<00:02:11.500> blur<00:02:12.570> Gaussian<00:02:13.570> blur<00:02:13.600> so

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
going to filter blur Gaussian blur so

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.809 
going to filter blur Gaussian blur so
don't<00:02:14.739> want<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:15.040> too<00:02:15.220> much<00:02:15.250> we're<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.730> to

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
don't want to be too much we're going to

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.059 
don't want to be too much we're going to
set<00:02:15.940> at<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> point<00:02:16.300> 2<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.410> preview<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
set at the point 2 and the preview you

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.920 
set at the point 2 and the preview you
can<00:02:18.100> see<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.580> there<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.940> difference<00:02:19.390> it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
can see that there is a difference it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.509 
can see that there is a difference it's
not<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> big<00:02:20.470> difference<00:02:20.860> but<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:21.190> enough<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
not a big difference but it's enough to

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.210 
not a big difference but it's enough to
