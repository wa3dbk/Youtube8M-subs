we<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.180> make<00:00:27.359> lists<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.820> first

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we are going to make lists and the first

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.640 
we are going to make lists and the first
thing<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.359> want<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> let<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.929> guys<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.230> is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
thing I want to let you guys know is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.229 
thing I want to let you guys know is
that<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.130> actually<00:00:32.219> two<00:00:32.460> different

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that there are actually two different

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.040 
that there are actually two different
types<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.780> lists<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.460> HTML<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:36.050> unordered

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
types of lists in HTML you get unordered

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.580 
types of lists in HTML you get unordered
lists<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.430> ordered<00:00:39.180> lists<00:00:39.629> now

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
lists and then you get ordered lists now

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.270 
lists and then you get ordered lists now
unordered<00:00:41.460> lists<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.000> basically<00:00:43.070> lists<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
unordered lists are basically lists that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.020 
unordered lists are basically lists that
have<00:00:44.309> bullet<00:00:45.000> points<00:00:45.030> next<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> each<00:00:45.930> item<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
have bullet points next to each item and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.290 
have bullet points next to each item and
like<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.719> write<00:00:48.930> them<00:00:49.520> each<00:00:50.520> item<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> any

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
like you can write them each item in any

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
like you can write them each item in any
order<00:00:51.719> that'll<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.320> doesn't<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.149> be<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
order that'll it doesn't have to be a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
order that'll it doesn't have to be a
specific<00:00:54.480> order<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.230> each<00:00:55.500> item<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
specific order to each item that you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.900 
specific order to each item that you
that<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.410> want<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> list<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.879> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
that you want in the list and then you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
that you want in the list and then you
have<00:01:00.270> ordered<00:01:00.750> lists<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
have ordered lists which have the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.679 
have ordered lists which have the
numbers<00:01:02.340> next<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.500> then<00:01:04.500> obviously

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
numbers next to them and then obviously

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
numbers next to them and then obviously
those<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:06.720> items<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.460> order

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
those are items that have to be in order

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
those are items that have to be in order
like<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.659> were<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> give<00:01:10.110> someone

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
like if you were going to give someone

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
like if you were going to give someone
steps<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.220> doing<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.610> why<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:14.790> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
steps to doing something so why don't we

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
steps to doing something so why don't we
go<00:01:15.000> ahead<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.479> staff<00:01:15.750> straight<00:01:16.170> into

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
go ahead and your staff straight into

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.600 
go ahead and your staff straight into
this<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> make<00:01:17.280> an<00:01:17.520> unordered<00:01:18.150> list<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.610> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
this and make an unordered list so to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.690 
this and make an unordered list so to
make<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.909> unordered<00:01:21.330> list<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.350> tag<00:01:22.700> ul

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
make an unordered list we use the tag ul

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.359 
make an unordered list we use the tag ul
and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.259> end<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:26.750> /ul<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.250> there<00:01:29.250> we

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and then to end it off /ul and there we

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
and then to end it off /ul and there we
go<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.729> we've<00:01:29.939> told<00:01:30.210> HTML<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
go now we've told HTML that we want to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.819 
go now we've told HTML that we want to
make<00:01:31.439> an<00:01:31.619> unordered<00:01:32.040> list<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:34.350> actually

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
make an unordered list but to actually

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
make an unordered list but to actually
give<00:01:34.979> our<00:01:35.130> list<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:35.610> content<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
give our list some content we need to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.469 
give our list some content we need to
add<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.920> list<00:01:38.400> item<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> basically

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
add in a list item so that is basically

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.920 
add in a list item so that is basically
smaller<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.659> greater<00:01:42.899> than<00:01:42.960> sign<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.610> then

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
smaller than greater than sign and then

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.100 
smaller than greater than sign and then
Li<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.799> list<00:01:47.009> item<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:48.360> obviously<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
Li for list item and then obviously you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.260 
Li for list item and then obviously you
need<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.439> end<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> /li

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
need to end this all for the /li

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.109 
need to end this all for the /li
and<00:01:51.770> there<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.860> go<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.430> start<00:01:53.670> adding

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and there we go now we can start adding

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.149 
and there we go now we can start adding
items<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.930> our<00:01:54.960> list<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.009> actually

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
items to our list so I'm just actually

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.060 
items to our list so I'm just actually
in<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> copy-paste<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.149> quickly<00:01:57.450> and<00:02:01.070> why

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
in a copy-paste this quickly and why

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.530 
in a copy-paste this quickly and why
don't<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.520> make<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> list<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.240> foods

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
don't we just make it a list of foods

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
don't we just make it a list of foods
that<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:03.930> eat<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.490> to

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
foods anyways so that's how we make an

unordered list let's just go ahead and
make<00:03:44.000> an<00:03:44.239> ordered<00:03:44.720> list<00:03:44.750> quickly<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.129> then<00:03:46.459> we

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
make an ordered list quickly and then we

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.869 
make an ordered list quickly and then we
can<00:03:46.910> tell<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.660> difference<00:03:48.019> between<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.560> two

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
can tell the difference between the two

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.059 
can tell the difference between the two

and now what we can do is add in our
first<00:04:48.110> step<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.710> our<00:04:49.220> first<00:04:49.610> step<00:04:49.850> to

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
first step and our first step to

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.970

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
is open your web browser and the second

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.750

and the next one is uh watch my HTML Oh

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.970 
and the next one is uh watch my HTML Oh
what<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.720> hell<00:05:24.290> how<00:05:24.650> did<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:26.590> okay<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:27.650> let's

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
what the hell how did I okay so let's

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.100 
what the hell how did I okay so let's
just<00:05:28.160> go<00:05:28.310> ahead<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:28.640> move<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:29.360> text<00:05:29.810> uh<00:05:29.930> put

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
just go ahead and move that text uh put

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.070 
just go ahead and move that text uh put
on<00:05:30.200> a<00:05:30.320> how<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.610> ended<00:05:31.610> up<00:05:31.730> getting<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.810> down

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
on a how I ended up getting that down

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.310 
on a how I ended up getting that down
onto<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.410> next<00:05:33.590> level<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:35.720> next<00:05:35.930> step<00:05:36.170> you

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
onto the next level so the next step you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.790 
onto the next level so the next step you
need<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.530> do<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:36.890> watch<00:05:37.490> my<00:05:37.880> HTML<00:05:39.160> series<00:05:40.160> and

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
need to do is watch my HTML series and

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.090 
need to do is watch my HTML series and
then<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:43.400> guess<00:05:43.790> the<00:05:43.970> last<00:05:44.090> step<00:05:44.480> would<00:05:44.630> be<00:05:44.690> to

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
then I guess the last step would be to

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.240 
then I guess the last step would be to
practice<00:05:46.100> and<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:48.380> more<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.620> practice<00:05:48.830> the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
practice and the more you practice the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.240 
practice and the more you practice the
better<00:05:49.370> you<00:05:49.550> get<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.600> better<00:05:50.630> you<00:05:50.930> get

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
better you get and the better you get

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.160 
better you get and the better you get
yeah<00:05:52.280> then<00:05:52.700> you<00:05:53.150> can<00:05:53.300> start<00:05:53.510> writing<00:05:53.990> your<00:05:54.110> own

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
yeah then you can start writing your own

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.990 
yeah then you can start writing your own
websites<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:54.920> going<00:05:55.190> to<00:05:55.310> publish<00:05:55.640> them<00:05:55.880> and

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
websites and going to publish them and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.070 
websites and going to publish them and
stuff<00:05:56.380> so<00:05:57.380> let's<00:05:58.040> run<00:05:58.250> this<00:05:58.460> info<00:05:58.790> in<00:05:59.080> Firefox
