00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
be able to see why this is by far the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.170 
be able to see why this is by far the
best<00:02:57.510> way<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.519> but<00:02:59.519> we're<00:02:59.849> going<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.000> run

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
best way to do it but we're going to run

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.509 
best way to do it but we're going to run
over<00:03:00.239> here<00:03:00.659> we're<00:03:01.349> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.530> go<00:03:01.650> ahead<00:03:01.769> grab

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
over here we're going to go ahead grab

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.759 
over here we're going to go ahead grab
this<00:03:02.849> we<00:03:03.450> could<00:03:04.049> have<00:03:04.200> gotten<00:03:04.379> that's<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
this we could have gotten that's a

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.960 
this we could have gotten that's a
couple<00:03:05.010> more<00:03:05.159> times<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.549> was<00:03:05.819> paying

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
couple more times if I was paying

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.369 
couple more times if I was paying
attention<00:03:06.540> or<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.780> couple<00:03:07.079> more<00:03:07.230> times

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
attention or a couple more times

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.380 
attention or a couple more times
probably<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.890> hit<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.190> one<00:03:08.370> more<00:03:08.519> time<00:03:08.760> we're

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
probably to hit it one more time we're

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.729 
probably to hit it one more time we're
going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.569> only<00:03:09.690> probably<00:03:09.989> get<00:03:10.109> about<00:03:10.200> three<00:03:10.560> I

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
going to only probably get about three I

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.400 
going to only probably get about three I
doubt<00:03:11.129> we're<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.670> fourth<00:03:12.030> time<00:03:12.410> you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
doubt we're gonna get it fourth time you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.140 
doubt we're gonna get it fourth time you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
can actually form this chest and that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.099 
can actually form this chest and that
spot<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:16.200> about<00:03:16.980> five<00:03:17.579> times<00:03:17.849> if<00:03:18.660> you're<00:03:18.989> able

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
spot for about five times if you're able

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.319 
spot for about five times if you're able
to<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.620> fast<00:03:19.799> enough<00:03:20.069> but<00:03:20.639> yeah<00:03:21.000> there's<00:03:21.209> no

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329

in your area that's cancelling the
spawns<00:05:48.570> you<00:05:48.840> are<00:05:48.960> good<00:05:49.200> to<00:05:49.229> keep

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
spawns you are good to keep

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.040 
spawns you are good to keep
doing<00:05:50.190> this<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.610> guys<00:05:51.330> all<00:05:51.510> you're<00:05:51.690> doing<00:05:51.900> is

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
doing this and guys all you're doing is

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.080 
doing this and guys all you're doing is
you're<00:05:52.080> just<00:05:52.260> farming<00:05:52.680> for<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:53.010> grams<00:05:53.280> this<00:05:53.940> is

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
you're just farming for in grams this is

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.060 
you're just farming for in grams this is
like<00:05:54.240> in<00:05:54.390> between<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.960> ether<00:05:55.200> chest<00:05:55.470> spawns

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
like in between the ether chest spawns

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.060 
like in between the ether chest spawns
so<00:05:56.820> this<00:05:57.000> is<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.330> best<00:05:57.600> way<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.050> get<00:05:58.380> in<00:05:58.650> grams

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
so this is the best way to get in grams

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.980 
so this is the best way to get in grams
Lou<00:05:59.370> caves<00:05:59.580> are<00:05:59.790> dead<00:06:00.180> but<00:06:00.450> if<00:06:00.540> you<00:06:00.630> do<00:06:00.720> Luke

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
Lou caves are dead but if you do Luke

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.400 
Lou caves are dead but if you do Luke
aid<00:06:01.200> and<00:06:01.470> an<00:06:02.160> ether<00:06:02.880> chest<00:06:03.150> farm<00:06:03.570> you're<00:06:04.020> able

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
aid and an ether chest farm you're able

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.530 
aid and an ether chest farm you're able
to<00:06:04.530> just<00:06:04.740> get<00:06:04.890> an<00:06:05.070> insane<00:06:05.550> amount<00:06:05.910> of<00:06:06.330> many

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
to just get an insane amount of many

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.270 
to just get an insane amount of many
grams<00:06:06.810> there's<00:06:07.170> a<00:06:07.260> green<00:06:07.560> there<00:06:07.830> there's

grams there's a green there there's
probably<00:06:08.520> a<00:06:08.730> couple<00:06:08.880> more<00:06:09.090> greens<00:06:09.390> over<00:06:09.690> there

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
probably a couple more greens over there

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.200 
probably a couple more greens over there
there<00:06:10.920> is<00:06:11.070> a<00:06:11.100> blue<00:06:11.430> over<00:06:11.640> there<00:06:11.700> that<00:06:11.910> we<00:06:12.000> saw
