for this place because the area's what's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.150 
for this place because the area's what's
important<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.190> IOM<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.620> hardware

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
important to IOM is not just a hardware

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.600 
important to IOM is not just a hardware
not<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.590> 8,000<00:03:02.590> cubic<00:03:02.770> meters<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.400> rock

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
not just the 8,000 cubic meters of rock

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.070 
not just the 8,000 cubic meters of rock
that<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.180> or<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.450> treasures

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
that you see or the treasures

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.020 
that you see or the treasures
it's<00:03:05.500> also<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.950> fact<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> many<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.970> these

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
it's also the fact that many of these

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.820 
it's also the fact that many of these
people<00:03:07.420> have<00:03:07.510> just<00:03:07.660> been<00:03:07.810> displaced<00:03:08.350> four

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
people have just been displaced four

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
people have just been displaced four
times<00:03:09.190> since<00:03:10.120> 1987<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.070> very<00:03:12.280> much<00:03:12.520> part

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
times since 1987 so it's very much part

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.320 
times since 1987 so it's very much part
of<00:03:13.120> our<00:03:13.239> sort<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.690> resettlement

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
of our sort of resettlement

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.280
