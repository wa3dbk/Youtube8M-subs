00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
he he's been kidnapped oh no is there a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.369 
he he's been kidnapped oh no is there a
ransom<00:00:13.099> yeah<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> dollar<00:00:14.910> fifty

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
ransom yeah but it's like a dollar fifty

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.750 
ransom yeah but it's like a dollar fifty
yeah<00:00:16.379> screw<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.980> let's<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> thing

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
yeah screw that let's get this thing

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:32.420 
yeah screw that let's get this thing
going<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.199> three<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.040> obvious<00:00:32.369> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
going one two three so it's obvious that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
made physics the core part of gameplay

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
made physics the core part of gameplay
as<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.560> made<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.009> player<00:01:38.250> solve<00:01:38.640> physics

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
