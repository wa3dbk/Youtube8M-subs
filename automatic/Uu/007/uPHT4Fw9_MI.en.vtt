 to it the one who so welcome to this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.029
 new tutorial in which I'm going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.960
 explain to teach how to uninstall a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.580
 program that is not left or can not be 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.920
 from the same control panel or panel 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.630
 of control since for example you can 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 be happening if you're watching 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 this video is this for example I want it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.840
 uninstall here and it does not leave me ok then 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 for this we are going to use a program 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 very good program and I do not know if they can 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.940
 know today you have heard that it is this and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.390
 they avoid installing is in version 4 and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.079
 good weighs 16 29 megabytes in regular 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.899
 almost nothing we give in free download 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.480
 it serves for windows 8 and windows 7 it 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 we give in download free 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.880
 ok, it will take us to another page 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.120
 we give in download now download no 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.250

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.440
 a moment yes 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.740
 and this has to download here is 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.530
 automatically ok I give to cancel in 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.720
 this case because I already have it already 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.670
 I had downloaded with anticipation 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.650
 Now what we are going to do is go to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.330
 place where we have saved it 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.070
 download in this case I have it here in 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.510
 the download section I'm going to 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.510
 drag to my desk 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 ok once we have here the 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.240
 installer we are going to give double click 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.609
 we give him that if there are no permits 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.649
 no problem and here we get all this 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.069
 we give you to cancel and accept what 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.409
 we mark and here we set it apart as it does not 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.760
 we want to install this program we give 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.430
 in executing now 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.430
 we wait for you to start all this yes 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.770
 very well is already installed and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.780
 it will automatically open very well 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.290
 Here what we are going to do is look for 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.840
 that application that today forgive this is 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.360
 open so it closes ok they close it here 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.729
 let's find the program or the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.550
 application that does not want to be left 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.780
 uninstall so let me see if what 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.780
 you can find here 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.040
 ok is here is free hide folder what 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.550
 let's do now is to give in 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.770
 Quick uninstall to ok another way 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.560
 to uninstall good another way not but 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 that if you still can not say it salar 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.120
 they select the program and they give it in 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.069
 forced uninstallation and here no forgiveness 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.890
 forgiveness and forced situation to him 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.769
 they give in examining and if not me 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.800
 wrong they look for the program is not true 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.190
 Aja and they give him in forced uninstallation 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.709
 ok that's just in case it does not stop like that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.390
 only but in this case the majority of 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.700
 Sometimes it should work ok 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.170
 they select their program and if they want 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.510
 uninstall several at the same time 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.489
 then select the boxes 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.549
 by first checking here to uninstall in 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.819
 lots ok in this case we do not mark 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.739

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.260

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.680
 we give in deep scan so that 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.140
 delete any file that you have left 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.040
 before its use although we would expect a 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.040
 little charge here 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.750
 and here we are going to mark all we give in 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.790
