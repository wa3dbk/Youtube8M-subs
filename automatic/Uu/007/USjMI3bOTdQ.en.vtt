things that I like to show is with the
different<00:01:55.920> notes<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.460> still<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
different notes you can still have the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.850 
different notes you can still have the
pinched<00:01:57.360> harmonics<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:58.020> rolling<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> with

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
pinched harmonics the rolling and with

pinched harmonics the rolling and with
the<00:01:58.950> articulate<00:01:59.430> picking<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.300> can<00:02:00.480> still

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the articulate picking you can still

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.000 
the articulate picking you can still
hear<00:02:00.990> everything<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.890> normally

you know people that are familiar with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.070 
you know people that are familiar with
autumns<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.300> are<00:02:06.420> people<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.720> are<00:02:06.780> really

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
autumns and are people that are really

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.219 
autumns and are people that are really
into<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> different<00:02:08.429> diverse<00:02:08.550> metal

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
into a lot of different diverse metal

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.620 
into a lot of different diverse metal
there's<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.290> lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.679> pickup<00:02:10.950> changes<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.760> when

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
there's a lot of pickup changes and when

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.810 
there's a lot of pickup changes and when
it<00:02:12.720> comes<00:02:12.930> down<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> lead<00:02:13.560> playing<00:02:14.040> one<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
it comes down to lead playing one of the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.340 
it comes down to lead playing one of the
things<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.240> fell<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.630> love<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:15.900> right

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
things that I fell in love with right

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.890 
things that I fell in love with right
off<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.740> bat<00:02:16.950> was<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.270> really

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
off the bat was that you can really

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.020 
off the bat was that you can really
utilize<00:02:19.170> your<00:02:19.560> pickup<00:02:19.920> switching<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.850> as

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
utilize your pickup switching just as

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.570 
utilize your pickup switching just as
you<00:02:21.150> would<00:02:21.330> before<00:02:21.510> with<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> 81<00:02:22.230> or<00:02:22.410> 85<00:02:22.890> but

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you would before with the 81 or 85 but

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.850 
you would before with the 81 or 85 but
you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.820> become<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> little<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.570> more<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.620> guess

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
you can become a little bit more I guess

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.590 
you can become a little bit more I guess
you<00:02:26.070> would<00:02:26.190> say<00:02:26.340> velocity-sensitive<00:02:27.150> with

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you would say velocity-sensitive with

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.540 
you would say velocity-sensitive with
this<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.170> as<00:02:28.680> light<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.310> want<00:02:29.459> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
this with this as light as you want to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:03:15.090 
this with this as light as you want to
pick<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.970> as<00:02:30.750> hard<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.350> want<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.620> pick

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.260 

now<00:03:16.100> as<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.340> saw<00:03:16.520> was<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> lot<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:16.970> heavy

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
now as you saw was a lot of heavy

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.100 
now as you saw was a lot of heavy
picking<00:03:17.780> as<00:03:17.960> well<00:03:18.380> as<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.560> bit<00:03:18.740> of<00:03:18.830> legato<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
picking as well as a bit of legato and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.090 
picking as well as a bit of legato and
softening<00:03:21.110> up<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.350> little<00:03:21.530> bit<00:03:21.710> for<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:21.980> sake

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
softening up a little bit for the sake

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.100 
softening up a little bit for the sake
of<00:03:22.160> dynamic<00:03:22.820> without<00:03:23.210> even<00:03:23.600> touching<00:03:23.780> my

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
of dynamic without even touching my

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.500 
of dynamic without even touching my
volume<00:03:24.530> knob<00:03:24.710> it<00:03:25.280> was<00:03:25.460> all<00:03:25.700> right<00:03:25.940> there<00:03:26.210> just

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
volume knob it was all right there just

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.290 
volume knob it was all right there just
because<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.050> very<00:03:27.620> natural<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.460> it<00:03:28.940> reacts

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
because it is very natural and it reacts

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.420 
because it is very natural and it reacts
in<00:03:29.630> many<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> same<00:03:30.590> ways<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.890> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
in many of the same ways that a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.750 
in many of the same ways that a
traditional<00:03:32.090> passive<00:03:32.390> may<00:03:32.720> work<00:03:32.960> but<00:03:33.760> having

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
traditional passive may work but having

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.810 
traditional passive may work but having
the<00:03:35.420> power<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.710> articulation<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:37.640> the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
the power the articulation and the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.020 
the power the articulation and the
clarity<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.680> only<00:03:39.890> EMG<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.580> offer<00:03:40.730> an

clarity of that only EMG can offer an

thing<00:03:44.120> about<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.510> X's<00:03:44.930> from<00:03:45.560> EMG<00:03:46.130> is<00:03:46.690> when

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
thing about the X's from EMG is when

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.090 
thing about the X's from EMG is when
with<00:03:47.960> a<00:03:48.020> band<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.350> autumn's<00:03:48.740> em<00:03:48.920> where<00:03:49.070> we

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
with a band like autumn's em where we

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.910 
with a band like autumn's em where we
utilize<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.640> lot<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.090> heavy<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.900> clean<00:03:51.260> changes

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
utilize a lot of heavy to clean changes

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.070 
utilize a lot of heavy to clean changes
live<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.760> can't<00:03:53.000> always<00:03:53.150> bring<00:03:53.510> an<00:03:53.630> acoustic

lot of the regional gigs so this is a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.000 
lot of the regional gigs so this is a
great<00:03:59.240> pickup<00:03:59.750> because<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.200> its<00:04:00.320> sensitivity

and its wide range of frequencies it's a

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.590 
and its wide range of frequencies it's a
great<00:04:03.590> pickup<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.070> compensate<00:04:04.670> for<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:04.910> what

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600
