00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
experience of that in my childhood we

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.910 
experience of that in my childhood we

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
did a lot of that and it was a lot of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
did a lot of that and it was a lot of
fun<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.430> having<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.060> tool<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.570> just

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
fun and having a tool like this just

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.220 
fun and having a tool like this just
means<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.769> always<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.869> somewhere<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.109> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
means you always have somewhere that you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.100 
means you always have somewhere that you
can<00:00:31.380> search<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.130> find<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> nearby<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.750> I

can search to find what is nearby so I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.740

and you can tap on any of these and we

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.429 
and you can tap on any of these and we
can<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.460> of

can see that we have a lot of
availabilities<00:01:43.439> around<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.159> different

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
availabilities around here different

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
availabilities around here different
places<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.600> stop<00:01:45.899> off<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.439> some<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
places that we can stop off at some of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.130 
places that we can stop off at some of
them<00:01:47.670> being<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.299> close<00:01:48.570> some<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> them

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
them being really close some of them

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
them being really close some of them
even<00:01:49.320> being<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> road<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.490> 30-40

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
even being up the road about 30-40

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.929 
even being up the road about 30-40
minutes<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.079> gives<00:01:52.290> us<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.740> nice<00:01:52.979> broad

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
minutes so it gives us a nice broad
