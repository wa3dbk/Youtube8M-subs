 matías bio facundo baby and good the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.400
 development was a half-locked circuit 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.670
 that we work it from the race of 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.940
 entry 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.690
 the machine walked them good and good 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.640
 we won 3 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.340
 stages and we won the classification for 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.800
 that the nothing strong boat that happened in the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.720
 good motorization we put a little bit of 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.500
 Endeavor since we have the burden of carrying 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.470
 the sponsor of galas tv and parallel zero 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.300
 so we could not stop accelerating and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.200
 that's what we did accelerate and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.960
 accelerate so we win the three stages 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.240
 well deserved it seems to me that we have the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.430
 triumph in this way finalized the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.740
 fourth date of the Argentine championship of 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.670
