 also the backpack can be fastened on the back 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.980
 for this we enter the inventory and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.980
 move the backpack in the shirt slot 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.369

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.330
 open it we need to press the db key 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.720

 enlarged backpack here it looks like this 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.150
 it has even more space as we see 54 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.799
 cages for various items which 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.009
 we can fold it I already showed how 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.040
 it is used here 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.689
 treated leather so that treatment 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.159
 to get such treated skin 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.159
 first create 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:56.890
 there is no wrong mistake here 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:02.890
 skin bound skin create bound 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 skin like this 7 threads and 2 skin 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.989
 got bound skin and already using 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.260
 burns bound skin we get 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.260
 treated skin 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.480
 crafted from a large chest, my great 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.660
 backpack 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.069
 such a big backpack let's go further what 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.019
 still there is a backpack like any backpack 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.239
 You can paint it like this when 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.390
 when crafting and then sport is also possible 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.160
 will color if between 8 skins 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.250
 put any dye then we get 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:51.930
 painted rexar we will dress it 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.930
 It looks like they look well 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.970
 I wanted to painted apparently the color is only 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.780
 in order for yourself to know what 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.780
 in this lies 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.290
 I also say that later you can 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.690
 color the backpack like this 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.830
 make up is set a backpack and 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.690
 dye backpack can be any color even 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.830
 color varnish can be painted any other 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.370
 color and also can create more 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.850
 larger large backpack 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.850
 placing the dye 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:36.159
 another type of backpack is a backpack edge 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:39.109
 such a backpack grafica like this 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:42.079
 in the middle and 8 of the skin we set 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:46.599
 the trunk of the ender its feature is that 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.260
 he as well as the chest of ender the contents of all 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.000
 such backpacks 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.549
 anywhere wherever they are 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.669
 always the same here in my 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.780
 There are some potato items in the chest. 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:03.680
 and 7 rotten flesh let's say left this 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.199
 chest here backpack chests and friend 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.870
 coffer another backpack leandro open 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:13.449
 his all the same items are allowed 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.449
 Now we choose left here so alone 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:26.210
 in this backpack will be the same go 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:27.050
 further discoloration of the backpack that is 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.289
 just to 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.000
 repaint the painted backpack in the usual 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.979
 turn used leather 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.050
 together with a colored backpack and as i have 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.560
 said that a backpack of any color can 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.880
 repaint another color and the most 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.880
 the last kind of backpack is 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.229
 it is not and this improvement 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.030
 backpack 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.810
 i.e 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.550
 you can install a backpack to this day and and 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.400
 put 8 skin and get more 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.500
 backpack here as if snag because 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.200
 we can get a big backpack and here 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.970
 so why should we spend on 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.890
 need another backpack and don't understand but 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.750
 although if we put there painted 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.380
 backpack then we get a big dyed 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.210
 backpack or while running if players 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.680
 what we have is reluctance to lay it out 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.080
 but you need to increase the backpack when you can 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:34.820
 take advantage of this increase so i 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:38.650
 I did not tell about the backpack with a workbench 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:44.810
 he looks like this with such a backpack 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:49.760
 you can open can craft items 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.340
 directly without opening just by just clicking 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.200
 right click here we got 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.450
 and right here we can something 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.849
 craft for example a backpack backpack 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:07.779
 crafted backpack 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:07.779
 can also get a big backpack 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:18.229
 the workbench is done like this 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.550
 treated leather and workbench got 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.440
 big 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.440
 backpack with a workbench open it 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.870
 same 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.280
 so it is not yet clear 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:45.190
 okay, that's the end of the fashion review
