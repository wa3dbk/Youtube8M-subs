00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.580 

 lift<00:01:35.640> right<00:01:35.910> up<00:01:37.490> ok<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.900> ribbon

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
 lift right up ok this is the ribbon

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
 lift right up ok this is the ribbon
cable<00:01:40.980> that<00:01:41.190> connects<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.730> motherboard

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
cable that connects to the motherboard

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:53.860 
cable that connects to the motherboard
I'm<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.780> gonna

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.620 

so<00:01:54.870> this<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.230> this<00:01:56.300> is<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.450> network<00:01:59.630> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so this so this is the network the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.990 
so this so this is the network the
canonical<00:02:05.930> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.050> see<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.410> back<00:02:07.590> in

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
canonical going to see the back in

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:25.820 
canonical going to see the back in
through<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.300> out

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830 

first<00:02:26.520> thing<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.090> always<00:02:27.180> get

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
first thing to do is I always get

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.460 
first thing to do is I always get
practice<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> test<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.520> before<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.470> put

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
practice just to test it before you put

00:02:31.470 --> 00:03:02.960 
practice just to test it before you put
everything<00:02:31.590> maquina

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.620 

so<00:03:03.540> now<00:03:03.690> we're<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.050> getting<00:03:04.410> any<00:03:04.620> sticky<00:03:05.190> keys

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
so now we're not getting any sticky keys

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.140 
so now we're not getting any sticky keys
that's<00:03:06.630> actually<00:03:06.810> doing<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.710> heavy<00:03:07.860> price<00:03:08.160> so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that's actually doing it heavy price so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.300 
that's actually doing it heavy price so
what's<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> keyboard<00:03:10.260> issue<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.890> now<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.100> just

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
what's the keyboard issue so now we just

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.020 
what's the keyboard issue so now we just
gotta<00:03:11.520> power<00:03:12.390> back<00:03:12.630> down<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.920> finish<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
gotta power back down and finish the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:28.340 
gotta power back down and finish the
