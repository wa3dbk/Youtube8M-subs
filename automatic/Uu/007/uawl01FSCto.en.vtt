that they're probably a little bit

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
that they're probably a little bit
better<00:01:03.570> than<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.900> latter<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:05.280> really

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

a hard molded insert here on the toe

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.900 
a hard molded insert here on the toe
that's<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.710> good<00:03:35.860> thing<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.400> then<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.760> does

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
that's a good thing and then it does

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.850 
that's a good thing and then it does
have<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> toe<00:03:37.510> protector<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.260> one<00:03:38.710> of<00:03:38.740> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
have a toe protector this is one of the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.580 
have a toe protector this is one of the
features<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.570> seems<00:03:40.570> rather<00:03:40.840> obvious<00:03:41.140> but

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
features that seems rather obvious but

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.520 
features that seems rather obvious but
the<00:03:41.770> balance<00:03:42.640> oiled<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.480> balanced<00:03:44.110> protec

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
the balance oiled and balanced protec

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.990 
the balance oiled and balanced protec
boots<00:03:44.770> are<00:03:44.950> really<00:03:44.980> lacking<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.940> this

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
boots are really lacking that and this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.720 
boots are really lacking that and this
is<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> nice<00:03:46.750> feature<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.350> former<00:03:48.010> was<00:03:48.160> keen<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
is a nice feature and former was keen to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.630 
is a nice feature and former was keen to
point<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.270> out<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.720> us<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:51.190> here's<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.400> couple

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
point this out to us but here's a couple

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.090 
point this out to us but here's a couple
of<00:03:51.790> things<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.330> are<00:03:52.990> really<00:03:53.530> important

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
of things that are really important

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.790 
of things that are really important
about<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.400> construction<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.300> that<00:03:55.930> that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
about the construction of this that that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.390 
about the construction of this that that
you<00:03:56.890> need<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.430> need<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.640> know<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:59.050> has<00:03:59.400> molded

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
you need you need to know it has molded

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.420 
you need you need to know it has molded
inserts<00:04:00.910> here<00:04:01.360> on<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.660> outer<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.290> also<00:04:03.190> on

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
inserts here on the outer and also on

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.000 
inserts here on the outer and also on
the<00:04:03.640> inner<00:04:03.850> ankle<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.870> that's<00:04:05.500> good<00:04:05.710> because

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
the inner ankle and that's good because

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.070 
the inner ankle and that's good because
there's<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.460> good<00:04:07.060> amount<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.540> ankle<00:04:07.900> support

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
there's a good amount of ankle support

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.570 
there's a good amount of ankle support
on<00:04:08.440> this<00:04:08.620> but<00:04:08.770> when<00:04:08.860> you<00:04:08.950> clamp<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.370> it's

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
on this but when you clamp it down it's

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.730 
on this but when you clamp it down it's
really<00:04:09.940> hard<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.510> roll<00:04:10.810> your<00:04:11.110> ankle<00:04:11.230> in<00:04:11.560> in

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
really hard to roll your ankle in in

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.890 
really hard to roll your ankle in in
this<00:04:11.980> way<00:04:12.340> let's<00:04:12.970> get<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.120> good<00:04:13.270> support<00:04:13.720> around

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
this way let's get a good support around

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.610 
this way let's get a good support around
the<00:04:14.050> ankle<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:15.130> midsole<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:17.049> boot<00:04:17.230> is

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
the ankle the midsole on this boot is

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.000 
the ankle the midsole on this boot is
fairly<00:04:18.040> rigid<00:04:18.400> from<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.600> heel<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.560> about<00:04:20.770> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
fairly rigid from the heel to about the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.460 
fairly rigid from the heel to about the
middle<00:04:21.400> under<00:04:21.790> your<00:04:21.940> arch<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:23.260> that's

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
middle under your arch and so that's

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.680 
middle under your arch and so that's
good<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:23.710> standing<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.520> pegs<00:04:24.790> we've<00:04:25.480> worn

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
good for standing on the pegs we've worn

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.270 
good for standing on the pegs we've worn
these<00:04:25.810> boots<00:04:26.050> for<00:04:26.230> many<00:04:26.380> many<00:04:26.860> full<00:04:27.070> days

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
these boots for many many full days

riding I have a pair personally that

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.519 
riding I have a pair personally that
I've<00:04:29.680> had<00:04:29.919> since<00:04:30.610> about<00:04:31.080> 2008<00:04:32.080> or<00:04:32.320> two

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
I've had since about 2008 or two

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.399 
I've had since about 2008 or two
9<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.249> probably<00:04:33.669> have<00:04:33.999> two<00:04:34.539> thousand<00:04:35.049> three

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
9 I probably have two thousand three

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.109 
9 I probably have two thousand three
thousand<00:04:35.889> miles<00:04:36.069> on<00:04:36.279> them<00:04:36.519> they're<00:04:36.819> holding

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:37.119 
thousand miles on them they're holding

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:38.459 
thousand miles on them they're holding
up<00:04:37.209> well<00:04:37.359> I've<00:04:37.599> used<00:04:37.779> them<00:04:37.929> a<00:04:37.959> bunch<00:04:38.139> I<00:04:38.289> really

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 
up well I've used them a bunch I really

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.489 
up well I've used them a bunch I really
like<00:04:38.619> them<00:04:38.769> but<00:04:39.459> the<00:04:39.939> forefoot<00:04:40.479> area<00:04:40.869> on<00:04:41.049> this

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:41.499 
like them but the forefoot area on this

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.969 
like them but the forefoot area on this
is<00:04:41.879> pretty<00:04:42.879> soft<00:04:43.209> and<00:04:43.569> so<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.379> get<00:04:44.559> a<00:04:44.589> lot<00:04:44.859> of

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
is pretty soft and so you get a lot of

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.009 
is pretty soft and so you get a lot of
flex<00:04:45.279> at<00:04:45.519> the<00:04:45.549> toe<00:04:45.879> and<00:04:46.149> that<00:04:46.509> makes<00:04:46.749> the<00:04:46.929> boot

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:47.019 
flex at the toe and that makes the boot

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.959 
flex at the toe and that makes the boot
quite<00:04:47.349> easy<00:04:47.589> to<00:04:47.889> walk<00:04:48.069> in<00:04:48.159> we'll<00:04:48.429> get<00:04:48.609> back<00:04:48.789> to

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
quite easy to walk in we'll get back to

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.889 
quite easy to walk in we'll get back to
that<00:04:49.119> later<00:04:49.529> but<00:04:50.789> you<00:04:51.789> know<00:04:51.939> overall<00:04:52.719> the

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:52.899 
that later but you know overall the

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.169 
that later but you know overall the
construction<00:04:53.679> of<00:04:53.769> this<00:04:53.919> boot<00:04:54.189> is<00:04:54.369> a<00:04:54.699> nice

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:55.179 
construction of this boot is a nice

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:59.609 
construction of this boot is a nice
blend<00:04:55.659> a<00:04:56.369> uniquely<00:04:57.369> clever<00:04:58.149> blend<00:04:58.539> of<00:04:58.809> support

00:04:59.609 --> 00:04:59.619 
blend a uniquely clever blend of support

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:01.799 
blend a uniquely clever blend of support
around<00:04:59.739> the<00:04:59.979> ankle<00:05:00.369> and<00:05:00.489> flex<00:05:01.059> at<00:05:01.269> the<00:05:01.359> toe<00:05:01.569> in

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:01.809 
around the ankle and flex at the toe in

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:04.289 
around the ankle and flex at the toe in
fact<00:05:02.409> this<00:05:03.129> really<00:05:03.429> feels<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.909> lot<00:05:04.029> like<00:05:04.269> a

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:04.299 
fact this really feels a lot like a

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:06.899 
fact this really feels a lot like a
hiking<00:05:04.749> shoe<00:05:04.959> weight<00:05:05.889> of<00:05:06.099> it<00:05:06.219> is<00:05:06.339> quite<00:05:06.669> good

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
hiking shoe weight of it is quite good

hiking shoe weight of it is quite good

thirteen point seven five we'll talk
about<00:05:23.859> conversion<00:05:24.339> a<00:05:24.519> little<00:05:24.729> bit<00:05:24.819> later<00:05:24.969> but

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:25.179 
about conversion a little bit later but

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.229 
about conversion a little bit later but
this<00:05:25.479> does<00:05:25.749> come<00:05:25.959> in<00:05:26.229> fairly<00:05:26.769> a<00:05:27.099> fairly<00:05:27.759> broad

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:28.239 
this does come in fairly a fairly broad

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:30.059 
this does come in fairly a fairly broad
range<00:05:28.569> of<00:05:28.749> sizes<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.319> then<00:05:29.409> of<00:05:29.529> course<00:05:29.739> one<00:05:30.039> of

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
range of sizes and then of course one of

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.829 
range of sizes and then of course one of
the<00:05:30.219> most<00:05:30.369> important<00:05:30.909> things<00:05:31.119> and<00:05:31.329> this<00:05:31.659> is

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:31.839 
the most important things and this is

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.269 
the most important things and this is
something<00:05:32.019> that<00:05:32.259> we<00:05:32.319> generally<00:05:32.649> look<00:05:32.919> for<00:05:32.949> and

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
something that we generally look for and

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.309 
something that we generally look for and
most<00:05:33.789> of<00:05:33.939> the<00:05:34.029> boots<00:05:34.209> we<00:05:34.389> sell<00:05:34.599> it<00:05:34.749> has<00:05:34.899> a<00:05:34.929> nice

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
most of the boots we sell it has a nice

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.549 
most of the boots we sell it has a nice
wide<00:05:36.099> toe<00:05:36.610> box<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:37.479> this<00:05:37.599> boot<00:05:37.749> is<00:05:37.899> quite<00:05:38.259> good

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:38.559 
wide toe box so this boot is quite good

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:43.870 
wide toe box so this boot is quite good
if<00:05:38.829> you<00:05:39.279> have<00:05:39.459> a<00:05:39.489> wide<00:05:39.879> foot
