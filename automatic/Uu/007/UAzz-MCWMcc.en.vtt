00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
it differs from the new Lumia 920

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.460 
it differs from the new Lumia 920
because<00:00:27.070> there<00:00:27.610> is<00:00:27.760> no<00:00:28.060> micro<00:00:28.660> USB<00:00:29.110> port<00:00:29.380> at

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
because there is no micro USB port at

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.670 
because there is no micro USB port at
the<00:00:29.500> bottom<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.670> 3.5<00:00:31.270> mm<00:00:31.810> jack<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.379> the

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
the bottom and the 3.5 mm jack and the

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
the bottom and the 3.5 mm jack and the
SIM<00:00:32.920> slots<00:00:33.219> are<00:00:33.460> on<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.570> top<00:00:34.780> if<00:00:35.710> you<00:00:35.800> can<00:00:36.040> see

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
SIM slots are on the top if you can see

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.990 
SIM slots are on the top if you can see
this<00:00:37.690> is<00:00:37.840> our<00:00:38.050> 920<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.430> this<00:00:39.579> is<00:00:39.670> running

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
this is our 920 so this is running

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.240 
this is our 920 so this is running
Windows<00:00:40.300> 8<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.590> can<00:00:41.740> see<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> clear

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
Windows 8 you can see the clear

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.400 
Windows 8 you can see the clear
difference<00:00:42.400> is<00:00:42.730> also<00:00:43.180> slightly<00:00:43.780> thick<00:00:44.230> our

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
difference is also slightly thick our

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.800 
difference is also slightly thick our
device<00:00:44.740> so<00:00:45.550> anyway<00:00:45.970> let's<00:00:46.150> get<00:00:46.270> down<00:00:46.329> to<00:00:46.690> the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
device so anyway let's get down to the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.600

super lodge to regular size or ultra

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.999 
super lodge to regular size or ultra
small<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:34.959> have<00:01:35.139> a<00:01:35.170> new<00:01:35.439> start<00:01:35.799> screen

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
small so you have a new start screen

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.209 
small so you have a new start screen
here<00:01:36.759> which<00:01:37.749> is<00:01:37.899> pretty<00:01:38.139> much<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.560> main<00:01:38.920> thing

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
here which is pretty much the main thing

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.260 
here which is pretty much the main thing
you<00:01:39.399> get<00:01:39.549> with<00:01:39.789> in<00:01:40.090> those<00:01:40.859> 7.8<00:01:41.859> a<00:01:42.609> couple<00:01:43.179> of

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
you get with in those 7.8 a couple of

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.789 
you get with in those 7.8 a couple of
things<00:01:43.389> you<00:01:43.539> will<00:01:43.719> find<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.229> no<00:01:44.529> key<00:01:44.709> has

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
things you will find is that no key has

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.419 
things you will find is that no key has
added<00:01:45.189> some<00:01:45.789> additives<00:01:46.299> in<00:01:46.569> terms<00:01:47.020> of

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
added some additives in terms of

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.969 
added some additives in terms of
software<00:01:48.429> so<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.759> have<00:01:48.999> software<00:01:49.509> like<00:01:49.979> this

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
software so you have software like this

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.999 
software so you have software like this
which<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.340> called<00:01:52.439> from<00:01:53.439> what<00:01:53.590> mistake<00:01:53.889> you

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
which is called from what mistake you

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.469 
which is called from what mistake you
that's<00:01:54.219> called<00:01:54.490> contact<00:01:56.789> sorry<00:01:57.789> counter<00:01:58.209> no

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
that's called contact sorry counter no

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.539 
that's called contact sorry counter no
contact<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.439> what<00:01:59.560> counter<00:01:59.889> does<00:02:00.069> so<00:02:00.310> it

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
contact and what counter does so it

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.849 
contact and what counter does so it
shows<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:01.060> how<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.240> manage<00:02:01.719> your<00:02:01.899> usage<00:02:02.619> so

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
shows you how to manage your usage so

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.219 
shows you how to manage your usage so
instead<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.429> you<00:02:03.579> have<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.909> data<00:02:04.149> sense<00:02:04.479> no

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
instead of you have in data sense no

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.139 
instead of you have in data sense no
keys<00:02:05.439> provided<00:02:05.889> something<00:02:06.099> that<00:02:06.459> does<00:02:07.029> the

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
keys provided something that does the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.949

calls messages and data you can actually

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.150 
calls messages and data you can actually
set<00:02:13.390> your<00:02:13.599> limits
