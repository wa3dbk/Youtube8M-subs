00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.099 
change that I wouldn't really recommend
it<00:03:02.709> because<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.070> changes<00:03:03.880> your<00:03:04.120> your<00:03:04.450> stats

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
it because it changes your your stats

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
but if you have a certain set you want

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.190 
but if you have a certain set you want
to<00:03:06.489> change<00:03:06.700> then<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.630> know<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.019> go<00:03:08.079> ahead

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
to change then you know you can go ahead

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.289 
to change then you know you can go ahead
and<00:03:08.380> do<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.760> makes<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.120> small

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
and do that but it makes a small

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.630 
and do that but it makes a small
difference<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:11.799> heritage<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.370> can<00:03:12.519> go
