I think replaces this and that is about

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.890 
I think replaces this and that is about
a<00:02:58.340> thousand<00:02:58.760> dollars<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.359> if<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.689> anything

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
a thousand dollars and if it's anything
