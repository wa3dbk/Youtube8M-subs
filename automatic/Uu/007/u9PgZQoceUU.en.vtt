hey guys Devin here with aDNA offer up
and<00:00:02.879> today<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.210> was<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.780> through<00:00:03.899> some<00:00:04.140> old

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
and today I was going through some old

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.320 
and today I was going through some old
video<00:00:04.529> files<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.279> found<00:00:05.640> some<00:00:05.850> clips<00:00:06.150> from

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
video files and I found some clips from

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.030 
video files and I found some clips from
when<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.600> put<00:00:06.870> frame<00:00:07.140> stiffeners<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.680> brach

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
when I put frame stiffeners and brach

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.530 
when I put frame stiffeners and brach
sliders<00:00:08.460> on<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.639> Cherokee<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> thought

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
sliders on the Cherokee so I thought

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.570 
sliders on the Cherokee so I thought
I've<00:00:09.630> shared<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.580> unfortunately

to<00:00:15.570> my<00:00:15.690> welding<00:00:16.020> part<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to my welding part but I have all the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.550 
to my welding part but I have all the
preparation<00:00:18.420> process<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.140> some<00:00:19.230> before<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
preparation process and some before and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250 
preparation process and some before and
after<00:00:20.010> pictures<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.300> welding<00:00:21.630> itself<00:00:22.140> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
after pictures the welding itself is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.560 
after pictures the welding itself is
pretty<00:00:22.470> easy<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.189> weld<00:00:23.570> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
pretty easy if you know how to weld the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.349 
pretty easy if you know how to weld the
process<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.439> easier<00:00:25.710> if<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.490> two

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
process is a lot easier if you have two

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
process is a lot easier if you have two
jacks<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> buddy<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.189> jack

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
jacks so you got a buddy with the jack

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
jacks so you got a buddy with the jack
you<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> jacks<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.750> home<00:00:30.929> it's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you just have to jacks at home it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you can just blow them on I opted in to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.330 
you can just blow them on I opted in to
weld<00:01:05.580> mine<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.930> sliders<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.710> homemade<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
weld mine on my sliders for homemade and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640 
weld mine on my sliders for homemade and
so<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> didn't<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.450> anything<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.229> self

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so I didn't put anything for self

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.510 
so I didn't put anything for self
tappers<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> there

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
tappers in there

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
tappers in there
and<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> pain<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710

have<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> drill<00:01:14.220> through<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.580> slider<00:01:14.970> your

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
have to drill through your slider your

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.050 
have to drill through your slider your
stiffeners<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.860> unibody<00:01:17.220> itself<00:01:17.729> it's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
stiffeners and a unibody itself it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.429 
stiffeners and a unibody itself it's
just<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> lot<00:01:18.420> tougher<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:18.750> you'll<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.290> your

someone are a little bit thinner than
that<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.649> one

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
that there's one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.940 
that there's one
companies<00:01:44.510> that<00:01:44.660> make<00:01:44.870> stiffeners<00:01:45.710> for<00:01:45.890> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
companies that make stiffeners for the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.000 
companies that make stiffeners for the
charities<00:01:46.400> i<00:01:46.670> often<00:01:47.300> with<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.540> rough<00:01:47.720> stuff

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
charities i often with the rough stuff

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.470 
charities i often with the rough stuff
one<00:01:49.010> of<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.160> main<00:01:49.280> reasons<00:01:49.640> was<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:50.150> was<00:01:50.240> thick

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
one of the main reasons was it was thick

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.900 
one of the main reasons was it was thick
and<00:01:50.690> it<00:01:51.290> had<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> holes<00:01:51.950> already<00:01:52.370> in<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
and it had a holes already in it so I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.660 
and it had a holes already in it so I
can<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.360> plug<00:01:53.990> welds<00:01:54.350> some<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.400> other<00:01:55.550> ones

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
can do plug welds some of the other ones

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.980 
can do plug welds some of the other ones
don't<00:01:55.880> really<00:01:56.090> have<00:01:56.210> those<00:01:56.390> holes<00:01:56.570> on<00:01:56.810> there

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
don't really have those holes on there

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.060 
don't really have those holes on there
so<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.290> either<00:01:57.380> have<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:57.680> drill<00:01:57.950> them

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
so you either have to drill them

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.540 
so you either have to drill them
yourself<00:01:58.400> or<00:01:58.760> go<00:01:59.000> without<00:01:59.800> so<00:02:00.800> if<00:02:01.190> you're

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
yourself or go without so if you're

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.920 
yourself or go without so if you're
still<00:02:01.880> hanging<00:02:02.150> around<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.660> want<00:02:02.750> to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
still hanging around and you want to

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.720 
still hanging around and you want to
watch<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.350> preparation<00:02:03.920> process<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.610> some

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
watch the preparation process and some

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:16.720 
watch the preparation process and some
before<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.150> after<00:02:05.360> pictures<00:02:15.400> before<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.610> can

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
before and after pictures before we can

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.610 
before and after pictures before we can
start<00:02:16.910> welding<00:02:17.180> our<00:02:17.450> unibody<00:02:17.870> stiffeners<00:02:18.410> on

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
start welding our unibody stiffeners on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.500 
start welding our unibody stiffeners on
or<00:02:18.860> our<00:02:18.950> frame<00:02:19.220> stiffeners<00:02:19.670> first<00:02:20.240> thing<00:02:20.390> we

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
or our frame stiffeners first thing we

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.940 
or our frame stiffeners first thing we
have<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:21.020> remove<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.680> under

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
have to do is remove all this under

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.230 
have to do is remove all this under
coating<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.460> can<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:22.880> kind<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
coating you can see it's kind of a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.510 
coating you can see it's kind of a
textured<00:02:23.720> coating<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.040> bottom<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.460> the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
textured coating on the bottom of the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520 
textured coating on the bottom of the
unibody<00:02:25.910> rails<00:02:26.240> that's<00:02:27.020> got<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.290> come<00:02:27.380> off

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
unibody rails that's got to come off

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.260 
unibody rails that's got to come off
before<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.190> weld<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.700> can't<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.060> weld

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
before we can weld you can't really weld

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.180 
before we can weld you can't really weld
through<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.440> also<00:02:30.650> makes<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
through it and it also makes the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.190 
through it and it also makes the
stiffeners<00:02:31.850> not<00:02:32.060> sit<00:02:32.390> quite<00:02:32.630> well<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:32.840> there

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
stiffeners not sit quite well on there

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.420 
stiffeners not sit quite well on there
so<00:02:33.380> what<00:02:33.680> I'm<00:02:33.770> going<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.190> I'm<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.150 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> an<00:02:35.330> angle<00:02:35.960> grinder<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.650> wire<00:02:36.860> wheel

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
take a an angle grinder and a wire wheel

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.190 
take a an angle grinder and a wire wheel
and<00:02:37.460> see<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.270> take<00:02:38.420> all<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.750> underbody

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
and see if I can take all that underbody

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:52.059 
and see if I can take all that underbody
coating<00:02:39.650> off

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.050 

you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so now we got the unibody rails all

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.069 
so now we got the unibody rails all
cleaned<00:02:57.280> up<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.670> next<00:02:58.360> thing<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.569> got<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.810> do<00:02:58.930> is

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
take off my control arm drop box braces

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.250 
take off my control arm drop box braces
so<00:03:03.069> we're<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.610> driver<00:03:04.030> side<00:03:04.150> here<00:03:04.390> there's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
so we're on the driver side here there's

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.619 
so we're on the driver side here there's
my<00:03:05.500> control<00:03:05.920> arm<00:03:06.129> there's<00:03:06.459> my<00:03:06.640> drop<00:03:06.939> box<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
my control arm there's my drop box and

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.319 
my control arm there's my drop box and
here's<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.319> brace<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.950> goes<00:03:09.129> on<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.519> take

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
here's this brace that goes on it take

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.300 
here's this brace that goes on it take
it<00:03:10.450> off<00:03:10.569> I<00:03:10.750> got<00:03:10.989> four<00:03:11.230> bolts<00:03:11.379> on<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.799> side<00:03:12.040> and

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
it off I got four bolts on this side and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.270 
it off I got four bolts on this side and
two<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.659> go<00:03:13.780> into<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.230> crossmember<00:03:15.099> there

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
two that go into the crossmember there

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.699 
two that go into the crossmember there
so<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.299> got<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:16.659> those<00:03:16.870> off<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.530> that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
way I'm going to be able to take off the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.710 
way I'm going to be able to take off the
brace<00:03:21.310> there<00:03:21.640> that's<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.450> allow<00:03:22.540> me<00:03:22.569> to

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
brace there that's going to allow me to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
brace there that's going to allow me to
get<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.109> front<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.439> the<00:03:23.500> unibody<00:03:23.890> rail<00:03:24.189> so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
get to the front of the unibody rail so

get to the front of the unibody rail so
if<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:24.909> look<00:03:25.060> over<00:03:25.269> here<00:03:25.329> on<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.140> passenger

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
if you look over here on the passenger

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.339 
if you look over here on the passenger
side<00:03:27.010> I've<00:03:27.670> already<00:03:28.060> done<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.420> sorry<00:03:28.900> it's<00:03:29.109> a

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.039 
side I've already done that sorry it's a
little<00:03:29.500> dark<00:03:29.890> outside<00:03:30.069> it's<00:03:30.370> about<00:03:30.400> 6:00<00:03:30.760> a.m.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
little dark outside it's about 6:00 a.m.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.780 
little dark outside it's about 6:00 a.m.
so<00:03:32.049> I'm<00:03:32.109> working<00:03:32.260> with<00:03:32.409> a<00:03:32.590> light<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:33.159> so

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
so I'm working with a light but so

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.339 
so I'm working with a light but so
here's<00:03:33.970> those<00:03:34.120> bolts<00:03:34.480> on<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.720> other<00:03:34.840> side<00:03:35.109> you

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
here's those bolts on the other side you

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.899 
here's those bolts on the other side you
can<00:03:35.379> see<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.680> now<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.010> can<00:03:36.159> get<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.670> frame

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
can see that now I can get to the frame

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.440 
can see that now I can get to the frame
rail<00:03:36.940> because<00:03:37.720> I've<00:03:38.049> taken<00:03:38.530> off<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.799> brace

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
rail because I've taken off that brace

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.729 
rail because I've taken off that brace
so<00:03:40.450> I've<00:03:40.540> got<00:03:40.659> that<00:03:40.810> control<00:03:41.139> arm<00:03:41.290> brace<00:03:41.500> off

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
so I've got that control arm brace off

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.949 
so I've got that control arm brace off
now<00:03:42.040> next<00:03:42.400> thing<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.700> going<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.849> be<00:03:43.030> priming<00:03:43.840> it

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
now next thing is going to be priming it

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.170 
now next thing is going to be priming it
since<00:03:44.859> we<00:03:44.950> took<00:03:45.069> all<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.370> metal<00:03:45.670> off<00:03:45.849> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
since we took all that metal off and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.460 
since we took all that metal off and
even<00:03:46.299> though<00:03:46.480> we're<00:03:46.659> welding<00:03:46.959> something<00:03:47.170> over

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
even though we're welding something over

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.649 
even though we're welding something over
top<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.920> we<00:03:48.430> don't<00:03:48.579> want<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.940> rust<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.629> I

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
top of it we don't want it to rust so I

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.729 
top of it we don't want it to rust so I
got<00:03:50.260> this

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
got this

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.680 
got this
let's<00:03:50.980> see<00:03:51.069> if<00:03:51.129> we<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.310> see<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:52.569> know<00:03:52.659> just

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
let's see if we can see it you know just

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.930 
let's see if we can see it you know just
rust-oleum<00:03:53.170> automobile<00:03:54.040> primer<00:03:54.340> I'm

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
rust-oleum automobile primer I'm

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.089 
rust-oleum automobile primer I'm
probably<00:03:55.120> gonna<00:03:55.329> have<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.799> take<00:03:56.799> this<00:03:56.920> off

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
probably gonna have to take this off

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.349 
probably gonna have to take this off
where<00:03:57.280> I'm<00:03:57.370> going<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.549> be<00:03:57.639> welding<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> but<00:03:58.329> I

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
where I'm going to be welding it but I

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.539 
where I'm going to be welding it but I
want<00:03:58.629> to<00:03:58.720> give<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.049> nice<00:03:59.169> quick<00:03:59.410> coat<00:03:59.650> before

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
want to give it a nice quick coat before

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.439 
want to give it a nice quick coat before
we<00:04:00.819> try<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.269> weld<00:04:01.449> anything<00:04:01.900> on<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:06.299> all<00:04:07.299> right

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
we try and weld anything on it all right

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.030 
we try and weld anything on it all right
so<00:04:07.599> everything<00:04:07.930> on<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:08.260> Jeep<00:04:08.470> now<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.889> all

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
so everything on the Jeep now is all

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.839 
so everything on the Jeep now is all
primed<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.549> ready

we got the unibody rails primered we got
the<00:04:13.440> braces<00:04:14.440> off<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:14.919> control<00:04:15.370> arm<00:04:15.400> drop

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.960 
the braces off of the control arm drop
brackets<00:04:16.359> so<00:04:16.930> we<00:04:17.109> are<00:04:17.199> ready<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.650> go<00:04:17.859> when<00:04:18.639> I<00:04:18.699> go

going to allow me to put the unibody

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.460 
going to allow me to put the unibody
stiffeners<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.240> place<00:04:28.479> there's<00:04:29.139> one<00:04:29.349> more

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
stiffeners in place there's one more

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.779 
stiffeners in place there's one more
thing<00:04:29.650> we're<00:04:29.860> going<00:04:29.979> to<00:04:30.039> actually<00:04:30.400> have<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.639> do

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
to the stiffeners since I still have my

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.020 
to the stiffeners since I still have my
short<00:04:32.949> arms<00:04:33.070> I'm<00:04:33.400> gonna<00:04:33.520> have<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.669> cut<00:04:33.849> off<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
short arms I'm gonna have to cut off the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.710 
short arms I'm gonna have to cut off the
first<00:04:34.510> about<00:04:34.870> six<00:04:35.289> inches<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:35.979> them<00:04:36.720> and

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
that's what we're gonna do next so I get

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.189 
that's what we're gonna do next so I get
the<00:04:39.880> frame<00:04:40.060> strip<00:04:40.270> Ramires<00:04:40.570> all<00:04:40.720> measured<00:04:41.050> up

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
the frame strip Ramires all measured up

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.540 
the frame strip Ramires all measured up
I<00:04:41.380> got<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> line<00:04:41.770> here<00:04:41.800> where<00:04:42.190> I'm<00:04:42.280> going<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.460> be

I got a line here where I'm going to be

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.250 
I got a line here where I'm going to be
cutting<00:04:42.760> them<00:04:42.940> again<00:04:43.720> this<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:43.990> because<00:04:44.139> I

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
cutting them again this is because I

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.129 
cutting them again this is because I
have<00:04:44.409> my<00:04:44.650> shorter<00:04:45.340> arm<00:04:45.460> still<00:04:45.789> so<00:04:46.419> this<00:04:46.900> front

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
have my shorter arm still so this front

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.600 
have my shorter arm still so this front
half<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.470> made<00:04:47.680> if<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:47.860> have<00:04:48.010> long<00:04:48.220> arms<00:04:48.520> you

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
half is made if you have long arms you

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.310 
half is made if you have long arms you
can<00:04:48.729> keep<00:04:48.849> it<00:04:48.970> on<00:04:49.060> there<00:04:49.300> if<00:04:49.510> not<00:04:49.750> you're<00:04:50.289> just

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.529 
can keep it on there if not you're just
gonna<00:04:50.500> cut<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.770> off<00:04:50.949> right<00:04:51.190> there<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.880> let's

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539
