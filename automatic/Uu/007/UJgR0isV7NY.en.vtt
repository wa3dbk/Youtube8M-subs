00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.920 

I'm<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.159> simple<00:01:36.340> ball<00:01:36.760> that<00:01:37.390> understands

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
I'm just a simple ball that understands

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.880 
I'm just a simple ball that understands
an<00:01:38.320> intimate<00:01:38.740> little<00:01:38.950> scallops

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
an intimate little scallops

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.410 
an intimate little scallops
if<00:01:41.890> usually<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.430> simply<00:01:42.909> use<00:01:43.030> me<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.180> middle

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
if usually it's simply use me a middle

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.810 
if usually it's simply use me a middle
finger<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.950> just<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.430> as<00:01:48.580> if<00:01:48.700> you're

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
finger and just do that as if you're

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:01.160 
finger and just do that as if you're
making<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.119> little<00:01:49.270> spout<00:01:49.659> all<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.229> way<00:01:50.350> around

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.840 

and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.830> once<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.159> round<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and then once you get round they just

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.200 
and then once you get round they just
got<00:02:03.000> yourself<00:02:03.090> kg<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:03.990> fits<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:04.409> even<00:02:04.620> evenly

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
got yourself kg so it fits I even evenly

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.620 
got yourself kg so it fits I even evenly
so<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.240> fit<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.720> evenly<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
so that fit so evenly so that's the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.279 
so that fit so evenly so that's the
first<00:02:09.840> one

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
first one

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.800 
first one
what's<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> sort<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.830> sculpt<00:02:11.190> th<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
what's the sort of sculpt th one the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.150 
what's the sort of sculpt th one the
next<00:02:15.959> one<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.590> simple<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.950> some

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
next one which is the simple just some

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.030 
next one which is the simple just some
thoughts<00:02:20.820> about<00:02:21.120> ten<00:02:21.540> old<00:02:21.900> thing<00:02:25.940> will<00:02:26.940> get

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
thoughts about ten old thing will get

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.140 
thoughts about ten old thing will get
I'll<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.220> slightly<00:02:29.580> different<00:02:30.060> slightly

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
I'll just slightly different slightly

00:02:30.150 --> 00:03:09.970 
I'll just slightly different slightly
more<00:02:30.540> flavor

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.370 

but<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.520> was<00:03:10.760> gonna<00:03:10.940> roll<00:03:11.150> with<00:03:11.780> over<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.140> tiny

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
but this was gonna roll with over a tiny

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.050 
but this was gonna roll with over a tiny
bit<00:03:12.650> more<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.220> bit<00:03:13.400> more<00:03:13.610> flat

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
bit more so it's a bit more flat

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.430 
bit more so it's a bit more flat
basically<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.080> feather<00:03:17.380> said<00:03:19.440> exhibition

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
basically this feather said exhibition

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.110 
basically this feather said exhibition
ladies<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.890> bow<00:03:21.100> right<00:03:21.130> now<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.670> about<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.910> nice

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
ladies a bow right now is about a nice

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:32.670 
ladies a bow right now is about a nice
Bowl<00:03:23.310> this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.590 

and<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:34.010> one<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.310> even<00:03:34.430> easier<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.850> just<00:03:35.000> to

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
and this one is even easier you just to

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.890 
and this one is even easier you just to
bigger<00:03:36.580> sort<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.640> spouts<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.540> with<00:03:38.810> the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
bigger sort of spouts in it with the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.240 
bigger sort of spouts in it with the
same<00:03:39.110> thing<00:03:39.530> with<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.710> middle<00:03:39.920> thing<00:03:40.070> they

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
same thing with you middle thing they

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.880 
same thing with you middle thing they
look<00:03:40.340> making<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.790> bit<00:03:40.940> bigger<00:03:41.620> I'm<00:03:42.620> just

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
look making it a bit bigger I'm just

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.260 
look making it a bit bigger I'm just
spreading<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:44.000> down<00:03:44.150> wide<00:03:44.360> start<00:03:46.270> the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
spreading it down wide start the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.210 
spreading it down wide start the
opposite<00:03:47.660> side

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.330 

and<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.820> gives<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.620> two<00:03:55.620> badges<00:03:55.830> like<00:03:56.010> that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and that gives you two badges like that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.980 
and that gives you two badges like that
just<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.610> little<00:03:56.760> bit<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:57.260> design<00:03:58.260> on<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.620> so

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
just a little bit of design on it so

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.540 
just a little bit of design on it so
Leslie<00:04:00.990> that's<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.770> sort<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.100> simple

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
Leslie that's it to sort of simple

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.810 
Leslie that's it to sort of simple
designs<00:04:03.450> on<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.690> same<00:04:03.900> bolt

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
designs on the same bolt

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.270
