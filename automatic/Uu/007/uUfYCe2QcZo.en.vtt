this cupboard fold and then from that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
this cupboard fold and then from that
pinch<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.110> fold<00:01:07.110> it

pinch what you're going to do is fold it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
pinch what you're going to do is fold it
up<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.340> pinch<00:01:08.760> which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
up to that pinch which is right in the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
up to that pinch which is right in the
middle<00:01:13.189> yeah<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> top<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> bottom

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
middle yeah from the top and the bottom

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
middle yeah from the top and the bottom
to<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> middle<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.619> we're<00:01:22.770> gonna<00:01:22.860> open<00:01:23.040> up

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to the middle and we're gonna open up

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.140 
to the middle and we're gonna open up
we're<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.290> edge

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
we're going to now take this edge

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
we're going to now take this edge
basically<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> fold<00:01:28.250> it'll<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.369> right

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
basically we make a fold it'll be right

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
basically we make a fold it'll be right
here<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.590> we're<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.829> do

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
here and here and the way we're gonna do

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.690 
here and here and the way we're gonna do
that<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> bring<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> crease

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that is to bring this up to the crease

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.749 
that is to bring this up to the crease
that<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.180> made<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:39.170> I'm<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> bring<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
that we made here I'm going to bring it

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
that we made here I'm going to bring it
this<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.890> other<00:01:44.040> side<00:01:47.689> then<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
this up to the other side then it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
this up to the other side then it
essentially<00:01:49.860> breaks<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> into<00:01:50.610> these<00:01:50.729> parts

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
essentially breaks it into these parts

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
essentially breaks it into these parts
here<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:52.680> we're<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.970> one

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
here now we're going to take this one

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.550 
here now we're going to take this one
corner<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:56.159> cupboard<00:01:56.460> fold<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.689> fold<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
corner that cupboard fold just fold the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.399 
corner that cupboard fold just fold the
corner<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.689> do<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:00.960> thing<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
corner down and do the same thing on the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350 
corner down and do the same thing on the
other<00:02:01.439> side<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.549> basically<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
other side but it's basically the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.760 
other side but it's basically the
opposite<00:02:03.869> corner

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.790 

and<00:02:08.250> we're<00:02:09.179> done<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.630> folding<00:02:10.229> part<00:02:10.530> all

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and we're done with the folding part all

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.660 
and we're done with the folding part all
we<00:02:10.830> need<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.280> now<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.989> insert<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.920> into

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
we need to do now is to insert this into

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.510 
we need to do now is to insert this into
this<00:02:15.300> slot<00:02:15.690> here<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:18.440> what<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.860> is

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.900 

you<00:02:23.520> start<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.480> part<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.230> easier

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.380 

and<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.720> small<00:02:32.390> corner

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and then you just have that small corner

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
and then you just have that small corner
part<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.080> pull<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:35.360> you're<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:37.400> inserting

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
part to pull in you're just inserting

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.900 
part to pull in you're just inserting
that<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> Lackey<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.860> origami<00:02:41.370> by

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that this is a Lackey with origami by

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.449 
that this is a Lackey with origami by
Aki<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.600> that's<00:02:43.350> how<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.560> make<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.980> origami

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
Aki and that's how you make the origami

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.209 
Aki and that's how you make the origami
bricks
