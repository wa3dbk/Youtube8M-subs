00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.469
 At the moment you can only beg 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.460
 the program can you play through and 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.160
 cottage 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.910
 which hairstyle as well 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.520
 killer instinct is mine that has me 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.230
 honestly never understood why 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.849
 april and sing to departures are missing 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.599
 I just have the killer instinct yes 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.279
 so today had to go on the lpga 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:36.110
 I am happy winner 2010 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:38.030
 still 20 or even unaware 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.250
 that it is also harris of the times we made 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 but that was great then tight 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.840
 play if I remember right there 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.230
 looks very much like ns 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.160
 more 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.160
 though something like that 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.970
 For example, a few battles against 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.329
 other 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.900
 but what was that now and 4 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.490
 well, ok 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.790
 I just threw it off 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.790
 3 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.710
 hmm 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.940
 I like the simple as the feet then so 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.940
 grow up and arms 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.630
 has the environment for big feet is me 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.130
 already noticed 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 the environment graphic taken away 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.210
 you spit blood 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 but in all honesty so I kind 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.700
 play cool thread in the past 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.310
 I can not give it to me much longer 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.720
 ten minutes good 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.280
 but luckily in the collection too 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.909
 a few others 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.830
 but much more profound games 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.430
 try another 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.440
 the bet is a bit of a gamble 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.440
 new imagine what it looks like 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.510
 hattemer breifriss queen 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.390
 banjo kazooie 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.390
 the market plays the banjo kazooie game 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 he plays it alone now 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.420
 because you can not feel it together 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.190
 I honestly understand how I do that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.930
 control is not quite the next start 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.930
 and select is not on the button 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 or markus has no idea about 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.540
 video games why does he moderate 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.270
 he actually did not do lpg 8 at all 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 but I but only as true but 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.790
 really what did not matter with the stream 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.760
 I do not know anything 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.740
 no i attack my break break 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.290
 is lunch break 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.940
 but already now 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.260
 markus has no idea about it 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.409
 is also Fabian Siegism and the moderator 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.170
 with so much more idea about apple 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:03.280
 with countryplay has battlefield 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.290
 ok now everything completely berka kids out 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.970
 hello , so I'm fine 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 tested right now but I have 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.600
 at least checked how come into play 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.370
 I must say the menu is a 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.220
 At least the least of them are denied 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.160
 collection but markus and the game 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.160
 that is already hard but without kicking 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.200
 because the lynx sounds great nintendo 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.550
 expert with whom you play but 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.720
 I pass it on smoothly that was yes 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.850
 first surprise has not 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.989
 counting backpack left gives here 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.450
 If you take the microphone I want now 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.360
 finally go home always unbelievable 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.890
 growth countries 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 people asylum and you must necessarily me 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.890
 show how it's done because I always had 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.390
 just a quick look at the buddy 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.240
 So once the battery of the ipad everything clear 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.130
 banjo kazooie so one of the best 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.130
 games that ever made where he does 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.360
 especially a crown of jump n runs 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.240
 we are unbelievable now 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 especially in the opera 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.830
 The first to start this is the b 1 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.660
 too, but I must say I think it's 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.560
 You can watch yourself , of course 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.110
 kind of the somehow now 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.360
 textures so polished up on hd and such 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.980
 but otherwise 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.080
 it would be quite original but me 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.340
 think it's still pretty that way you can 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.380
 you can still be open 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.989
 definitely very pretty so have 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.660
 a timeless classic what you do not 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.130
 from many 3d play can say for 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.480
 not quite a lot from the earth can 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.220
 You can not do it these days 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.140
 make an old tomb raider like that 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.480
 for example, or as often already 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.640
 played through the game childhood game 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.050
 so very open I even had mine 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.030
 teacher then help 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.320
 she had the game on and came on 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.210
 just do not finish and me 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.860
 had a narrative cafÃ© long since quiet 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.479
 a few problems because they are not 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.100
 more free now that shows me 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.380
 could explain why the game is so 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.300
 go through quickly 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.490
 then came the suspicion that I was for 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.530
 the school nothing doing and you gamble 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.830
 because actually there is no problem there 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.900
 good grades then or so at least 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.150
 meat starlets so a bonus comes 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.740
 one clearly matures from unfortunately 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.310
 4 pm in funny games 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.310
 and him 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.680
 of the idiot 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.230
 and zack 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.260
 peter solved 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.409
 that went fast 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.050
 you know what the story is here 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.909
 no idea phenomenal 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.550
 classic as before as ever with ever 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.680
 The mountain is very deep here 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.910
 sister was kidnapped by one 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.820
 ugly old witch 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.160
 which wants to preserve its beauty 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.160
 or again in general 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.960
 That 's why there's 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.300
 you learn here so here the eskimo 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.259
 lady 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.259
 you can see the course here 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.050
 so that's a bit conceited axia 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.870
 his did not quite work with 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.100
 beauty so far not yet 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.710
 and funny one also gets through here 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.990
 Her world is running, so to speak 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.370
 always comes home again claims as 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.130
 otherwise getting ready and so bold 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.390
 Domination never speaks in rhyming 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.000
 all the time 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.160
 wittmann drove quite a charm of his own 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.410
 still so the developers but dared 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.500
 thus have an offensive jokes the only 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.849
 adults understand 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.349
 Sounds funny to me 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.430
 if you do, but I believe here 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.360
 I have to have a few more now 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.680
 do things purely 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.719
 that's why it's still playing a bit 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.719
 continue to push merkel 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.020
 8th
