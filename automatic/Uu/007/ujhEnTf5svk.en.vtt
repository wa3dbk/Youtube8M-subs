 it was good all 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.529

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.220
 sopo

 it's the biggest 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.329
 way of creating one's own self-creating counts 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.310

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.130
 claude coulombe read another with like textures like this 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.050
 the meeting how these greenhouses is very very short very simple facelift 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 you'll see it's a lot brighter 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.310

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.120
 this is a day 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 so we will learn for example 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 it's here 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.260
 Marc Savard knew that all lenders luck 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260

 for example it changes everything 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.990
 for example 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 metz 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 after you have materials right away percent 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.210
 something like that 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.190
 So here is 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.509
 for example 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.889
