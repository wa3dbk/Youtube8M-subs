does the Sharpshooter giving us one

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
does the Sharpshooter giving us one
hundred<00:01:49.860> percent<00:01:50.210> obviously<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.689> let's<00:01:51.840> go

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
hundred percent obviously so let's go

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
hundred percent obviously so let's go
ahead<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.110> switch<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.460> tactical

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
ahead and switch that down to tactical

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
ahead and switch that down to tactical
advantage<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:54.750> i'll<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> okay<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
advantage now i'll go back to it okay so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.959 
advantage now i'll go back to it okay so
it<00:01:56.430> does<00:01:56.579> give<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.350> plus<00:01:58.610> 4900<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.729> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it does give you that plus 4900 now and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.410 
it does give you that plus 4900 now and
that<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that is because it is going to the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.899 
that is because it is going to the
percent<00:02:03.840> does<00:02:04.229> depend<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.829> crit<00:02:05.189> hit

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
percent does depend on your crit hit

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.340 
percent does depend on your crit hit
damage<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.390> well<00:02:06.570> as<00:02:06.719> your<00:02:06.840> quick<00:02:07.020> percent

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
damage as well as your quick percent

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
damage as well as your quick percent
chance<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.879> give<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.030> more

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
chance so that is going to give me more

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.430 
chance so that is going to give me more
