00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello and welcome to all on the ipad 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.879
 today we are here for you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.919
 present an accessory in this case 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.710
 the uss of our dreams 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.130
 this is a red for transformed into 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.340
 bad 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.789
 infiniti has that to the tss in the tablet 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 full hd 2 asus it's a red leather 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.990
 brown as can be seen with a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 used effect with loans cuts for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 have access to essential functions 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.369
 like the different ports and have 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.390
 permanent access to the keyboard dock on 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.940
 we will come back a little bit more 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 late we will start with the box no 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.390
 viable and in normal Christmas colors 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.879
 with the little church of saint tropez 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 which reminds of the location of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 the company and the gilded logo you like 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 as usual black colors and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.690
 reds whose klaus will be provided in a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.739
 small pocket so not necessarily useful 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.079
 but still practical because we 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.539
 will be able to reuse this pouch for 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.449
 other thing and so we 'll come she aa 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.260
 pushes so that lets appear as 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.850
 you were the main functions 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 so first of all she lets appear 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.559
 the battery on the side logically 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 it reveals the functions 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 main so the priority port 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.350
 to charge the jack the port 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 micro hdmi the micro the micro port sd 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.869
 the power button and the volume knob 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 and finally on the side the sd crowd port and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.860
 the micro usb port 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 so it's a cover that snaps to the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
 tablet that does that when we get it out 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 as you see we have a small effect 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 engraving and inside with the name of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.900
 dream the back of the tablet actually stays 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.049
 tenuous 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.189
 whatever happens and in fact it's 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.770
 gervais since a speaker is 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.000
 difficult here we see that the purpose of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.500
 this his kits and protected in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.780
 permanently the keyboard dock indeed 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.810
 as you see it will remain attached 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.130
 at the keyboard dock so the little flaw that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.710
 I have less is as we can see 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 the cut at the level of death you know 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.409
 a little offbeat but it's not 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.860
 all embarrassing it's about 24 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.920
 projects use 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.420
 in the end the comfort remains whole so we 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.660
 see that we always have access to keyboards 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.850
 at the port so it's a wheel which 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.369
 really allows you to actually wander 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.479
 with his tablet where we want 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.970
 for students professionals 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.770
 just have to squeeze at just 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.090
 the user to choose if he wants a 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.550
 redhead who are constantly on his 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.100
 on his tablet or a little cover 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.630
 more classic jimpo netbook that is 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.709
 for example once here we go out the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.840
 Tablet 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.780
 the table is totally empty so 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.850
 here you will be able to read the sudden is 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.170
 on the site with our opinion a little bit more 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.170
 pronounced good day
