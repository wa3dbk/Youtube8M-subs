00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.530
 the found in the kitchen of we are women 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 together we prepare a typical dish of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.710
 south italy 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.900
 we always use ciambotta 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.590
 preferably vegetables of 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.480
 season 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 so we at the market today have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.850
 found some fresh aubergines 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.879
 zucchini of peppers and complete with 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.449
 potatoes carrots and onions from tropea those 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.800
 red we finish the dish with water 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.780
 and extra virgin olive oil from breadcrumbs 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 and some pecorino will serve us on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.970
 surface for gratinating the dish e 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.970
 we perfume with basil 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.260
 I washed the vegetables or cut them into 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 fairly regular way I with a 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.210
 knife but if you want you can 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 help you with a mandolin and I dispose of them 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 in the pan on the bottom we put those 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.960
 harder carrots, potatoes first 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.520
 carrot layer and salt rho salt each 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.520
 vegetable layer 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.210
 potatoes salt on the potatoes I put the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.039
 onion then aubergines and peppers e 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.189
 last and the zucchini that are the most 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.189
 to keep 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.590
 let's put some basil leaves for 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.879
 perfume the dish strictly 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.879
 broken with hands 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.159
 we see the pepper with the potato peeler 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.159
 because it is more digestible 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.430
 we send the pepper from the seeds this 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.430
 name a we cut it into slices 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.040
 apple tree we have in the pan 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.170
 take the zucchini a little on the bias 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.830
 so come more graceful slices 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.830
 longer 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.610
 last layer of zucchini complete the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 plate with a mixture of oil and water 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.370
 in the proportion of a glass of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.189
 water and half a glass of oil 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.310
 obviously this this amount will be 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.790
 according to the container you will have 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.409
 used a suggestion 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.440
 choose a container that can go 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:37.019
 on the stove and in the oven because cooking 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.230
 so it will be twenty minutes on the fire and then 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.230
 I will tell you 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.460
 we cooked for 20 minutes 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.440
 vegetables on the fire 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.570
 now we pass them in the oven after having them 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.570
 sprinkled with breadcrumbs 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:11.510
 and pecorino finish the baking in the oven 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.070
 for 20 minutes and five minutes of grill 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.070
 so that a crust forms 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.090
 I forgot at 200 degrees
