00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.610
 then, before starting, I warn you that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.139
 this tutorial only for purpose 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.730
 informative so I'm not 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 responsible for what you do 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 so if something should happen to you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.000
 know that I am not responsible 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 then let's start by opening ours 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 internet browser god on google chrome 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.420
 and we need to open a mediafire link 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.519
 you will find the link in the description 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 of this video then to the motte in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.579
 this is not even media power here 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.640
 will bring a download page into 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.129
 minecraft the game best only 679 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 kilobytes and click on download 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.500
 now the download between started here is one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 once the game is finished downloading 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 let's drag on our text or that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 now we can close ours 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 browser is in this game does not need 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.239
 installation so once 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.579
 invade downloaded a can directly 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 drink it to think then the first 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.900
 once we click we open the game and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 you will see that there will be this 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.680
 this window and we need to click on 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 run though if you want this one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.380
 left does not appear every time you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.090
 have game 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 remove the check on the vis always 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.050
 before opening this file and click 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 on execute so it goes to the end if you don't 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.040
 in short, this is what I saw 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.570
 now an error has appeared and then 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 simply click on ok 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.730
 reopen the game can happen every 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.260
 so much when the game is scarce 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.720
 when davis did not appear to me now 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.400
 so now the launcher of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.630
 minecraft is here we have to enter the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.910
 our new user we want with 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 playing is only for the first time 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.970

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.470
 necessary to play minecraft 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.470
 so now let's leave charity 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.350

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.530
 lower left 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 if the game happens to be in 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.769
 another language and then when I have it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.569

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.319

 possibility of playing in single and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.239
 multiplayer to play multiplayer 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.890
 you need to add as many servers as you can 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.630
 find on the internet 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.400
 ok now let's go to the single player 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.470
 and I will show you precisely as a sanction 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.170
 the game then click on create a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.519
 new world and here we put creative and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.650
 we click again on the flower a new one 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.019
 world now all I show you that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.769
 the game really works is that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.769
 in fact it is not a fake 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.810
 ok now everything has finished loading 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.430
 the game so as you see precisely is the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.769
 whimsical game 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.690
 so if you want to see that from me in 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.040
 this video in which the holland is why 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.650
 meanwhile i'm playing i'm 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 but recording with cantafia from me the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.489
 game all the flat is always chance 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.859
 you see the game's going 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.890
 here slow on your computer come out of 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.019
 give a program called game booster 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.430
 tight then look on google e 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.380
 also installed this will have to that 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.540
 it only works on windows and should 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.670
 speed up your computer when 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.930
 you are playing with a game then 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.730
 exactly how you saw the game 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.829
 it works perfectly 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.170
 and it is precisely that which is in fact authentic 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.170
 the latest version that came out so far 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.790
 ok once we're done with 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.530
 turn we can simply click 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.730
 on bait then we go on the save around 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.939
 to the main menu 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.890
 ok as you saw the game is 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.269
 the real one therefore not there 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.549
 they will be viruses so you don't have to 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.620
 to worry about this I tell you why 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.420
 sending in other videos is similar to 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.609

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.500
 comments asked if he would bring 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.780
