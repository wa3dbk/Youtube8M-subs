and squeezing at the top and then

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.070 
and squeezing at the top and then
following<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.560> super<00:01:13.890> sets<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.430> did

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
following the super sets we did

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
following the super sets we did
occlusion<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.560> basically<00:01:17.280> wrapped<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
occlusion so we basically wrapped the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
occlusion so we basically wrapped the
strap<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.720> top<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> our<00:01:19.140> arm<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.979> keep

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
strap around the top of our arm to keep

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.450 
strap around the top of our arm to keep
the<00:01:20.430> blood<00:01:20.640> inside<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> muscle<00:01:22.220> see<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the blood inside the muscle see at the

the blood inside the muscle see at the
top<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> arm<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.390> basically<00:01:25.110> focusing<00:01:25.740> on

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
top of the arm and basically focusing on

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910 
top of the arm and basically focusing on
high<00:01:26.220> repetitions<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.890> really

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
high repetitions to really to really

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
high repetitions to really to really
just<00:01:29.430> pump<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.960> muscle<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.409> fatigue

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
just pump out the the muscle and fatigue

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.789 
just pump out the the muscle and fatigue
the<00:01:31.799> muscle<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> try<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the muscle and as you try it it's it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.080 
the muscle and as you try it it's it
burns<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.430> badly

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

it's<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.750> intense<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:38.030> as<00:01:39.030> seen<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.600> I've

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's very intense but as seen as I've

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
it's very intense but as seen as I've
seen<00:01:39.990> training<00:01:40.350> through<00:01:40.860> John's<00:01:41.159> methods

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
seen training through John's methods

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.450 
seen training through John's methods
I've<00:01:42.960> seen<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.409> growth<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> those<00:01:44.130> weak

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I've seen a lot of growth in those weak

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.600 
I've seen a lot of growth in those weak
areas<00:01:44.850> such<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.360> triceps<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:47.159> after<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
areas such as my triceps so after that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.350 
areas such as my triceps so after that
we<00:01:47.759> went<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> biceps<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.619> started<00:01:50.040> with

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
we went to biceps and we started with

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
we went to biceps and we started with
dumbbell<00:01:51.360> curls<00:01:51.890> see<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> dumbbell<00:01:53.280> curls

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
dumbbell curls see the dumbbell curls

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.780 
dumbbell curls see the dumbbell curls
super<00:01:54.329> setting<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.250> standing<00:01:56.250> hammer<00:01:56.460> curls

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
super setting to standing hammer curls

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.539 
super setting to standing hammer curls
and<00:01:57.170> what<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.530> hammer<00:01:58.799> curls<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.310> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
and what I like about hammer curls is it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.850 
and what I like about hammer curls is it
not<00:01:59.969> only<00:02:00.090> hits<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> bicep<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> outer<00:02:01.259> part

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
not only hits the bicep the outer part

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
not only hits the bicep the outer part
of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> bicep<00:02:02.340> head<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.600> hits<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
of the bicep head but it also hits the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.560 
of the bicep head but it also hits the
forearms<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.250> focus<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:05.939> squeezing<00:02:06.299> at<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
forearms so I focus on squeezing at the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
forearms so I focus on squeezing at the
top<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.200> exercise<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.610> lowering<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.030> weight

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
top the exercise and lowering the weight

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.469 
top the exercise and lowering the weight
down

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
down

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.540 
down
I<00:02:10.509> tend<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.200> get<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.350> good<00:02:11.560> pump<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:11.890> my<00:02:12.010> arms<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
I tend to get a good pump in my arms and
