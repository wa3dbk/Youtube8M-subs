00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
what's one of the reasons why you would

what's one of the reasons why you would

display of the z4 music it's most likely

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.520

you<00:03:43.709> can<00:03:43.739> use<00:03:44.099> this<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.519> listen<00:03:44.909> to<00:03:45.090> music<00:03:45.299> at<00:03:45.659> a

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
higher quality you're not gonna use this

z4<00:03:51.989> now<00:03:52.680> another<00:03:53.370> reason<00:03:53.609> is<00:03:53.879> probably<00:03:54.239> most

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
z4 now another reason is probably most

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.539 
z4 now another reason is probably most
likely<00:03:54.659> to<00:03:54.900> keep<00:03:55.199> the<00:03:55.470> price<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.310> phone

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
likely to keep the price of this phone

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.179 
likely to keep the price of this phone
down<00:03:56.879> if<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.659> watch<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.290> es<00:03:58.650> then<00:03:58.949> you<00:03:59.040> know

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
down if you watch the es then you know

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.729 
down if you watch the es then you know
that<00:03:59.340> Sony<00:03:59.639> released<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.389> Sony<00:04:00.989> Walkman

that Sony released the Sony Walkman

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.399 
that Sony released the Sony Walkman
priced<00:04:02.370> at<00:04:02.579> $1,200<00:04:03.510> which<00:04:03.810> does<00:04:04.109> almost

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
priced at $1,200 which does almost

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.500 
priced at $1,200 which does almost
exactly<00:04:04.979> the<00:04:05.159> same<00:04:05.370> thing<00:04:05.639> just<00:04:05.970> has<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> few

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
exactly the same thing just has a few

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.899 
exactly the same thing just has a few
more<00:04:06.750> features<00:04:07.049> they<00:04:07.979> most<00:04:08.189> likely<00:04:08.370> wanted<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
more features they most likely wanted to

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.179 
more features they most likely wanted to
do<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.299> in<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.720> phone<00:04:09.959> version<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:10.859> keep<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
do that in a phone version but keep the

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.860 
do that in a phone version but keep the
price<00:04:11.400> point<00:04:11.669> down<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.269> people<00:04:12.720> would

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
price point down so that people would

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.659 
price point down so that people would
actually<00:04:13.049> buy<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.919> that's<00:04:14.159> most<00:04:14.430> likely

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
actually buy it and that's most likely

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.370 
actually buy it and that's most likely
the<00:04:14.909> reason<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.659> that's<00:04:15.810> pretty<00:04:15.959> much<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.199> for

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
the reason so that's pretty much it for

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.439 
the reason so that's pretty much it for
the<00:04:16.680> room<00:04:16.829> expect<00:04:17.250> some<00:04:17.400> features<00:04:17.820> not<00:04:18.030> onto

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
the room expect some features not onto

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.599 
the room expect some features not onto
the<00:04:18.539> release<00:04:18.840> date<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.259> price<00:04:19.560> point<00:04:19.889> as<00:04:20.220> right

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the release date in price point as right

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.760 
the release date in price point as right
now<00:04:20.639> everything<00:04:21.389> is<00:04:21.450> just<00:04:21.570> pointing<00:04:22.229> towards

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
now everything is just pointing towards

once<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.150> happens<00:04:39.600> just<00:04:39.690> make<00:04:39.930> sure<00:04:40.050> you

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
once that happens just make sure you

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.730 
once that happens just make sure you
watch<00:04:40.350> it

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
watch it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.840 
watch it
that's<00:04:41.040> where<00:04:41.220> everything<00:04:41.400> will<00:04:41.640> be

announced that's for a price point most

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.440 
announced that's for a price point most
likely<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.550> just<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.820> be<00:04:44.850> priced<00:04:45.240> exactly

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
likely it's just to be priced exactly

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.370 
likely it's just to be priced exactly
where<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.470> z3<00:04:46.890> was<00:04:47.280> priced<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.730> 650<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.900> 750
