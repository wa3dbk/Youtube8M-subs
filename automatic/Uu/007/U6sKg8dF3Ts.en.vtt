00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hey this is why we are with BMG drive

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.039 
hey this is why we are with BMG drive
and<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.629> going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.810> look<00:00:03.870> at<00:00:04.020> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
and today we're going to look at a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.809 
and today we're going to look at a
pretty<00:00:04.350> simple<00:00:04.830> map<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.190> fact<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:05.549> even<00:00:05.609> has

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
pretty simple map in fact it even has

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.130 
pretty simple map in fact it even has
the<00:00:05.910> word<00:00:06.029> simple<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.540> its<00:00:06.690> name<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:07.080> called

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the word simple in its name it's called

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.700 
the word simple in its name it's called
simple<00:00:07.710> obstacle<00:00:08.429> course<00:00:08.929> but<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.559> won't

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
simple obstacle course but you won't

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.959 
simple obstacle course but you won't
find<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> menus<00:00:11.370> because<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.790> replaces

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
find in the menus because it replaces

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.600 
find in the menus because it replaces
grid<00:00:12.570> pure<00:00:13.019> small<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:14.130> if<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.309> install<00:00:14.519> this

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
grid pure small so if you install this

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.220 
grid pure small so if you install this
map<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.880> want<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> back<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.360> otherwise

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
map you want to back that up otherwise

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.390 
map you want to back that up otherwise
you'll<00:00:16.500> lose<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.800> then<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
you'll lose it then you have to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.590 
you'll lose it then you have to
redownload<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.850> game<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.150> something<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> get

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
redownload the game or something to get

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.859 
redownload the game or something to get
it

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.410 
it
so<00:00:19.560> back<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:20.039> before<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.119> install<00:00:21.330> this

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so back that up before you install this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.939 
so back that up before you install this
map<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> simple<00:00:22.320> obstacle<00:00:22.560> course

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
map so this is simple obstacle course

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.830 
map so this is simple obstacle course
and<00:00:23.220> yeah<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> pretty<00:00:24.420> simple<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.810> don't

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
and yeah it is pretty simple I don't

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.790 
and yeah it is pretty simple I don't
know<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.109> there's<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.439> more<00:00:25.590> stuff

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
know if there's going to be more stuff

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
know if there's going to be more stuff
added<00:00:25.980> eventually<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> see<00:00:27.750> now<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
added eventually but what you see now is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.490 
added eventually but what you see now is
considered<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> release<00:00:28.890> state<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.720> can

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
considered a release state so you can

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.749 
considered a release state so you can
assume<00:00:31.800> maybe<00:00:32.070> they'll<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.399> more<00:00:32.430> maybe

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
assume maybe they'll be more maybe

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
assume maybe they'll be more maybe
they'll<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.030> not<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.710> here's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
they'll be not I don't know but here's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.709 
they'll be not I don't know but here's
what<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.399> far<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> block

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
what there is so far you have a block

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.389 
what there is so far you have a block
here<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.410> drive<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> over<00:00:38.219> Oh

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
here which you can drive up and over Oh

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.410 
here which you can drive up and over Oh
or<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.420> whoops<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> again<00:00:41.180> Fresh<00:00:42.180> Start

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
or not whoops try that again Fresh Start

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
or not whoops try that again Fresh Start
because<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:43.920> feel

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because I don't know I just don't feel

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
because I don't know I just don't feel
right<00:00:44.280> something<00:00:44.730> didn't<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.350> anyways

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
right something didn't go good anyways

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.959 
right something didn't go good anyways
you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.890> without<00:00:47.700> too<00:00:47.879> much

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you can go up in without too much

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.209 
you can go up in without too much
difficulty<00:00:48.360> they're<00:00:49.079> kind<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> too<00:00:49.800> thin<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
difficulty they're kind of too thin to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.410 
difficulty they're kind of too thin to
try<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.730> both<00:00:50.879> sides<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
try to do it with both sides you do it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
try to do it with both sides you do it
one<00:00:51.570> tire<00:00:51.809> only<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.590> same<00:00:55.590> ideas<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
one tire only so same ideas just kind of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.810 
one tire only so same ideas just kind of
not<00:00:57.149> actually<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.840> easy<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.680> mean<00:00:59.520> there

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
not actually that easy and I mean there

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
not actually that easy and I mean there
we<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.449> climb<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
we go that's kind of like climb the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
we go that's kind of like climb the
sidewalk<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> sidewalk<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
sidewalk right if the sidewalk was a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
sidewalk right if the sidewalk was a
foot<00:01:02.820> high<00:01:03.199> yeah<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.710> way<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> test<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
foot high yeah a good way to test the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.560 
foot high yeah a good way to test the
suspension<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> car<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.420> see

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
suspension of the car like you can see

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.350 
suspension of the car like you can see
the<00:01:06.780> UH<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:08.040> back<00:01:08.250> wheels<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.150> ran

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the UH the back wheels actually they ran

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
the UH the back wheels actually they ran
out<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> travel<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> floating<00:01:10.799> tire

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
out of travel so there's a floating tire

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.969 
out of travel so there's a floating tire
in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.439> interesting<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
in the back so that's interesting the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
in the back so that's interesting the
next<00:01:14.010> one's<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> too<00:01:15.119> tall<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.570> in

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
next one's kind of too tall to do in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
next one's kind of too tall to do in
this<00:01:15.810> truck<00:01:16.020> actually<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.670> because<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this truck actually it's a because the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.160 
this truck actually it's a because the
fender<00:01:18.030> hits<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> fender<00:01:18.720> hits<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fender hits and at the fender hits and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.539 
fender hits and at the fender hits and
it<00:01:19.259> makes<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.710> difficult<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.220> clear<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it makes it really difficult to clear it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.270 
it makes it really difficult to clear it
because<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.090> any<00:01:21.270> sort<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
because you don't have any sort of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.430 
because you don't have any sort of
traction<00:01:22.850> your<00:01:23.210> tires<00:01:23.450> kind<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.750> just<00:01:23.900> yeah

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
traction your tires kind of just yeah

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.600 
traction your tires kind of just yeah
you<00:01:24.500> see<00:01:24.860> what<00:01:24.950> they're<00:01:25.070> doing<00:01:25.100> that's<00:01:25.460> not

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
you see what they're doing that's not

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.060 
you see what they're doing that's not
good<00:01:26.230> it's<00:01:27.230> not<00:01:27.350> good<00:01:27.410> when<00:01:27.590> your<00:01:27.740> tires<00:01:27.890> do

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
good it's not good when your tires do

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.860 
good it's not good when your tires do
that<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.760> fact<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.090> don't<00:01:29.180> think<00:01:29.270> they<00:01:29.450> should<00:01:29.690> I

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
that in fact I don't think they should I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.210 
that in fact I don't think they should I
think<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.110> sickle<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.590> kind<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.040> I'm<00:01:31.100> not

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
think that sickle is kind of but I'm not

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.160 
think that sickle is kind of but I'm not
positive<00:01:31.430> they<00:01:32.420> got<00:01:32.570> some<00:01:32.690> pumps<00:01:32.930> right<00:01:33.020> here

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
positive they got some pumps right here

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
positive they got some pumps right here
you<00:01:33.230> could<00:01:33.350> have<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.500> monster<00:01:34.100> bumps<00:01:34.220> lumps<00:01:34.460> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
you could have a monster bumps lumps and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.550 
you could have a monster bumps lumps and
they<00:01:35.180> say<00:01:35.300> on<00:01:35.510> texture<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.230> knoteks

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
they say on texture and knoteks

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.690 
they say on texture and knoteks
depending<00:01:36.920> on<00:01:36.980> which<00:01:37.070> angle<00:01:37.220> you're<00:01:37.460> coming

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
depending on which angle you're coming

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.930 
depending on which angle you're coming
from<00:01:38.080> might<00:01:39.080> need<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.260> be<00:01:39.350> fixed<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.760> got

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
from might need to be fixed and you got

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.730 
from might need to be fixed and you got
this<00:01:41.150> thing<00:01:41.210> which<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:42.110> don't<00:01:42.170> really<00:01:42.560> know

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
this thing which I don't really know

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.500 
this thing which I don't really know
what<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.950> does<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.550> could<00:01:43.700> bump<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.390> it

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
what it does but you could bump it to it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.360 
what it does but you could bump it to it
and<00:01:44.630> go<00:01:44.750> over<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.680> got<00:01:45.830> another<00:01:46.010> bump<00:01:46.160> here

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
and go over it you got another bump here

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.940 
and go over it you got another bump here
and<00:01:47.230> you<00:01:48.230> go<00:01:48.380> oh<00:01:48.970> wow

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
and you go oh wow

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
able to do a wheel stand like this I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.180 
able to do a wheel stand like this I
can't<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:17.840> oh<00:02:17.870> well<00:02:18.170> anyways<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.100> got

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
can't do it now oh well anyways you got

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.590 
can't do it now oh well anyways you got
the<00:02:19.400> wheel<00:02:19.550> stand<00:02:19.880> area<00:02:20.209> that's<00:02:20.390> I'm<00:02:20.480> gonna

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
the wheel stand area that's I'm gonna

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.570 
the wheel stand area that's I'm gonna
call<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.810> now<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.010> got<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> basic

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
call that now and then you got the basic

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.860 
call that now and then you got the basic
bumps<00:02:22.820> which<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.030> see<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.240> every<00:02:23.480> map<00:02:23.630> pretty

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
bumps which you see on every map pretty

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.050 
bumps which you see on every map pretty
much<00:02:24.070> then<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.160> got<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.400> thing<00:02:25.640> which<00:02:25.850> is

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
much then you got this thing which is

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.410 
much then you got this thing which is
harder<00:02:26.870> than<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.019> looks<00:02:27.140> unfortunately<00:02:28.420> and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
harder than it looks unfortunately and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.670 
harder than it looks unfortunately and
see<00:02:29.600> unfortunately<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.170> was<00:02:30.260> kind<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.500> hard

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
see unfortunately it was kind of hard

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.009 
see unfortunately it was kind of hard
for<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.860> wrong<00:02:31.040> reasons<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.519> seems<00:02:31.730> like

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
for the wrong reasons it seems like

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.270 
for the wrong reasons it seems like
we'll<00:02:33.019> see<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.320> experience<00:02:33.800> problems<00:02:34.100> or<00:02:34.220> if

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
we'll see if I experience problems or if

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.180 
we'll see if I experience problems or if
I<00:02:34.370> am<00:02:34.790> able<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:36.620> having<00:02:36.980> some

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
I am able to do it I'm having some

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.880 
I am able to do it I'm having some
trouble<00:02:37.220> earlier<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.150> we'll<00:02:38.330> see<00:02:38.830> try<00:02:39.830> to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
trouble earlier so we'll see try to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.809 
trouble earlier so we'll see try to
bring<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.160> up<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.340> about<00:02:40.370> 60<00:02:41.030> hopefully

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.940 

here<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:46.480> almost<00:02:47.480> see<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.079> problem<00:02:48.499> is<00:02:48.650> I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
here and almost see the problem is I

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.550 
here and almost see the problem is I
have<00:02:49.219> is<00:02:49.879> it<00:02:50.060> seems<00:02:50.239> like<00:02:50.389> the<00:02:50.569> start<00:02:50.959> food<00:02:51.319> I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
have is it seems like the start food I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.179 
have is it seems like the start food I
got<00:02:51.739> right<00:02:51.920> now

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
got right now

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.479 
got right now
the<00:02:52.639> start<00:02:52.939> is<00:02:53.060> kind<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.389> too<00:02:53.540> bumpy<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.769> get<00:02:55.459> a

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the start is kind of too bumpy to get a

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.729 
the start is kind of too bumpy to get a
clean<00:02:55.969> transition<00:02:56.749> from<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.170> road<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.530> ramp

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
clean transition from the road to ramp

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.679 
clean transition from the road to ramp
see<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.549> bouncing<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.239> then<00:02:59.389> you<00:02:59.540> don't

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
see in the bouncing and then you don't

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.089 
see in the bouncing and then you don't
have<00:02:59.749> enough<00:02:59.989> traction<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.799> of<00:03:00.859> stay<00:03:01.069> on

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
have enough traction to kind of stay on

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.569 
have enough traction to kind of stay on
it

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
it

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.629 
it
because<00:03:02.450> it's<00:03:02.599> curved<00:03:02.900> at<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.230> same<00:03:03.439> time<00:03:03.709> so

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
because it's curved at the same time so

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.780 
because it's curved at the same time so
it<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.879> makes<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.180> kind<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.510> difficult<00:03:05.719> to<00:03:06.260> do

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
it just makes it kind of difficult to do

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.550 
it just makes it kind of difficult to do
could<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.000> watch<00:03:08.150> your<00:03:08.389> bounce<00:03:08.629> you<00:03:09.379> don't

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
could you watch your bounce you don't

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.229 
could you watch your bounce you don't
have<00:03:09.739> traction<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.370> by<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.549> time<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.849> do<00:03:11.030> your

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
have traction if by the time you do your

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.140 
have traction if by the time you do your
you<00:03:11.599> already<00:03:12.049> get<00:03:12.290> them<00:03:12.379> yeah<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:13.010> mean<00:03:13.999> if<00:03:14.090> you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
you already get them yeah I mean if you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.369 
you already get them yeah I mean if you
want<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.359> do<00:03:14.419> it<00:03:14.540> easy<00:03:14.780> what<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.049> do<00:03:15.139> is<00:03:15.200> just

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
want to do it easy what you do is just

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.229 
want to do it easy what you do is just
pull<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.680> e<00:03:16.250> ik<00:03:16.340> allows<00:03:16.609> a<00:03:16.639> ton<00:03:16.939> of<00:03:16.969> power

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
pull out of e ik allows a ton of power

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.729 
pull out of e ik allows a ton of power
and<00:03:17.510> then<00:03:17.599> you<00:03:17.659> could<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.019> power<00:03:18.290> through<00:03:18.409> it

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
and then you could just power through it

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.610 
and then you could just power through it
so<00:03:19.359> for<00:03:20.359> example<00:03:20.719> we<00:03:20.780> can<00:03:20.870> use<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.019> drag<00:03:21.319> truck

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
so for example we can use a drag truck

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.990 
so for example we can use a drag truck
and<00:03:21.859> we<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.250> power<00:03:22.489> through<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.879> because

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
and we can just power through it because

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.069 
and we can just power through it because
ok<00:03:23.389> whoa<00:03:25.269> but<00:03:26.269> we<00:03:26.359> could<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.569> power<00:03:26.780> through<00:03:26.989> it

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
ok whoa but we could to power through it

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.270 
ok whoa but we could to power through it
by<00:03:27.169> going<00:03:27.349> like<00:03:27.469> this<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:27.889> go<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.189> ramp

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
by going like this just go up the ramp

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.729 
by going like this just go up the ramp
slowly<00:03:28.609> and<00:03:28.819> then<00:03:28.939> hit<00:03:29.120> power<00:03:29.329> oh<00:03:29.889> my<00:03:30.889> what<00:03:32.739> I'm

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
slowly and then hit power oh my what I'm

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.869 
slowly and then hit power oh my what I'm
not<00:03:33.949> sure<00:03:34.069> what<00:03:34.219> just<00:03:34.370> happened<00:03:34.669> there<00:03:34.790> in

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
not sure what just happened there in

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.729 
not sure what just happened there in
hell<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.120> um<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:36.260> was<00:03:36.949> weird<00:03:38.199> but<00:03:39.199> anyways<00:03:39.620> I

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
hell is um I was weird but anyways I

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.020 
hell is um I was weird but anyways I
saying<00:03:40.010> those<00:03:40.159> you<00:03:40.310> could<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.609> go<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.909> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
saying those you could just go on it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.220 
saying those you could just go on it
carefully<00:03:41.449> and<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.599> need<00:03:41.719> to<00:03:41.780> probably<00:03:41.930> power

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
carefully and I need to probably power

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.309 
carefully and I need to probably power
through<00:03:42.530> it

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
through it

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.539 
through it
or<00:03:44.829> not<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.700> don't<00:03:45.819> know<00:03:46.299> yeah<00:03:47.189> I'm<00:03:48.189> sure<00:03:48.219> you

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
or not I don't know yeah I'm sure you

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.360 
or not I don't know yeah I'm sure you
could<00:03:48.849> do<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.349> seems<00:03:50.349> like<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.829> being<00:03:51.280> a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
could do it seems like it's a being a

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.649 
could do it seems like it's a being a
bit<00:03:51.519> of<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.700> struggle<00:03:51.969> though

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.550 

yeah<00:03:55.659> whatever<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.260> don't<00:03:56.920> know<00:03:58.379> that's<00:03:59.379> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
yeah whatever I don't know that's the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.809 
yeah whatever I don't know that's the
most<00:03:59.650> interesting<00:03:59.920> part<00:04:00.159> too<00:04:00.489> is<00:04:00.519> well<00:04:00.790> I

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
most interesting part too is well I

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.640 
most interesting part too is well I
guess<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:03.690> nether<00:04:04.690> while<00:04:05.170> having<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.620> a

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
guess the the nether while having to a

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.000 
guess the the nether while having to a
stand<00:04:07.200> whatever<00:04:08.200> on<00:04:08.470> my<00:04:08.590> front<00:04:08.769> tire<00:04:08.980> is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
stand whatever on my front tire is

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.160 
stand whatever on my front tire is
pretty<00:04:09.310> interesting<00:04:09.670> if<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:09.879> thing<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.239> kind

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
pretty interesting if this thing is kind

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.210 
pretty interesting if this thing is kind
of<00:04:11.230> difficult<00:04:11.409> I<00:04:11.650> don't<00:04:11.769> know<00:04:11.829> if<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.040> made

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
of difficult I don't know if it is made

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.009 
of difficult I don't know if it is made
for<00:04:12.459> this<00:04:12.640> map<00:04:12.849> or<00:04:13.090> from<00:04:13.569> a<00:04:13.629> different<00:04:13.750> map

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
for this map or from a different map

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.039 
for this map or from a different map
though<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:15.060> don't<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.209> actually<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.660> mean<00:04:16.780> just

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
collar solo you can stop watching now I

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.670 
collar solo you can stop watching now I
keep<00:04:25.840> trying<00:04:26.080> because<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.260> want<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.470> get<00:04:26.560> it

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
keep trying because I want to get it

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.550 
keep trying because I want to get it
done<00:04:26.860> just<00:04:27.390> because<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.540> want<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.960> finish<00:04:29.110> but

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
done just because I want to finish but

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.050 
done just because I want to finish but
that's<00:04:30.010> all<00:04:30.160> that's<00:04:30.280> gonna<00:04:30.400> be<00:04:30.520> left<00:04:30.640> probably

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
it'd be real easy just not make up is

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.030 
it'd be real easy just not make up is
going<00:04:38.770> too<00:04:38.920> fast

you're<00:05:27.320> left<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.710> your<00:05:27.860> right<00:05:28.040> you<00:05:28.220> stop<00:05:28.490> you

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
you're left is your right you stop you

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.670 
you're left is your right you stop you
turn<00:05:29.660> left<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.990> stay<00:05:30.140> on<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.290> road<00:05:30.410> there<00:05:30.560> then

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
turn left to stay on the road there then

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.070 
turn left to stay on the road there then
you<00:05:30.770> gotta<00:05:30.920> turn<00:05:31.040> right<00:05:31.310> for<00:05:31.490> that<00:05:31.610> part<00:05:32.080> so

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
you gotta turn right for that part so

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.200 
you gotta turn right for that part so
it's<00:05:33.560> way<00:05:33.950> it's<00:05:34.340> actually<00:05:34.490> much<00:05:34.820> harder<00:05:34.970> than

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
it's way it's actually much harder than

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.990 
it's way it's actually much harder than
it<00:05:35.300> looks

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
it looks

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.640 
it looks
see<00:05:38.000> left<00:05:38.210> left<00:05:38.510> left<00:05:38.600> right<00:05:38.930> right<00:05:39.050> right<00:05:39.260> and

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
see left left left right right right and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.490 
see left left left right right right and
then<00:05:40.130> you<00:05:41.090> got<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.270> cape<00:05:41.570> keep<00:05:41.900> on<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.140> powers

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
then you got a cape keep on the powers

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.850 
then you got a cape keep on the powers
Wow

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.490 

it's<00:05:45.860> way<00:05:46.100> harder<00:05:46.130> than<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.550> looks

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
it's way harder than it looks

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.140 
it's way harder than it looks
left<00:05:48.500> left<00:05:48.650> left<00:05:48.740> right<00:05:48.950> right<00:05:49.040> right<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:49.520> too

up like that I don't know if that's the
truck<00:06:07.380> of<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.590> ramp<00:06:07.830> it's<00:06:08.310> kind<00:06:08.550> of<00:06:08.610> weird<00:06:08.820> I

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
truck of the ramp it's kind of weird I

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.270 
truck of the ramp it's kind of weird I
don't<00:06:11.520> know<00:06:11.580> that's<00:06:12.540> uh<00:06:12.930> yeah<00:06:13.770> that's<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.130> map

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
don't know that's uh yeah that's the map

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.520 
don't know that's uh yeah that's the map
though<00:06:14.460> like<00:06:14.670> I<00:06:14.760> says<00:06:14.940> not<00:06:15.210> much<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:16.170> it<00:06:16.200> it's

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
though like I says not much to it it's

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.460 
though like I says not much to it it's
just<00:06:16.830> a<00:06:17.010> simple<00:06:17.550> small<00:06:18.060> area<00:06:18.410> hopefully<00:06:19.410> it

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
just a simple small area hopefully it

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.140 
just a simple small area hopefully it
gets<00:06:19.560> expanded<00:06:19.860> to<00:06:20.100> have<00:06:20.130> more<00:06:20.340> things<00:06:20.610> just

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
gets expanded to have more things just

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.180 
gets expanded to have more things just
because<00:06:21.360> it's<00:06:21.510> not<00:06:21.630> too<00:06:21.750> much<00:06:21.840> there<00:06:22.190> look

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
because it's not too much there look

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.180 
because it's not too much there look
another<00:06:23.430> map<00:06:23.610> you<00:06:23.730> can<00:06:23.880> see<00:06:23.910> things<00:06:24.270> a<00:06:24.980> to<00:06:25.980> see

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
another map you can see things a to see

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.850 
another map you can see things a to see
huh<00:06:26.820> look<00:06:27.150> at<00:06:27.210> goes<00:06:27.540> look<00:06:28.290> at<00:06:28.380> that<00:06:28.470> goes<00:06:28.680> crazy
