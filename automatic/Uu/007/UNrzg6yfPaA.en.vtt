all around the phone and I'll just go in

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.830 
all around the phone and I'll just go in
detail<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.010> at<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> top<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.940> leaves<00:00:48.210> access

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
detail so at the top it leaves access

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080 
detail so at the top it leaves access
for<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.530> headphone<00:00:49.890> jack<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.820> actually

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
for the headphone jack and it actually

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
for the headphone jack and it actually
provides<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.989> lot<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> room<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> headphone

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
provides a lot of room for the headphone

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.180 
provides a lot of room for the headphone
jack<00:00:53.219> other<00:00:54.030> cases<00:00:54.390> might<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.079> kind<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> trim

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
jack other cases might just kind of trim

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
jack other cases might just kind of trim
around<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> headphone<00:00:56.850> jack<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.870> allowing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
around the headphone jack not allowing

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.639 
around the headphone jack not allowing
you<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> plug<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.539> some<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:01.050> auxiliary

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you to plug in some like auxiliary

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
you to plug in some like auxiliary
cables<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.340> bigger<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.000> won't<00:01:03.210> fit<00:01:03.510> if

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cables are bigger and they won't fit if

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
cables are bigger and they won't fit if
you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.930> another<00:01:04.140> case<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.010> case<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
you have another case on so this case is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
you have another case on so this case is
really<00:01:05.939> good<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
really good for that and then the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
really good for that and then the
sleep/wake<00:01:08.040> button<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.670> easy<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> press<00:01:09.210> too

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
sleep/wake button it's easy to press too

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.640 
sleep/wake button it's easy to press too

so this whole area is exposed there's no

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
so this whole area is exposed there's no
buttons<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.250> side<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> phone<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.150> it's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270

sometimes<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.780> used<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
sometimes kind of have to get used to it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
sometimes kind of have to get used to it
but<00:01:44.189> other<00:01:44.430> than<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.939> provides<00:01:45.270> great

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
but other than that it provides great

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
but other than that it provides great
protection<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> volume<00:01:46.470> buttons<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
protection for the volume buttons and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
protection for the volume buttons and
then<00:01:47.579> there's<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> silence<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
then there's the silence which which is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.980 
then there's the silence which which is
easy<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> flip<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.579> protected<00:01:50.990> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
easy to flip and it's well protected so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
easy to flip and it's well protected so
then<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.860> last<00:01:53.009> part<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.610> a

then on the back the last part we have a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060 
then on the back the last part we have a
hole<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> camera<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:56.040> right

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
hole for the camera so you can see right

I'm<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.259> saying<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.430> related

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I'm just saying that not really related

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
I'm just saying that not really related
to<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.329> video<00:02:06.680> but<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.979> yeah<00:02:08.220> there's<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to this video but so yeah there's the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.119 
to this video but so yeah there's the
case<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.110> thin<00:02:10.410> case<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.860> lot

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
case it's a really thin case a lot

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.920 
case it's a really thin case a lot
thinner<00:02:11.370> than<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.760> bumper<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.660> feels

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
thinner than the bumper and it feels

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.640 
thinner than the bumper and it feels
almost<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
almost like the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.539 
almost like the
iphone<00:02:13.950> 4<00:02:14.250> has<00:02:14.430> no<00:02:14.700> case<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.390> terms<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.590> size

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
iphone 4 has no case in terms of size

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.690 
iphone 4 has no case in terms of size
but<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.360> terms<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.750> feel<00:02:19.049> it<00:02:19.230> has<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> nice<00:02:19.769> soft

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
but in terms of feel it has a nice soft

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.020 
but in terms of feel it has a nice soft
like<00:02:21.090> rubbery<00:02:21.680> silicone<00:02:22.680> back<00:02:22.980> that's<00:02:23.700> hard

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
like rubbery silicone back that's hard

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.990 
like rubbery silicone back that's hard
but<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.959> it'll<00:02:25.379> it's<00:02:25.890> easy<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.430> slip<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.879> and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
but so it'll it's easy to slip in and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.940 
but so it'll it's easy to slip in and
out<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.150> your<00:02:27.269> pocket<00:02:27.689> but<00:02:28.319> also<00:02:28.530> has<00:02:28.799> that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
out of your pocket but also has that

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.869 
out of your pocket but also has that
soft<00:02:29.250> nice<00:02:29.939> finish<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.870> back<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:32.040> overall

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
soft nice finish on the back so overall

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.229 
soft nice finish on the back so overall
the<00:02:33.000> case<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.329> great<00:02:33.689> but<00:02:34.079> it's<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:36.030> not

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
