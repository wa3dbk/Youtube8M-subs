00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.840 
for cleaning priming storage it's a
great<00:02:06.030> unit

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.820 

very<00:02:11.850> easy<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.330> use<00:02:12.570> they<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.930> make<00:02:13.260> an<00:02:13.380> x5

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
very easy to use they do make an x5

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.570 
very easy to use they do make an x5
which<00:02:14.640> would<00:02:15.570> do<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.170> well<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.400> can

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
which would do just as well but it can

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.440 
which would do just as well but it can
only<00:02:17.700> use<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> point<00:02:18.990> zero<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:19.680> five<00:02:19.860> tip<00:02:20.450> where

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
only use a point zero one five tip where

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.510 
only use a point zero one five tip where
the<00:02:21.570> x7<00:02:22.020> can<00:02:22.230> go<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> eight<00:02:22.800> point<00:02:23.070> zero<00:02:23.370> one

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the x7 can go up to eight point zero one
