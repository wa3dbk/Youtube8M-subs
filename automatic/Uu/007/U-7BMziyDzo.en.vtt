00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.389
 see please give me weapons now 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 I'll show you the wrong production 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:21.210
 shot from svd and correct 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.750
 production and what is the result 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 this will pay attention here I am 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 survived the free run and then sharply pressed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.670
 on the trigger 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.360
 you saw the oscillations of the weapon which 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.870
 sank quite down sharply and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.870
 right and now i will produce the right one 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.910
 almost no weapon oscillations 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.910
 it was please machine 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 auto-moto 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.890
 here is somewhat more complicated because here 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.530
 There is no warning you need on 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.869
 Throughout the press of the shutter 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.180
 simultaneous aiming hook 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.130
 sara equally gradually 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.020
 increase trigger pressure 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.520
 in order not to dislodge 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.899
 arms and from out the right lane by 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.630
 relation to the correct position 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.340
 now I will show you what a drastic 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 pulling the trigger 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.399
 that is, in this case happened 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.039
 triggering only index finger 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.399
 but also the muscles of the left and right arm 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.789
 practically the entire body is sharp 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:02.310
 the weapon went down and that's it right 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.310
 pull the trigger 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.460
 I machine stands still occur you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.690
 the natural question is what's in combat 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.400
 conditions we can not squeeze so 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.560
 trigger ie produce 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.730
 slow shot yes naturally with you 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.850
 agree but in any case you must 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.060
 push the trigger correctly 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 if i speak for training shooter 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.130
 should press slowly gradually 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.620
 smoothly and constantly on the trigger 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.640
 then in combat conditions only changes 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.900
 only one condition one word in combat 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.020
 conditions you must 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.010
 pull the trigger fast 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.600
 but still smoothly constantly amplifying 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.600
 pulling the trigger
