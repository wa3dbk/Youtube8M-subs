 This would be Eki' 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.030
 Because it is dangerous 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.560

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.000
 I thought I could tell you the direction 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.990
 That's not true Endo garden darpa 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.950
 It is featured in the festival with Enter No Ender Ender eye 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.660
 It is useless if there is no ender eye 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.660
 I can not remember at all 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.249

 It is the love of hardy fenders 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:52.249
 I think it was no good without 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.860
 Just this little sister so as not to touch and place this magma 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:05:00.050
 Kane whether useless for Once you have destroyed 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.210
 This is also Wakan at all it is Toka whether we should destroy the Supona of this silver fish 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.230
 Please let me know in the comments 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:11.250
 Next time the main water splashed 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.250
 And so little dangerous but I think that want it came Kichi 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:20.729
 So please tell me comment Dechotto Thus, since not doing a little 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:25.840
 Sabai is not a survivor 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:29.200
 Because people who were playing only creative mode tax Kone Kone because it has not been recovered 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.230
 Abuna dangerous Abuna is you guys dangerous 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.230

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.750
 Basically, I this Silver Fish 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.900
 Let's destroy it because it is cake 1 death 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.910

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.720
 Yes goodbye 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:52.190
 It is goodbye because I can only get experience from the good bar 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.190
 Whatever only this I 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:02.050
 Why only one 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.050
 I wonder if such does it mean N or centerpiece Arekore 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:10.860

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.590
 You can destroy this 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.760
 I wonder if I can destroy it 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.050
 Yes 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:28.130
 We discovered that yes 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:32.590
 Since the form to bounce in here to go to the End that Ender 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:35.889

 And I later little portal of Nether next to it Te I'd like to make in Jiendo 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.870

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:51.710
 I would like to create a place where I can move momentarily 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.710
 Body of yes 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.000

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.620
 This is that 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.620
 I'm an East Summoner . 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.060
 library 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.000
 It is a great bookshelf completed 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.290

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.290

 It's really real It's really great 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:24.139
 It was confusing to make , so I decided to use an enchantment table, but this one 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.790
 I was able to solve it 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:33.090
 This is good 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:39.990

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.080
 Connect to the end 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:50.580
 It looks like a portal 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:55.310
 Something all little here not until the next time, so because you already have here 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:57.280
