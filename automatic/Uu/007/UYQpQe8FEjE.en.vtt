00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
crits now that you've analyzed your

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.919 
crits now that you've analyzed your
tracks<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.340> should<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.240> waveform<00:00:15.809> data

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
tracks you should have the waveform data

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.980 
tracks you should have the waveform data
and<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.619> BPM<00:00:17.010> reading<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.550> loaded<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.750> track

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
and a BPM reading I loaded up a track

and a BPM reading I loaded up a track
here<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.439> left<00:00:19.859> deck<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> we're<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
here on left deck and we're going to be

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.570 
here on left deck and we're going to be
going<00:00:21.510> through<00:00:21.660> how<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.740> proper<00:00:22.890> beat

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
going through how to do a proper beat

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.769 
going through how to do a proper beat
grid<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:24.150> thing<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> want<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> make<00:00:24.750> sure

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
grid first thing you want to make sure

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.560 
grid first thing you want to make sure
is<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.590> BPM<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> track<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.390> set

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
is that your BPM for the track is set

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.599 
is that your BPM for the track is set
correctly<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:28.920> determine<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
correctly as this will determine the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.840 
correctly as this will determine the
spacing<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.960> beat<00:00:31.109> grid<00:00:31.320> itself<00:00:31.790> you<00:00:32.790> can

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
spacing of the beat grid itself you can

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
spacing of the beat grid itself you can
see<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.600> tractor<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.829> gotten<00:00:35.790> very

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
see here that tractor has gotten very

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.240 
see here that tractor has gotten very
close<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> correct<00:00:36.899> BPM<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
close to the correct BPM but it is a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.619 
close to the correct BPM but it is a
little<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.910> off<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.850> 34.99<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
little bit off it's at one 34.99 for and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.069 
little bit off it's at one 34.99 for and
it's<00:00:43.110> supposed<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.860> 135<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:45.930> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it's supposed to be at 135 you can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's supposed to be at 135 you can
easily<00:00:46.260> correct<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.940> simply

bee grid when we place it will be at
exactly<00:00:57.859> 135<00:00:58.859> BPM<00:00:59.210> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> tractor

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
exactly 135 BPM you can see the tractor

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
exactly 135 BPM you can see the tractor
has<00:01:01.530> determined<00:01:02.520> where<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.879> thinks<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.359> beads

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
has determined where it thinks the beads

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.460 
has determined where it thinks the beads
are<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.409> these<00:01:04.589> white<00:01:04.920> lines<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:06.470> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
are with these white lines here but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
are with these white lines here but
we're<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> go<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> create<00:01:08.700> our<00:01:08.939> own

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
we're going to go in and create our own

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
we're going to go in and create our own
beat<00:01:09.360> grid<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.530> tell<00:01:10.680> tractor

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
beat grid and that will tell tractor

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
beat grid and that will tell tractor
exactly<00:01:11.670> where<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> beats<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.720> one

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
exactly where all of the beats are one

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.929 
exactly where all of the beats are one
of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> great<00:01:13.710> new<00:01:13.890> features<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.549> traktor<00:01:14.909> pro

of the great new features of traktor pro
2<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> zoom<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:17.280> farther

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
2 is that you can zoom in much farther

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.359 
2 is that you can zoom in much farther
than<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> could<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.240> traktor<00:01:18.630> pro<00:01:18.659> 1<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> let's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
than you could in traktor pro 1 so let's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
than you could in traktor pro 1 so let's
zoom<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> way<00:01:21.299> by<00:01:21.630> pressing<00:01:22.049> this

in so that we can really see where the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
in so that we can really see where the
first<00:01:27.570> beat<00:01:27.780> starts<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.250> move

the beat closest to the track indicator
that<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> center<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> we'll<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
that you see in the center so we'll just

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.310 
that you see in the center so we'll just
click<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> drag<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.810> close

as we can to the very first beat and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960 
as we can to the very first beat and
it's<00:01:43.470> okay<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> leave<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's okay if you leave a little bit of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.569 
it's okay if you leave a little bit of
space<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.680> tractor<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.340> into

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
space as tractor will take that into

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
space as tractor will take that into
account<00:01:47.659> next<00:01:48.659> we're<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> hit<00:01:49.079> this

account next we're going to hit this
button<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:51.299> add<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.990> grid<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
button here to add the grid you see that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179 
button here to add the grid you see that
what<00:01:54.540> tractor<00:01:55.020> thought<00:01:55.320> where<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> beats<00:01:55.920> was

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
what tractor thought where the beats was

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
what tractor thought where the beats was
actually<00:01:56.670> incorrect<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.810> those<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.170> now

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
actually incorrect and those are now

the<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.530> beat<00:02:01.770> lined<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.189> correctly<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the first beat lined up correctly but to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.350 
the first beat lined up correctly but to
make<00:02:03.750> sure<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.350> dbgrid<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.579> correct

make sure that dbgrid is correct
throughout<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> track<00:02:06.990> let's<00:02:07.979> take<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> look

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
throughout the track let's take a look

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.220 
throughout the track let's take a look
at<00:02:08.789> some<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> other<00:02:09.270> beats<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.319> track

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
at some of the other beats in the track

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.320 
at some of the other beats in the track
I'm<00:02:12.069> going<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.709> Skip<00:02:14.709> Beat<00:02:15.330> function

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
I'm going to use the Skip Beat function

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.080 
I'm going to use the Skip Beat function
on<00:02:16.510> my<00:02:16.750> midi<00:02:16.930> controller<00:02:17.409> and<00:02:17.909> we'll<00:02:18.909> go

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
on my midi controller and we'll go

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.930 
on my midi controller and we'll go
through<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.480> few<00:02:20.049> of<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.319> first<00:02:20.560> beads<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:23.940> can

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
through a few of the first beads you can

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.300 
through a few of the first beads you can
see<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.480> all<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.049> beats<00:02:26.319> line<00:02:27.069> up

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
see that all of the beats line up

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.850 
see that all of the beats line up
exactly<00:02:27.549> with<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.840> track<00:02:29.170> indicator<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.830> the
