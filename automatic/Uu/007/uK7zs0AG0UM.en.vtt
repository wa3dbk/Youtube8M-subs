are not so accurate the wheel bats are a
little<00:01:16.619> different<00:01:17.010> design<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.270> on

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
little different design than what was on

we're taking a look at the windshields
they<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.470> especially<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
they look really good especially the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800

front windshield it's a little bit short
but<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:27.990> bad<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.740> rear<00:01:28.920> windshield<00:01:29.189> should

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
but not bad the rear windshield should

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
but not bad the rear windshield should
be<00:01:29.729> pointed<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.479> longer<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.140> an

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
be pointed and much longer for an

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
be pointed and much longer for an
accuracy<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> standpoint<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.150> okay

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
accuracy of standpoint but that's okay

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.330
