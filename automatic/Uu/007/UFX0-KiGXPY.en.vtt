00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.950
 mehsud myth 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.470
 these funny little pots are still gil 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.970
 again 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.320
 I'm still for zoopa or something like that 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.740

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.910
 ap john 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 the rolfi do not deliver 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.910
 that's why now I have my 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.490
 harper sent 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.020
 to fill it 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 from there kitchen floor we have a wand 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 in augusta 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910
 and we have the room 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.580
 a room 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.120
 pretty 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.730
 the only thing that I put to this place is that 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.580
 see the counts that the internet is a cable channel and these corner tests 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.240
 rivero 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 August 9 will see Navarre easier 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.140
 sit here work 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 that there is an interpele data connection to know more data but 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.530
 today it has been good that you big data 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.420
 because it is very bad here, the table is very short and there is no equal 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.790
 work but 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 but without making a like 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.289
 6th with the room 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.289
 and the fourth 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.849
 those milestones are 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.340
 the room has two beds are supposed to move a room that has a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 Maybe bed is more to be vacated because they go to the place 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 the TV 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.809
 hi, they gave me a drink 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.369
 so 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.619
 anyway I write to the local poster blog to see a couple of movies 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.579
 from there before the bathroom we have a hundred percent dress 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
 a very fine minimalist esther 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.109
 I like it better than yesterday 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.829
 forever 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.889
 always the carpets like maybe a little more 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.889
 the most bad spine then tegueste floors and laminated up 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.089
 it's pretty good for me 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:12.279
 Well this one has more success and hence the super mini bathroom 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.259
 there is not much what 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.259
 that musaví de sacyl 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.149
 also something else 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.879
 I do not understand how 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 above the fair rate is the little window 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.289
 do not look 84 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.579
 the video is transparent 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.139
 ana kill that almirón there in two opposite rooms or something like that 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.099
 he ate the uepc 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:44.739
 then 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.629
 basically this is my 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.009
 my new room my house next for the 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.469
 for two months 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.099
 efe 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.479
 and then I'll be telling you how 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.479
 I also liked let's play 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.230
