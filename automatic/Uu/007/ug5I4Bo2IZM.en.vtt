00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
of the week anyway yeah it's a bit of a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
of the week anyway yeah it's a bit of a
stronger<00:02:00.299> field<00:02:00.600> obviously<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.530> don't<00:02:02.159> think

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
stronger field obviously I don't think

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.630 
stronger field obviously I don't think

very nice horse suppose we don't know

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.390 
very nice horse suppose we don't know
about<00:02:09.179> Australia<00:02:10.170> inform<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
about Australia inform on this on the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
about Australia inform on this on the
surface<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.120> very<00:02:12.390> good<00:02:12.540> horse

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
surface but it's very good horse

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.420 
surface but it's very good horse
lucky<00:02:13.840> nine<00:02:13.990> if<00:02:14.380> he<00:02:14.500> takes<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.890> service<00:02:15.250> he'll

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
lucky nine if he takes the service he'll

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.130 
lucky nine if he takes the service he'll
definitely<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.819> those<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.209> beat<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.900> obviously

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
definitely be those to beat so obviously

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.260 
definitely be those to beat so obviously
I<00:02:17.200> think<00:02:17.349> it's<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> bit<00:02:17.650> stronger<00:02:17.860> field

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
I think it's a bit stronger field

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.430 
I think it's a bit stronger field
obviously<00:02:19.270> opposed<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.870> last<00:02:20.020> year<00:02:20.230> you've

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
obviously opposed to last year you've

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.660 
obviously opposed to last year you've
drawn<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> lot<00:02:20.830> better<00:02:21.010> than<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.250> opposition

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
drawn a lot better than the opposition

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.890 
drawn a lot better than the opposition
this<00:02:21.790> time<00:02:22.000> around<00:02:22.239> must<00:02:22.450> give<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> little

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
this time around must give you a little

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.420 
this time around must give you a little
bit<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.080> confidence<00:02:23.290> yes<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> draw<00:02:24.400> that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
bit of confidence yes the draw that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.450 
bit of confidence yes the draw that
draws<00:02:24.940> enough<00:02:25.239> over
