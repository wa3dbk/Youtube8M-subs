00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 the name iton simon 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.100
 mess 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.350
 today we will not be the owner 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.350
 today I'm just going to show you some of the 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.039
 with the windows key 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.669
 in gundogdu track 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.850
 many of these commands firmly in 2 x tekken 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.519
 and in buin dous 7 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.859
 full we start with the basic 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.630
 that the windows key alone 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.869
 this what it does is that it simply opens the start menu 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.330
 and now 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
 suppose they have several windows open 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.080
 and someone is going to get there 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.520
 and they want to close them 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.550
 just lock the windows + t key 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.590
 and that's going to hide the entire desk 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.920
 rather it will not show the desktop 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 i 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 as a company 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 and suppose that who again opened all 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 and do not hide those who finally have a window open now as before 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 and here to hide 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400
 the one that minimize it will make it very nice another key 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.880
 windows phone and that will minimize 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.480
 and to return it simply press no 2 7 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.040
 more have 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.700
 and that returns the window 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.870
 where it was 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.030
 so windows if I lied to you mendoza m 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.300
 to 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.640
 if you get to go from your tabs in the toolbar from one to another 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.980
 but it does not have to be 'nole' with the mouse 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.370
 simply weigh in windows more the athlete had 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460
 and that's what he's going to do is that he's going to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.990
 to your toolbar 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.710
 ips with the right or left keys 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.240
 can go from implementing a window 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.340
 one hour after the entrance 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.240
 and there it is 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.299
 after pointing out that street junÃ­n 2 more per hundred 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.529
 that what the homage to a style that run the command of evil 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.609
 run in Spanish 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.199
 and here they can run 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.279
 any 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.259
 command what they want 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.799
 toselli to windows 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.059
 the letter g 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.909
 records 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.529
 coke another would be windows 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.979
 and the key 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.759
 and the key them 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.759
 is what he is going to do 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.049
 I was heard 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.439
 this what it does is that the stimulus you on your computer and the return and 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.959
 ammunition 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.659
 d the luso nike inc inc decision 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
 type your other visual signal 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.859
 password 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.979
 windows and the efe key this speaks 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.349
 the search window here can search 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.769
 files they have on their computer 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.379
 and me that in 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.719
 other wounds 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.379
 It is very good 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.729
 windows and the queens key 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.569
 this opens his team 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.789
 and that you can go to his theses with his two boys units of egypt hour 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.119
 although 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.879
 this this acquisition the pressing 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.209
 very few use it 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.319
 and it's the classic art of windows + x which is the mobility center 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.269
 Iniesta can handle your volume 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.179
 Idyll of your screen 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.369
 and several other things 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.369
 - max x 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:36.989
 now another 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.829
 adams 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.659
 Many of them use to change the window by pressing the tabs that tab 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.799
 that has windows percent view in that its arguments and the key 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.539
 tabulator 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.449
 and of factum bring what is he 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.889
 min 3 hence more filippini points 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:58.249
 in English 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:59.879
 so that he walks window 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.660
 now they have to be pushing 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.989
 that's a different way is that if they press who to leave alone loves 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.040
 all the time like this 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 it is a windows calculator control 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.149
 and with the right keys 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.199
 the dates on the right can be moved from window to window 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.830
 one 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.110
 not one 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.730
 another very very useful moment 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.659
 noted that the match started 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.569
 if we even take April 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.059
 tehran tel peruano 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:36.080
 body 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.020
 like that number starting on the left side 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.930
 they pout 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.930
 just like kumo desserts 4 5 6 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.639
 and even those who may have available 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.650
 to 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.350
 it was then number two 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.949
 3 the second set your keyboard 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.219
 in this case 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.610
 and that opens the program 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.259
 that they chose in this case would be fox failure which were translated 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.169
 it's ready 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.020
 and good without 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.880
 suppose they forget media player in seconds plus 4 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 and open the player 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.430
 even not 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.919
 it would be everything 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.499
 any question they have 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:25.859
 they wrote the script with some time they answered 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:35.809
 now percent that's me
