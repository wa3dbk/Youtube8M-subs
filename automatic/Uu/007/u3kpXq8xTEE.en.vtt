00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
breakthrough in this releases we decided

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.299 
breakthrough in this releases we decided
to<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.540> API<00:00:36.899> separate<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> display

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.760 
to have an API separate from the display
list<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.090> basically<00:00:39.750> its<00:00:39.989> own<00:00:40.170> world<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
list that is basically its own world and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
list that is basically its own world and
access<00:00:41.340> group<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:41.820> fast<00:00:42.180> enough<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
access group is now fast enough that you

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
access group is now fast enough that you
can<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> lot<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> stuff<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> scripting

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
can do a lot of stuff in the scripting

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
can do a lot of stuff in the scripting
language<00:00:45.390> rather<00:00:45.989> than<00:00:46.140> having<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> bacon

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

into<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> player<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.700> literally<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.180> new<00:00:48.480> way

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
into the player it's literally a new way

into the player it's literally a new way
to<00:00:48.690> render<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> new<00:00:49.890> design

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

architecture<00:00:51.000> inside<00:00:51.510> flash<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
architecture inside flash so the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
architecture inside flash so the
developer<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.430> coding<00:00:53.850> against<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> single<00:00:54.480> set

of<00:00:54.780> API<00:00:55.170> which<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.590> call<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> molten<00:00:56.219> aps<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
of API which we call the molten aps and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.630 
of API which we call the molten aps and
then<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> magic<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> hood<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
then we do the magic in the hood you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
then we do the magic in the hood you
have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> make<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> lot<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.539> choices<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.260> what

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have to make a lot of choices and what

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
have to make a lot of choices and what
you<00:01:01.739> put<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> hippie<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> wat<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.910> allow

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you put in the hippie I wat you allow

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.570 
you put in the hippie I wat you allow
people<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:05.100> even<00:01:05.159> harder

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
people to do and they even harder

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
people to do and they even harder
choices<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.990> include<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
choices what you do not include in the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.850 
choices what you do not include in the
API<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.790> actually<00:01:09.270> made<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> API<00:01:09.930> tailored<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
API we actually made the API tailored to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
API we actually made the API tailored to
what<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.549> do<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.150> mobile<00:01:12.570> devices<00:01:12.600> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
what we can do on on mobile devices so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
what we can do on on mobile devices so
once<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> author<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.790> content<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
once you author it content on the

what<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.100> do<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.460> directly<00:01:25.880> send<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.570> picture

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870

lot<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.590> thing<00:01:54.740> because<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.400> get<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:56.000> power

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
lot of thing because you get the power

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.880 
lot of thing because you get the power
of<00:01:56.450> mobile<00:01:56.630> with<00:01:56.930> its<00:01:57.290> new<00:01:57.470> rendering

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
of mobile with its new rendering

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.460 
of mobile with its new rendering
architecture<00:01:58.850> plus<00:01:59.450> all<00:01:59.870> the<00:02:00.110> features<00:02:00.290> that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
architecture plus all the features that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.920 
architecture plus all the features that
you<00:02:00.650> have<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.890> class<00:02:01.000> suddenly<00:02:02.000> if<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.810> are

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
you have in class suddenly if you are

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930 
you have in class suddenly if you are
the<00:02:03.110> 3d<00:02:03.440> content<00:02:03.680> everybody<00:02:04.340> come<00:02:04.550> watch<00:02:04.760> it

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
the 3d content everybody come watch it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.820 
the 3d content everybody come watch it
you'll<00:02:05.240> be<00:02:05.360> able<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.630> use<00:02:05.840> those<00:02:06.050> three<00:02:06.260> DP<00:02:06.650> is

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
you'll be able to use those three DP is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.940 
you'll be able to use those three DP is
to<00:02:07.580> basically<00:02:07.790> do<00:02:08.330> anything<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:09.110> screen<00:02:09.350> all

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
to basically do anything the screen all

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.580 
to basically do anything the screen all
these<00:02:10.190> games<00:02:10.460> that<00:02:11.060> exists<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.900> 3d<00:02:12.110> now<00:02:12.350> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
these games that exists in 3d now and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.050 
these games that exists in 3d now and
the<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:13.040> done<00:02:13.220> now<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.520> could<00:02:13.610> be<00:02:13.670> moved<00:02:13.880> to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
the can be done now it could be moved to

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.060 
the can be done now it could be moved to
the<00:02:14.090> flash<00:02:14.360> player<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.290> also<00:02:15.440> 2d<00:02:15.830> games

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
the flash player but it's also 2d games

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.280 
the flash player but it's also 2d games
I'm<00:02:16.430> really<00:02:16.670> excited<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.780> notion<00:02:18.260> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
I'm really excited about the notion that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.080 
I'm really excited about the notion that
existing<00:02:18.860> 2d<00:02:19.220> games<00:02:19.430> will<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:19.760> way<00:02:19.880> faster

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
existing 2d games will get way faster

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.240 
existing 2d games will get way faster
way<00:02:20.450> more<00:02:20.660> expressive<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.680> actually<00:02:22.070> there's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
way more expressive so actually there's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.800 
way more expressive so actually there's
no<00:02:22.460> limits<00:02:22.880> on<00:02:23.030> what<00:02:23.090> you're<00:02:23.480> gonna<00:02:23.570> be<00:02:23.720> able

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
no limits on what you're gonna be able

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:35.470 
no limits on what you're gonna be able
to<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:24.170> with<00:02:24.320> mohel

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.540
