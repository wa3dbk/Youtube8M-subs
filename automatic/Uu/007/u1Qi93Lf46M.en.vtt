00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hello everyone in YouTube land just

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.329 
hello everyone in YouTube land just
wanted<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.350> bring<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.680> up<00:00:04.710> today<00:00:04.920> what<00:00:05.220> I've

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
wanted to bring you up today what I've

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.220 
wanted to bring you up today what I've
been<00:00:05.490> doing

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
been doing

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.610 
been doing
building<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.290> row<00:00:07.440> start<00:00:07.740> printer<00:00:09.410> show<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
building a row start printer show you a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.370 
building a row start printer show you a
few<00:00:10.830> things<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.400> I've<00:00:11.519> done<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:12.139> make<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
few things that I've done to make it a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.099 
few things that I've done to make it a
little<00:00:13.530> better<00:00:14.929> I've<00:00:16.640> used<00:00:17.720> two<00:00:18.720> bearings

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
little better I've used two bearings

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.920 
little better I've used two bearings
instead<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> idler<00:00:20.810> because<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
instead of one on the idler because the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.840 
instead of one on the idler because the
belt<00:00:22.140> wants<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> walk<00:00:22.710> back<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.010> forth<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
belt wants to walk back and forth just a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.429 
belt wants to walk back and forth just a
tad

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
tad

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.810 
tad
instead<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> putting<00:00:25.740> washers<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
instead of putting washers on the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.299 
instead of putting washers on the
outside<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.359> each<00:00:27.480> bearing<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> using<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
outside of each bearing the using a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.680 
outside of each bearing the using a
washer<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:33.180> tend<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> make<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> belt<00:00:35.160> drag

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
washer will tend to make the belt drag

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.729 
washer will tend to make the belt drag
so<00:00:36.690> putting<00:00:37.350> two<00:00:37.730> bearings<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.960> alleviated

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so putting two bearings it alleviated

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.240 
so putting two bearings it alleviated
the<00:00:40.980> problem<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> bearing<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> belt

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the problem so the bearing for the belt

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.130 
the problem so the bearing for the belt
stays<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> bearing<00:00:49.010> i've<00:00:50.010> also

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
stays on the bearing i've also

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
stays on the bearing i've also
incorporated<00:00:52.140> tensioners<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.100> each<00:00:53.309> belt<00:00:55.820> see

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
incorporated tensioners on each belt see

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
incorporated tensioners on each belt see
it<00:00:56.910> better<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:58.640> clamp<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> belt<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it better here clamp the belt to a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.640 
it better here clamp the belt to a
bracket<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> bracket<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
bracket and a bracket up here put a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.730 
bracket and a bracket up here put a
screw<00:01:05.010> through<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.540> where<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.810> apply

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
screw through it where I can apply

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
screw through it where I can apply
tension<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> belt<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.270> tightening

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
tension to the belt just by tightening

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
tension to the belt just by tightening
the<00:01:09.750> screw<00:01:11.390> also<00:01:12.390> I've<00:01:12.570> made<00:01:12.810> bushings<00:01:13.430> upper

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the screw also I've made bushings upper

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
the screw also I've made bushings upper
and<00:01:14.610> lower<00:01:14.790> bushings<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.689> these<00:01:16.020> rods<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and lower bushings on these rods to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.219 
and lower bushings on these rods to
where<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.820> holds<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.479> idler<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:20.159> base

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
where it holds the idler and the base

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.810 
where it holds the idler and the base
perfectly<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.350> place<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:26.159> where<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.640> put

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
perfectly in place to where I can put

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
perfectly in place to where I can put
tension<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> belt<00:01:27.570> without<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.520> plastic

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
tension on the belt without the plastic

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.749 
tension on the belt without the plastic
parts<00:01:29.850> moving

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.240 

I've<00:01:34.270> built<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.630> frame<00:01:35.049> out<00:01:35.469> of<00:01:35.740> plexiglass

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I've built a frame out of plexiglass

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.550 
I've built a frame out of plexiglass
that<00:01:39.250> makes<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.270> whole<00:01:40.450> printer<00:01:41.229> or<00:01:41.380> more

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
that makes the whole printer or more

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.830 
that makes the whole printer or more
rigid<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:44.789> I've<00:01:45.789> done<00:01:45.939> both<00:01:46.179> sides<00:01:46.210> rather

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
rigid so I've done both sides rather

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.520 
rigid so I've done both sides rather
than<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.649> one<00:01:47.860> side<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.490> row<00:01:48.670> stock

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
than the one side that the row stock

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.179 
than the one side that the row stock
normally<00:01:50.530> incorporates<00:01:54.539> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:57.009> I've

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
normally incorporates and then I've

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.690 
normally incorporates and then I've
built<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:58.740> bracket<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.890> hold<00:01:59.920> everything<00:02:00.369> out

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
built a a bracket to hold everything out

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.609 
built a a bracket to hold everything out
of<00:02:00.729> plexiglass<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:05.310> printed<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:08.470> where

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
of plexiglass and printed this to where

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.370 
of plexiglass and printed this to where
it<00:02:08.709> holds<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.069> fan<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:10.660> able<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.929> hinge<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.260> out

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
it holds a fan be able to hinge it out

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.229 
it holds a fan be able to hinge it out
of<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.530> way<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.709> check<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.670> wiring<00:02:12.880> or

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
of the way to check the wiring or

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:21.690 
of the way to check the wiring or
whatever<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:21.459> I've

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
whatever you have to do and then I've

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.650 
whatever you have to do and then I've
used<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:23.110> same<00:02:23.140> bracket<00:02:23.829> to<00:02:24.040> hold<00:02:24.069> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
used the same bracket to hold the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.740 
used the same bracket to hold the
display<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.410> then<00:02:29.590> when<00:02:29.799> I<00:02:29.829> wire<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.750> printer

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
display and then when I wire the printer

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.650 
display and then when I wire the printer
up<00:02:31.930> I'll<00:02:32.349> just<00:02:32.410> come<00:02:33.280> through<00:02:33.310> here<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.090> put

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
up I'll just come through here and put

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.470 
up I'll just come through here and put
it<00:02:34.750> inside<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.040> wire<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.370> up<00:02:36.610> whatever<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.239> need

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it inside and wire it up whatever I need

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:49.949 
it inside and wire it up whatever I need
to<00:02:37.599> do<00:02:40.139> lift<00:02:41.139> up<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> sand<00:02:41.739> with<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.100> wiring

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.690 

so

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.740 

I<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:53.840> yet<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.140> build<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.680> hot<00:02:55.190> end<00:02:55.569> which<00:02:56.569> I

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
I have yet to build a hot end which I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.979 
I have yet to build a hot end which I
want<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.170> do<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.650> print<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.370> beeper<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.270> EPS<00:02:59.660> but

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
want to do is print a beeper not EPS but

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.059 
want to do is print a beeper not EPS but
two<00:03:00.170> nylon<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.010> Elrond<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.980> that'll<00:03:03.980> be

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
two nylon and Elrond and that'll be

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.770 
two nylon and Elrond and that'll be
something<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:05.000> don't<00:03:05.060> want<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.390> experiment

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
something they don't want to experiment

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.040 
something they don't want to experiment
with<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:07.220> that's<00:03:07.459> where<00:03:07.670> I'm<00:03:07.760> at<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.300> just

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
with so that's where I'm at I just
