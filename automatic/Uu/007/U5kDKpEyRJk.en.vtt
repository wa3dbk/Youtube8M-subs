Qi no no no it's not picked up she we
still<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.840> not<00:00:34.170> decided<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.270> supplier<00:00:36.270> yet

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
still have not decided on a supplier yet

this<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> actually<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.700> only<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> mock-up<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.570> see

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
this is actually a only a mock-up to see

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.350 
this is actually a only a mock-up to see
how<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:41.070> look<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.820> decide<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
how it could look like if we decide to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
how it could look like if we decide to
go<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.140> fuselage<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.879> do

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
go for it to your fuselage and you do

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.190 
go for it to your fuselage and you do
haven't<00:00:45.270> decided<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> have

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
haven't decided if you want to have

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.600 
haven't decided if you want to have

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.420 
resistive or or Wacom digitizer or
capacitive<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> capacitive

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
capacitive we can go for the capacitive

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
capacitive we can go for the capacitive
solution<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.210> possible<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.960> possible

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
solution it's possible it's possible

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.470 
solution it's possible it's possible
it's<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.620> possible<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:56.399> soon<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.360> make

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it's all possible how soon can you make

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
it's all possible how soon can you make
it<00:00:57.600> work<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.609> released

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it work when it's going to be released

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.439 
it work when it's going to be released
maybe<00:01:00.120> ha<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:01.710> aim<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.489> end<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> year

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
maybe ha we aim for end of the year

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
maybe ha we aim for end of the year
beginning<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.960> next<00:01:04.170> year<00:01:04.500> nice<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.280> also

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
beginning of next year nice and you also

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
beginning of next year nice and you also
have<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.790> prototype<00:01:06.270> over<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.810> that's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
have one prototype over here that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
have one prototype over here that's
actually<00:01:07.320> working<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.060> based

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
actually working and what is this based

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.789 
actually working and what is this based
on<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.650> based<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.420> this

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
on this is based on what is this

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.870 
on this is based on what is this
capacitive<00:01:13.799> touch<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.700> an

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
capacitive touch but this is not an

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
capacitive touch but this is not an
e-reader<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.720> rather<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.200> pasta<00:01:16.650> machine

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
e-reader this is rather a pasta machine

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.100 
e-reader this is rather a pasta machine
and<00:01:17.220> say<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:18.360> people<00:01:18.750> who<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.960> in

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and say for people who are in

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
and say for people who are in
restaurants<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> order

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
restaurants and when you want to order

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.140 
restaurants and when you want to order
yeah<00:01:21.200> they<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> device

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
yeah they we have they will put a device

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260 
yeah they we have they will put a device
on<00:01:24.509> every<00:01:25.290> table<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:26.250> order<00:01:26.520> drinks<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:27.000> food

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
on every table to order drinks on food

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.340 
on every table to order drinks on food
and<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:28.759> go<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> menu<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.990> somewhere

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and they can go to menu go somewhere

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.430 
and they can go to menu go somewhere
here

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
here

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.550 
here
we<00:01:32.980> get<00:01:33.130> basically<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.520> big<00:01:33.670> browser<00:01:33.940> browser

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we get basically a big browser browser

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.460 
we get basically a big browser browser
you<00:01:35.560> order<00:01:35.890> something<00:01:36.840> articles<00:01:37.840> through<00:01:38.230> to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
you order something articles through to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.740 
you order something articles through to
the<00:01:38.620> waiter<00:01:38.830> we<00:01:39.730> were<00:01:39.850> sitting<00:01:40.060> at<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.630> end

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
the waiter we were sitting at the end

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.930 
the waiter we were sitting at the end
computer<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.590> give<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.040> right<00:01:42.070> thanks<00:01:42.820> to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
computer you can give it right thanks to

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.970 
computer you can give it right thanks to
cheese<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:43.720> how<00:01:43.900> much<00:01:44.050> will<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.320> one<00:01:44.710> cost

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
cheese so how much will this one cost

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.520 
cheese so how much will this one cost
compared<00:01:45.760> to<00:01:45.910> eating<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:47.170> surprise

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
compared to eating when surprise

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.270 
compared to eating when surprise
difference<00:01:47.950> price<00:01:48.640> difference<00:01:49.240> should<00:01:49.720> be<00:01:50.110> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
difference price difference should be a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.800 
difference price difference should be a
little<00:01:51.280> bit<00:01:51.520> lower<00:01:51.760> but<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.060> can't<00:01:52.360> do<00:01:52.510> it

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
little bit lower but I can't do it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.560 
little bit lower but I can't do it
because<00:01:52.960> depends<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.520> panel<00:01:54.850> itself<00:01:54.970> is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
because depends the panel itself is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.690 
because depends the panel itself is
actually<00:01:55.720> like<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.290> look<00:01:56.440> on<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> product<00:01:56.980> yeah

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
actually like you look on a product yeah

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.870 
actually like you look on a product yeah

moment<00:02:01.270> maybe<00:02:01.690> cheaper<00:02:02.110> than<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.380> ipad<00:02:03.150> maybe

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150
