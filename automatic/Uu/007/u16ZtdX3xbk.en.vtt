at<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.959> hardware<00:02:17.350> store<00:02:17.410> but<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.920> has<00:02:18.040> some

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
at the hardware store but it has some

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.400 
at the hardware store but it has some
sort<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.550> oil<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.690> creates<00:02:19.930> smoke

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
sort of oil on it that creates smoke

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.350 
sort of oil on it that creates smoke
when<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.709> heat<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:21.970> switching

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
when you heat it up so I'm switching

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.000 
when you heat it up so I'm switching
over<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.840> stainless<00:02:23.200> steel<00:02:23.410> scrubber

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
over to the stainless steel scrubber

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.009 
over to the stainless steel scrubber
material<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.519> found<00:02:24.760> online<00:02:24.940> here's<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.840> better

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
material I found online here's a better

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.400 
material I found online here's a better
look<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.420> stainless<00:02:28.840> steel<00:02:28.870> scrubber

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
look the stainless steel scrubber

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.840 
look the stainless steel scrubber
material<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:29.920> great<00:02:30.190> because<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.700> doesn't

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
material is great because it doesn't

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.880 
material is great because it doesn't
create<00:02:31.180> smoke<00:02:31.510> when<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.840> heat<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.049> up<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
create smoke when you heat it up but the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
create smoke when you heat it up but the
steel<00:02:33.160> wool<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.580> easier<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.940> compress<00:02:34.450> too

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
steel wool is easier to compress too

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.900 
steel wool is easier to compress too

slow<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.330> engine<00:02:37.630> down<00:02:38.670> let's<00:02:39.670> take<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.880> look

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
slow the engine down let's take a look

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.020 
slow the engine down let's take a look
at<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> flywheel<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:42.160> take<00:02:42.340> off<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.640> flywheel

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.479 
at the flywheel to take off the flywheel
we<00:02:43.180> need<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.450> remove<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.930> graphite<00:02:44.380> piston

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
this piston is connected to the flywheel

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.810 
this piston is connected to the flywheel
by<00:02:50.260> sliding<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.830> bearing<00:02:51.220> onto<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.580> brass

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
by sliding this bearing onto the brass

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.930 
by sliding this bearing onto the brass
rod<00:02:52.150> sticking<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.260> flywheel<00:02:53.940> this

rod sticking out of the flywheel this

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.000 
rod sticking out of the flywheel this
piston<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.480> part<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.810> an<00:02:55.930> actuator<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.500> got<00:02:56.739> from

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
piston is part of an actuator I got from

airpot<00:02:57.459> calm<00:02:57.970> on<00:02:58.209> one<00:02:58.930> side<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.290> has<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.440> ball

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
airpot calm on one side it has a ball

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.530 
airpot calm on one side it has a ball
joint<00:02:59.920> which<00:03:00.220> allows<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.730> connecting<00:03:01.150> rod<00:03:01.330> to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
joint which allows the connecting rod to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.699 
joint which allows the connecting rod to
rotate<00:03:01.959> easily<00:03:02.820> at<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.870> other<00:03:05.019> end<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.380> added<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
rotate easily at the other end I added a

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.160 
rotate easily at the other end I added a
bearing<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.400> reduce<00:03:06.700> friction<00:03:07.170> it's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
bearing to reduce friction it's

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.050 
bearing to reduce friction it's
important<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.709> handle<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.130> piston<00:03:09.489> carefully

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
important to handle the piston carefully

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.640 
important to handle the piston carefully
since<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.360> little<00:03:10.630> dirt<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.019> graphite<00:03:11.440> can

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
since a little dirt on the graphite can

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.050 
since a little dirt on the graphite can
slow<00:03:11.860> down<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.100> engine<00:03:12.580> considerably<00:03:15.060> this

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
slow down the engine considerably this

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.030 
slow down the engine considerably this
