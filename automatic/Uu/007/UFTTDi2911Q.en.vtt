00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that is how that works now to make now

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100

lock<00:03:44.550> move<00:03:45.120> over<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.569> my<00:03:45.720> glass<00:03:46.440> cabinet<00:03:46.950> put

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
lock move over to my glass cabinet put

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.050 
lock move over to my glass cabinet put
it<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.400> there

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.530 

okay<00:03:53.750> this<00:03:53.960> key<00:03:54.140> I'm<00:03:54.260> working<00:03:54.680> oh<00:03:55.300> well<00:03:56.300> that's

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
okay this key I'm working oh well that's

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.020 
okay this key I'm working oh well that's
why<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.290> order<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.520> takes<00:03:58.790> is

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
why the the order of it takes is

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.510 
why the the order of it takes is
actually<00:03:59.450> the<00:04:00.230> way<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.710> opens<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:01.130> actually

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
actually the way it opens it actually

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.980 
actually the way it opens it actually
takes<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.850> order<00:04:02.210> that<00:04:02.570> is<00:04:02.720> in<00:04:02.750> your

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
takes the order that is in your

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.620 
takes the order that is in your
inventory<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.440> if<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:03.680> have<00:04:03.890> my<00:04:04.130> 1<00:04:04.760> 2<00:04:04.880> 3<00:04:05.030> 4<00:04:05.240> 4<00:04:05.420> key

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
inventory so if I have my 1 2 3 4 4 key

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.200 
inventory so if I have my 1 2 3 4 4 key
first<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.110> now<00:04:06.230> my<00:04:06.410> 1<00:04:06.560> 2<00:04:06.650> 3<00:04:06.770> 4<00:04:07.010> 5<00:04:07.130> key<00:04:07.400> can<00:04:07.970> open

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
first and now my 1 2 3 4 5 key can open

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.360 
first and now my 1 2 3 4 5 key can open
it<00:04:08.300> but<00:04:08.420> if<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.570> have<00:04:08.660> my<00:04:08.780> 1<00:04:08.930> 2<00:04:09.080> 3<00:04:09.320> 4<00:04:09.560> 5<00:04:09.740> key<00:04:10.010> open

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
it but if I have my 1 2 3 4 5 key open

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.180 
it but if I have my 1 2 3 4 5 key open
first<00:04:10.550> or<00:04:10.850> in<00:04:11.450> my<00:04:11.600> closest<00:04:12.530> inventory<00:04:12.980> slot

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
first or in my closest inventory slot

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.699 
first or in my closest inventory slot
like<00:04:13.490> counting<00:04:13.820> from<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.120> side<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.709> can't

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
like counting from this side I can't

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.830 
like counting from this side I can't
over<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:16.730> that's<00:04:16.910> how<00:04:17.150> that<00:04:17.209> work<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.630> just

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
over to so that's how that work I just

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.199 
over to so that's how that work I just
realized<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:18.829> but<00:04:19.130> another<00:04:19.370> thing<00:04:20.090> about

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
realized that but another thing about

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.570 
realized that but another thing about
the<00:04:20.480> glass<00:04:21.260> cabinet<00:04:21.530> unfortunately<00:04:22.220> when<00:04:22.490> you

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
the glass cabinet unfortunately when you

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.990 
the glass cabinet unfortunately when you
put<00:04:22.760> items<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.330> like<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.730> crystal<00:04:25.730> chest

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
put items in it like the crystal chest

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.690 
put items in it like the crystal chest
in<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.750> forgot<00:04:30.590> what<00:04:30.710> model<00:04:30.980> is<00:04:31.160> more<00:04:31.430> chest

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
in and I forgot what model is more chest

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.090 
in and I forgot what model is more chest
I<00:04:31.820> believe<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.750> can<00:04:32.960> actually<00:04:33.230> see<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.800> items

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
I believe you can actually see the items

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.040 
I believe you can actually see the items
but<00:04:34.280> hopefully<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.730> another<00:04:34.820> update<00:04:35.360> when<00:04:35.960> you

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
but hopefully in another update when you

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.350 
but hopefully in another update when you
put<00:04:36.230> items<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:36.680> there<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.040> can<00:04:37.280> actually<00:04:37.400> see

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
put items in there you can actually see

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.570 
put items in there you can actually see
the<00:04:38.480> items<00:04:38.860> which<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.010> think<00:04:40.220> if<00:04:40.340> they<00:04:40.430> added

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
the items which I think if they added

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.550 
the items which I think if they added
that<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:40.940> would<00:04:41.060> be<00:04:41.150> pretty<00:04:41.810> sweet<00:04:42.050> feature

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
that that would be pretty sweet feature

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.909 
that that would be pretty sweet feature
here's<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.280> create<00:04:43.580> obsidian<00:04:44.620> while<00:04:45.620> all<00:04:45.740> that

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
here's to create obsidian while all that

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.010 
here's to create obsidian while all that
so<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.400> get<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.640> idea<00:04:46.910> oh<00:04:47.030> another<00:04:47.360> thing<00:04:47.480> the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
so you get the idea oh another thing the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.200 
so you get the idea oh another thing the
Obsidian<00:04:48.350> curry<00:04:48.680> is<00:04:48.890> actually<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.790> obsidian

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
Obsidian curry is actually the obsidian

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.430 
Obsidian curry is actually the obsidian
safe<00:04:50.480> my<00:04:50.780> bad<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.110> not<00:04:51.580> blast<00:04:52.580> proof<00:04:52.910> which

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
safe my bad is not blast proof which

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.990 
safe my bad is not blast proof which
kind<00:04:54.440> of<00:04:54.500> sucks<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:54.980> hopefully<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.520> next

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
kind of sucks but hopefully in a next

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.330 
kind of sucks but hopefully in a next
update<00:04:56.270> it'll<00:04:56.480> be<00:04:56.600> blast<00:04:57.290> proof<00:04:57.500> but<00:04:57.919> that<00:04:58.160> is

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
update it'll be blast proof but that is

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.920 
update it'll be blast proof but that is
