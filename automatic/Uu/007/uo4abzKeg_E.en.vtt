made at the beginning I said it took me

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.680

four attempts to record the record it
basically<00:00:14.299> but<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> think<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.750> video<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.139> just

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
basically but I think this video is just

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.769 
basically but I think this video is just
overtaking<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.150> sixth<00:00:18.720> time

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
overtaking it as this is the sixth time

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.939 
overtaking it as this is the sixth time
I'm<00:00:19.289> recording<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.990> reason<00:00:21.990> being<00:00:22.199> even

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
I'm recording this reason being even

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.259 
I'm recording this reason being even

for the characters so I'm gonna do that
first<00:00:56.940> thing<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.390> did<00:00:57.629> find<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.440> template<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.010> was

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
first thing I did find a template I was

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
first thing I did find a template I was
gonna<00:00:59.309> make<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> template<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> thought<00:01:00.750> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
gonna make a template but I thought I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.039 
gonna make a template but I thought I
found<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.160> seems<00:01:02.370> pretty<00:01:02.550> good

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
found this one which seems pretty good

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.420 
found this one which seems pretty good
so<00:01:04.049> there's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.650> claiming<00:01:05.070> making<00:01:05.309> one

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
so there's not much claiming making one

best<00:02:07.500> tool<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.940> job<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
best tool for the for this job is the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.110 
best tool for the for this job is the
pencil<00:02:10.050> tool<00:02:10.259> set<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.760> pixel

pencil tool set to one pixel

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.430 
pencil tool set to one pixel
and<00:02:13.209> then<00:02:13.659> you<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.170> paint<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.920> pixel-by-pixel

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and then you can paint on pixel-by-pixel

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.009 
and then you can paint on pixel-by-pixel
whatever<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.769> want<00:02:18.010> your<00:02:18.400> character<00:02:18.940> skin<00:02:19.569> to

what am I going to go to color balance
probably<00:02:52.420> no<00:02:54.359> it's<00:02:55.359> empty<00:02:55.720> because<00:02:56.260> I'm<00:02:56.349> on

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
I saw a comment at the bottom interested

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.849 
I saw a comment at the bottom interested
me<00:03:38.739> from<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.250> skate<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:40.090> skate<00:03:40.629> dude<00:03:40.859> saying

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
me from a skate to a skate dude saying

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.920 
me from a skate to a skate dude saying
make<00:03:42.699> a<00:03:42.730> guinea<00:03:43.030> suit<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.480> matches<00:03:43.599> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
make a guinea suit that matches the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.319 
make a guinea suit that matches the
Minecraft<00:03:44.290> grass<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:45.879> thought<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.269> would

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
Minecraft grass so I thought that would

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.170 
Minecraft grass so I thought that would
make<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.510> good<00:03:46.750> example<00:03:47.079> for<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:47.560> tutorial

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
make a good example for this tutorial

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.289 
make a good example for this tutorial
and<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.049> can<00:03:50.139> see<00:03:50.349> here<00:03:50.590> I'm<00:03:50.680> just

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
and as you can see here I'm just

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.879 
and as you can see here I'm just
speeding<00:03:52.299> up<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.750> part<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.109> video<00:03:53.349> so

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
speeding up this part of the video so

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.680 
speeding up this part of the video so
you<00:03:54.370> don't<00:03:54.549> have<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.819> sit<00:03:55.209> through<00:03:55.389> me

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
you don't have to sit through me

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.009 
you don't have to sit through me
creating<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.500> skin<00:03:57.359> it's<00:03:58.359> basically<00:03:58.750> doing

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
creating this skin it's basically doing

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.809 
creating this skin it's basically doing
about<00:03:59.199> 20<00:03:59.410> minutes<00:03:59.859> I<00:04:00.099> just<00:04:00.190> took<00:04:00.760> a

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
about 20 minutes I just took a

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.390 
about 20 minutes I just took a
screenshot<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.810> Minecraft<00:04:02.650> grass<00:04:03.010> and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
screenshot of the Minecraft grass and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.640 
screenshot of the Minecraft grass and
then<00:04:04.109> use<00:04:05.109> that<00:04:05.139> as<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.859> base<00:04:06.359> around<00:04:07.650> my

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
then use that as a base around my

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.089 
then use that as a base around my
ghillie<00:04:09.340> suit<00:04:10.379> doing<00:04:11.379> a<00:04:11.530> lot<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.769> copy<00:04:12.010> and

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
pasting of each Park so I come before

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.900 
pasting of each Park so I come before
the<00:04:14.109> drawing<00:04:14.440> everyone<00:04:14.829> up<00:04:14.980> all<00:04:15.489> over<00:04:15.549> again

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the drawing everyone up all over again

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.879 
the drawing everyone up all over again
