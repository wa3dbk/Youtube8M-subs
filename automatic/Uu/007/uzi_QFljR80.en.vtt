Today’s video is… well, it’s kind of
a long story

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.209
I’ve been trying to get burglar bars for
these windows for a very long time

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.520
I’ve had over 10 people come out and look
at them (I really want them for that window)

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.540
This window is optional
I guess what I want is rather unusual.  

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.000
Most won't even place a bid.  What

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.720
I want is instead of this aluminum frame
I want a steel frame that I can lock, place

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.320
the misquote screen on so that when I open
the burglar bars

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.820
I can open the windows. As you can see these
are very old fashioned windows

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:02.649
They open like this. I want the burglar bars
to be here so I can open them then open the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.960
window easily
Clean the window, maintain the window without

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.740
them in the way.
So what I am going to attempt to do is build

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.070
the frame I want, take it to someone and
See if they will weld the beautiful stuff

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.939
inside because I don’t have that artistic
talent.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.390
That’s the beginning of today’s project.
I’ve never done anything like this before.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.790
Again it’s really for that window over there,
but I think if I get a good sample going and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.730
take it to somebody, then maybe they will finish the rest of the job

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.520
once they see that it’s not
all that it's not impossible.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.880
Here’s where I am on this so far. I’ve

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.259
created my prototype.
There’s the swing-able inner frame and the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.829
screen window on the outer
Let’s go look at the details and 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.030
it will be a little clearer.
First I’ve got the mosquito screen that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.619
goes around the outside of the steel frame
I’ve got it taped on here. I’ll remove

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.619
it so you can see how it works.
The mosquito frame sits inside the steel frame.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.460
The red string is where the burglar bars go.
The plan right now is to have them welded

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.460
on the backside.
This frame opens. It’s on hinges. One, Two

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.190
down here.
And these barrel hinges will allow it to be

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.459
lifted out when the frame’s all the way
open.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.459
This is just sitting in here for now. I don’t
want it to fall out.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.240
There’s this thin frame that will be screwed
to the side.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:06.620
It goes all the way around.
And the swinging frame (let me step back and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.520
get a view of it) that allows me to access
the window for cleaning, opening &amp; closing,

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.620
and maintenance.
Here’s a view of it removed from the window.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.160
This is the frame that will be screwed to
the window. 1 inch bar stock.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.340
This is the swinging frame. Here are the barrel
hinges, 1 here, 1 here.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.770
The mosquito screen sits on the inside like
this so that it opens also.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.860
So I can access the window without having
to unscrew stuff.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360
It’s rather simple.
The burglar bars will be welded on this side,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.360
the mosquito screen on this side.
So this whole things swings out of the way

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:09.080
when you need to open or clean the window.
That’s it so far. So in the end I will have

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.140
a system where the mosquito screen swings
out

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.700
With this piece and the burglar bars will
be welded to the back of this frame.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.420
I’m not good enough to make a beautiful
pattern and don’t have the tools either.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.070
The plan is to take this to someone, show
it to them and see if they will carry on from

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.110
here.
The thing that’s left to do is the lock.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.650
I need a clever locking system.
In this example I ran out of this ½ inch

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.820
material but this should go all the way around.
To help keep out bugs. To allow a seal all

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.820
around.
That’s it so far. We’ve met the requirements

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of a mosquito screen and the burglar bars
swing out of the way so the window can be

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:10.680
accessed.
The last thing is the clever lock where someone

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:21.200
can’t reach through the bars. I’ll put
that on another

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.260
That should do it for now.
Hope you found it interesting.
