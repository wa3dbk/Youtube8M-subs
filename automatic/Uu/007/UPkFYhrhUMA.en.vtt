00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.820
 the palette and rs 54 is an icon within the 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.529
 river is an emblem within the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 construction in the Argentine Republic 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.869
 today here in for steel we are going to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.529
 show a totally original upholstery 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 instrumental painting all original look 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.800
 for the faithful followers of parallels 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.480
 0 will surely be well known 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.180
 this boat and that's how we showed it 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.829
 in some of our programs but it's worth 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.230
 it's worth doing the note again with 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.230
 eduardo las paletinas are a luxury and worth 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.449
 It's worth noting if the boat is 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.030
 all original as it came out of the shipyard 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.820
 of the year 80 the only thing that has been changed 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.860
 in this boat is the engine but 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.559
 then he has the yelko or the painting 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.750
 it is original the windshield botazo the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.700
 ironworks navigation lights is all 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 as it came from the shipyard 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.510
 and one of the things to stand out like you 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.640
 you mentioned is the engine itself in terms of 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.480
 the power is similar to what output 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.790
 factory from 150 to 200 hp this engine is 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.620
 of new generation and instead of being 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.410
 carbureted like they were before that injection 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.300
 is the difference of 200 horses 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.710
 apart good that is an aggregate that 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.730
 has the boat that is an elevator 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.840
 7-inch hydraulic in which one 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.460
 artificially changes the setting to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 point while it is sailing or is it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.490
 It allows to walk very calm walking to 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.620
 20 knots or if you want to walk fast towards 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.780
 a while ago the runner this good you 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.520
 gives height and angle and good the boat 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 it happens to be a little more fun 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.220
 with so a little bit of the comforts that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.560
 we found on board the seats if 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.140
 formerly bone is preserved 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.239
 let's say the distribution and in the back to 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.160
 original back this was what it was 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.370
 used at that time or not like now 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.980
 which is a back seat this boat does not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.970
 he has this one has two back games 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.830
 to back that was what was coming 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.280
 originally from the shipyard what came out 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.800
 of series have record of how many 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.270
 folletines today are browsing the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.940
 River 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.470
 look at rs 54 you should ask them 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.870
 just to harmon barbot that led 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.180
 much record of that type of data but 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.060
 I do not calculate that they have built more than 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.460
 200 east boats because it was a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.280
 boat that did not have the production that 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.170
 they had others like the luxor be done 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.930
 codines where lots of it were 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 well they will have built 200 250 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.310
 well we know that you are undertaking a 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.640
 project you are developing a project 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.480
 with give us a bit of this the project of 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.150
 This was proposed to me by German Barbot who 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.240
 is in the museum has Argentine nautical and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.460
 the idea was to put a motor on the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.790
 era of the 80s of six of that 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.440
 era and it's good that the museum has 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.290
 of the boat when they want to do some 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.210
 exhibition and so on since as is all 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.700
 original good they were interested 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.620
 just that and you also when I 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.070
 I told you in a moment you're going to 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.830
 detach from the boat no no no that 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.500
 it has the motor itself but the helmet itself 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.510
 all of us who are this nautical 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.060

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.090
