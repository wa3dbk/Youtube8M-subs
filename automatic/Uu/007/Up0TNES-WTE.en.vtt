00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
structure so what we decided to do was

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.950 
structure so what we decided to do was
move<00:00:44.739> offshore<00:00:45.040> into<00:00:45.610> deeper<00:00:45.940> water<00:00:46.150> and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
move offshore into deeper water and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.259 
move offshore into deeper water and
they've<00:00:47.739> dropped<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.280> another<00:00:48.670> six<00:00:49.089> inches

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
they've dropped it another six inches

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:58.289 
they've dropped it another six inches
making<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.369> little<00:00:57.610> stretch<00:00:57.909> of<00:00:58.089> Bank

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299

not<00:01:07.240> too<00:01:07.450> far<00:01:07.720> away<00:01:08.130> took<00:01:09.130> us<00:01:09.250> about<00:01:09.400> five<00:01:09.670> or

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
not too far away took us about five or

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.610 
not too far away took us about five or
ten<00:01:09.970> minutes<00:01:10.000> but<00:01:10.600> we<00:01:10.840> would<00:01:11.350> look<00:01:11.440> something

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
ten minutes but we would look something

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.740 
ten minutes but we would look something
here<00:01:12.310> if<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.700> can<00:01:12.850> get<00:01:12.940> another<00:01:13.150> one<00:01:13.270> not<00:01:13.450> quite

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
here if I can get another one not quite

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.810 
here if I can get another one not quite
big<00:01:13.930> enough<00:01:13.960> we<00:01:14.350> came<00:01:14.860> back<00:01:15.040> up<00:01:15.310> here<00:01:15.340> we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
big enough we came back up here we

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.600 
big enough we came back up here we
weren't<00:01:16.060> even<00:01:16.120> here<00:01:16.510> three<00:01:17.170> minutes<00:01:17.410> add<00:01:18.160> a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
weren't even here three minutes add a

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.150 
weren't even here three minutes add a
leaf<00:01:18.970> Fathead<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:20.530> almost<00:01:20.680> looks<00:01:20.980> like<00:01:21.070> a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
leaf Fathead it almost looks like a

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.970 
leaf Fathead it almost looks like a
Senko<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:22.180> then<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.690> turns<00:01:22.930> all<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.860> them

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
Senko but then it turns all of them

Senko but then it turns all of them
we're<00:01:24.370> over<00:01:24.520> three<00:01:24.940> pounds<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.480> obviously

we're over three pounds and obviously
this<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.290> biggest<00:01:26.620> so<00:01:26.920> far<00:01:26.950> 15<00:01:27.820> pounds<00:01:28.270> now

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
this is the biggest so far 15 pounds now

this is the biggest so far 15 pounds now
got<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.840> five<00:01:29.110> pounder<00:01:29.670> three<00:01:30.690> they<00:01:31.690> sit<00:01:32.020> right

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
got a five pounder three they sit right

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.110 
got a five pounder three they sit right
behind<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.860> pylon<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:33.400> they<00:01:33.490> can<00:01:33.670> get<00:01:33.820> out<00:01:33.880> of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
behind the pylon so they can get out of

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.580 
behind the pylon so they can get out of
the<00:01:34.180> current<00:01:34.510> there's<00:01:34.690> like<00:01:34.900> one<00:01:35.020> small<00:01:35.200> fish

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
the current there's like one small fish

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.950 
the current there's like one small fish
I<00:01:35.830> put<00:01:36.190> on<00:01:36.310> my<00:01:36.430> new<00:01:36.790> Berkeley<00:01:37.150> boat<00:01:37.450> sinking

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
I put on my new Berkeley boat sinking

middle ah yeah oh that's nice get that
thump<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:44.320> vibration<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> biggest<00:01:45.610> thing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
thump the vibration is the biggest thing

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.480 
thump the vibration is the biggest thing
is<00:01:46.090> time<00:01:46.300> here<00:01:46.720> tungsten<00:01:47.229> weight<00:01:47.440> then<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:48.310> also

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
is time here tungsten weight then I also

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.850 
is time here tungsten weight then I also
downsize<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.510> bait<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.050> four-inch<00:01:50.560> ten

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
downsize the bait to a four-inch ten

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.230 
downsize the bait to a four-inch ten
just<00:01:51.010> caught<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.220> fish<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:51.790> it's<00:01:51.880> still<00:01:52.120> in

just caught that fish and it's still in
perfect<00:01:52.450> shape<00:01:52.720> ready<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.440> go<00:01:53.560> get<00:01:53.710> another

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
perfect shape ready to go get another

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.039 
perfect shape ready to go get another
one

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.440 

shallow<00:01:58.049> shallow<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:59.700> catch<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.179> bigger

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
shallow shallow we catch a lot bigger

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.230 
shallow shallow we catch a lot bigger
but<00:02:00.719> yeah<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.679> got<00:02:02.009> five<00:02:02.249> of<00:02:02.460> those<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:03.000> can't

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
but yeah I got five of those we can't

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.459 
but yeah I got five of those we can't
get<00:02:03.359> another<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> funny<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.409> about

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
get another and the funny part about

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.490 
get another and the funny part about
that<00:02:04.679> was<00:02:05.359> believed<00:02:06.359> that<00:02:06.390> bait<00:02:06.750> comes<00:02:07.049> just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that was believed that bait comes just

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.039 
that was believed that bait comes just
down<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.160> angle<00:02:08.519> i<00:02:08.549> mean<00:02:08.700> i've<00:02:08.819> thrown

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
down the right angle i mean i've thrown

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.080 
down the right angle i mean i've thrown
even<00:02:10.049> almost<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> same<00:02:10.799> spot<00:02:11.090> downstate

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
even almost to the same spot downstate

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.000 
even almost to the same spot downstate
delaware<00:02:12.540> probably<00:02:13.410> one<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> bigger<00:02:13.799> lake

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
delaware probably one of the bigger lake

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.370 
delaware probably one of the bigger lake
