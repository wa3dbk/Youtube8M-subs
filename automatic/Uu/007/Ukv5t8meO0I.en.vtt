00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
obviously took a piece out there see
what<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.680> snow<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.159> Tower

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
what it is but it's my snow just Tower

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
what it is but it's my snow just Tower
and<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.450> white<00:01:45.720> blocks<00:01:46.140> without

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and you can have white blocks without

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
and you can have white blocks without
having<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.159> use<00:01:47.430> iron<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.600> make

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
having to use iron because you can make

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
having to use iron because you can make
iron<00:01:49.079> blocks<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> snow<00:01:50.790> blocks

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
iron blocks but I think the snow blocks

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
iron blocks but I think the snow blocks
are<00:01:51.270> unique<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.229> two<00:01:52.380> more

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
are unique and I'm have to get two more

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.960 
are unique and I'm have to get two more
to<00:01:52.649> replace<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.610> somebody

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to replace it here because somebody

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.749 
to replace it here because somebody
wanted<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> break<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.899> snow<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:56.009> um<00:01:56.189> yeah

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
wanted to break my snow but um yeah

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
wanted to break my snow but um yeah
that's<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.149> uses<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> snow<00:01:58.110> block<00:01:58.409> it's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that's the uses for the snow block it's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.350 
that's the uses for the snow block it's
really<00:01:58.860> cool<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.310> put<00:01:59.579> snow<00:01:59.880> balls<00:02:00.119> together

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
really cool to put snow balls together

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
really cool to put snow balls together
if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.719> hit<00:02:00.840> him<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> shovel<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> have

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
if you hit him with a shovel and have

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.039 
if you hit him with a shovel and have
epic<00:02:02.100> ass<00:02:02.280> snow<00:02:02.670> towers<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:03.899> just

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
epic ass snow towers or you could just

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.480 
epic ass snow towers or you could just
make<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> snow<00:02:04.560> village<00:02:04.950> it'd<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.250> really

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
really cool when you put together and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.670 
really cool when you put together and
you<00:02:18.569> can<00:02:18.720> make<00:02:18.840> some<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.110> sick<00:02:19.349> houses

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
you can make some pretty sick houses

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
you can make some pretty sick houses
with<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.280> also<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:21.030> affected<00:02:21.690> by

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
with it it also is not affected by

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.280 
with it it also is not affected by
gravity<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.890> won't<00:02:23.040> fall<00:02:23.310> down<00:02:23.340> like

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
gravity so it won't fall down like

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.750 
gravity so it won't fall down like
gravel<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.470> dirt<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.280> snows<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.549> really

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
gravel and dirt so it snows a really

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640 
gravel and dirt so it snows a really
good<00:02:26.909> idea<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.299> building<00:02:27.480> hope<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.379> video

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
good idea for building hope this video

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
good idea for building hope this video
