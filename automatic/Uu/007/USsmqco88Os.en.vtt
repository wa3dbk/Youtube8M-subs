there's a decent suit no bomb right in
the<00:01:01.890> center<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.989> it's<00:01:03.989> basically<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.189> center

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the center so it's basically the center

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190 
the center so it's basically the center
of<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.049> snow

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of it and there's not much of a snow

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.810 
of it and there's not much of a snow
biome<00:01:07.380> anywhere<00:01:07.770> else<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
biome anywhere else it's only in the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080 
biome anywhere else it's only in the
center<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> come<00:01:10.229> over<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
center so if you come over here this is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
center so if you come over here this is
the<00:01:12.600> pretty<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> edge<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> world

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the pretty much the edge of the world

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.170 
the pretty much the edge of the world
the<00:01:14.040> snow<00:01:14.189> biome<00:01:14.340> goes<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:14.939> over

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the snow biome goes a little bit over

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.510 
the snow biome goes a little bit over
there<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:16.409> there's<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.740> gem<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.220> where<00:01:17.430> you

up<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.840> head<00:01:54.840> over<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.110> way

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
up a little bit and head over this way

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.240 
up a little bit and head over this way
the<00:01:55.560> seed<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.280> feels<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.780> big<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.439> pop

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the seed it feels really big like pop

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
the seed it feels really big like pop
condition<00:01:59.579> worlds<00:01:59.850> are<00:02:00.000> pretty<00:02:00.299> small<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
condition worlds are pretty small I'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.060 
condition worlds are pretty small I'm
pretty<00:02:01.619> sure<00:02:01.770> they're<00:02:02.040> 250<00:02:02.579> by<00:02:02.759> 250<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:04.200> 500<00:02:04.799> by

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
pretty sure they're 250 by 250 or 500 by

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.639 
pretty sure they're 250 by 250 or 500 by
500<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.790> not<00:02:05.939> sure<00:02:06.119> about<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.780> they're

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
500 I'm not sure about that but they're

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.580 
500 I'm not sure about that but they're
small<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:09.179> definitely<00:02:09.300> say<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
small you can definitely say that so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.980 
small you can definitely say that so
this<00:02:10.800> one<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.730> feels<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
this one it feels so

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
bigger than a paw conditioned world I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.090 
bigger than a paw conditioned world I
mean<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.840> don't<00:02:16.380> know<00:02:16.440> why<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.800> does<00:02:17.390> so
