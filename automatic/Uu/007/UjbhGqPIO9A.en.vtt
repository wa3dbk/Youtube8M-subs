00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
it's easy to use you just have to make

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.810 
it's easy to use you just have to make
sure<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.590> light<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.100> green<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.910> the

indicator - in the center so you strum

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.589 
indicator - in the center so you strum
your<00:00:23.760> guitar<00:00:24.119> from<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:26.000> thickest<00:00:27.000> string<00:00:27.330> one

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
your guitar from the thickest string one

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
your guitar from the thickest string one
on<00:00:27.720> top<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.590> sixth<00:00:28.949> string<00:00:29.160> down<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
on top or the sixth string down to the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.020 
on top or the sixth string down to the
first<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.689> example

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.240 

if<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:41.829> overly<00:00:42.829> high<00:00:43.010> free<00:00:43.489> in<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:44.239> case

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.100 

you<00:00:49.250> have<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.489> bring<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.850> string<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.809> lower

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
you have to bring the string to a lower

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.840 
you have to bring the string to a lower
pitch<00:00:51.410> first

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:06.300 

and<00:00:56.329> then<00:00:56.900> slowly<00:00:57.230> adjust<00:00:57.730> upwards<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:58.940> pitch

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.280 

so<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:06.909> you<00:01:07.030> see<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.270> go<00:01:07.420> over<00:01:07.450> again<00:01:08.049> you<00:01:08.170> have

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
so if you see it go over again you have

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.700 
so if you see it go over again you have
to<00:01:08.380> bring<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.920> notch<00:01:09.850> lower

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.040 

because<00:01:13.340> if<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:13.580> try<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.820> adjust<00:01:14.030> from<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.780> high

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
because if you try to adjust from a high

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.010 
because if you try to adjust from a high
note<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> lower<00:01:15.710> note<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:17.480> pitch<00:01:17.720> could

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
note to a lower note the pitch could

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:35.100 
note to a lower note the pitch could
still<00:01:18.350> change

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.910 

you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.710 

Oh

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.280 

and<00:01:50.950> that's<00:01:51.950> how<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.190> see<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.290> junior

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290
