look at this 1.6 liter machine with 156
horsepower<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.150> course<00:00:12.389> will<00:00:12.630> try<00:00:12.900> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
horsepower and of course will try to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:35.160 
horsepower and of course will try to

their work right now but we still want
to<00:00:39.890> bother<00:00:40.130> them<00:00:40.400> for<00:00:40.580> a<00:00:40.640> second<00:00:41.030> that's<00:00:41.180> what

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
to bother them for a second that's what

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.150 
to bother them for a second that's what
they're<00:00:41.600> doing<00:00:43.840> hi<00:00:44.840> guys<00:00:45.080> just<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.560> sec<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.950> quick

they're doing hi guys just a sec a quick

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.750 
they're doing hi guys just a sec a quick
check-in<00:00:46.430> what<00:00:47.360> are<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.480> doing<00:00:47.720> right<00:00:47.840> now

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
check-in what are you doing right now

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.980 
check-in what are you doing right now
we've<00:00:49.760> determined<00:00:50.060> all<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.510> data<00:00:50.720> with<00:00:50.960> the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
we've determined all the data with the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.810 
we've determined all the data with the
diagnostic<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:51.830> troubleshooting<00:00:51.950> program

diagnostic and troubleshooting program

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.320 
diagnostic and troubleshooting program
all<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.330> voltage<00:00:53.810> values<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:54.410> need<00:00:55.330> from

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
all the voltage values that we need from

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.970 
all the voltage values that we need from
the<00:00:56.450> pressure<00:00:56.690> sensors<00:00:57.200> in<00:00:57.350> relation<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.830> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
the pressure sensors in relation to the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.080 
the pressure sensors in relation to the
reps<00:00:58.160> per<00:00:58.400> minute<00:00:59.380> you<00:01:00.380> can<00:01:00.530> see<00:01:00.650> it<00:01:00.739> here

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
reps per minute you can see it here

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.640 
reps per minute you can see it here
these<00:01:02.090> are<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.390> reps<00:01:02.630> per<00:01:02.840> minute<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.320> here's

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
these are the reps per minute and here's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.609 
these are the reps per minute and here's
the<00:01:03.830> data<00:01:04.010> from<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.370> pressure<00:01:04.550> sensor<00:01:05.619> with

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
the data from the pressure sensor with

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.590 
the data from the pressure sensor with
this<00:01:06.770> data<00:01:07.070> we're<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:07.940> going<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.300> create<00:01:08.420> a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
this data we're now going to create a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.960 
this data we're now going to create a
tuning<00:01:09.140> curve<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.710> measure<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.369> again<00:01:10.670> at<00:01:10.850> the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
tuning curve and measure it again at the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.940 
tuning curve and measure it again at the
testing<00:01:11.360> bench<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:12.350> we'll<00:01:12.680> see<00:01:12.830> the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
testing bench then we'll see the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.090 
testing bench then we'll see the
difference<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.500> doesn't<00:01:15.740> matter<00:01:15.950> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
difference so it doesn't matter that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.030 
difference so it doesn't matter that
this<00:01:16.400> isn't<00:01:16.610> automatic<00:01:17.710> it's<00:01:18.710> not<00:01:18.890> all<00:01:19.009> that

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
this isn't automatic it's not all that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740 
this isn't automatic it's not all that
easy<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.759> measure<00:01:19.910> it<00:01:20.090> with<00:01:20.240> an<00:01:20.330> automatic

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
easy to measure it with an automatic

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.359 
easy to measure it with an automatic
because<00:01:21.380> you're<00:01:21.530> measuring<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.190> lot

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
because you're measuring it a lot

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.380 
because you're measuring it a lot
differently<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:25.369> will<00:01:25.550> be<00:01:25.670> better<00:01:25.910> if<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.210> car

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
differently it will be better if the car

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.270 
differently it will be better if the car
had<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> manual<00:01:26.930> transmission<00:01:27.170> but<00:01:28.130> we'll

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
had a manual transmission but we'll

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.210 
had a manual transmission but we'll
manage<00:01:28.840> I'm<00:01:29.840> sure<00:01:30.050> you<00:01:30.200> will<00:01:30.410> so<00:01:30.710> good<00:01:31.070> luck

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
manage I'm sure you will so good luck

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:48.770 
manage I'm sure you will so good luck
see<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.520> later

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.760 

Detlef<00:01:49.780> now<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.200> you've<00:01:50.350> finished<00:01:50.560> the

Detlef now that you've finished the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.500 
Detlef now that you've finished the
performance<00:01:51.280> measurement<00:01:51.610> analysis<00:01:52.240> what's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
performance measurement analysis what's

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.630 
performance measurement analysis what's
the<00:01:52.659> result<00:01:52.990> we've<00:01:53.350> gained<00:01:53.590> 28<00:01:54.100> horsepower

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
the result we've gained 28 horsepower

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.690 

sounds<00:02:05.740> pretty<00:02:05.920> good<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.369> there<00:02:06.520> room<00:02:06.640> for

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
sounds pretty good is there room for

sounds pretty good is there room for
more<00:02:07.060> would<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.600> possible<00:02:09.149> sure<00:02:10.149> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
more would it be possible sure that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.790 
more would it be possible sure that
would<00:02:10.569> be<00:02:10.600> possible<00:02:11.050> but<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.380> care<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> lot

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
would be possible but we care a lot

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.250 
would be possible but we care a lot
about<00:02:11.860> durability<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.750> performance

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
about durability so this performance

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.559 
about durability so this performance
increase<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.890> more<00:02:15.130> than<00:02:15.280> enough<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.819> 1.6

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
increase is more than enough for a 1.6
