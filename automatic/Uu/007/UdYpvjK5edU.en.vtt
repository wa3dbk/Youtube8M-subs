00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.549
 alternative river turbines for the 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.709
 national electricity generation e 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.510
 interconnected from colombia these 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.400
 tests were performed in the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.100
 Unitary operations laboratory 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.750
 the university of antioquia which 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.579
 It has a water channel in which 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.289
 performed the simulation for the 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.939
 channel operation you have a 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.470
 pump that recirculates the water from a 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.470
 underground tank towards the canal 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.460
 we can see how in the channel 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.090
 water circulates the water stream 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 similar to what happens in a river 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 through the valve shown is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.560
 controls the amount of water that arrives 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.560
 to the channel 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.410
 for that case we take two flows one 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.180
 with a slow speed and another with a 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.100
 intermediate speed to see from a 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.470
 totally different result in the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.450
 behavior of the turbines 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.720
 If the channel has dimensions of 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.760
 known length and width can be 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.830
 easily measure the wet area of ​​this 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.940
 and with a floating element is in between 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.940
 the speed of the fluid 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.360
 easily calculating the flow rate we can 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.390
 see at that time how we launch the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 ball to find the speed and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 with the area can find the flow 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.350
 here I was given the time it took in 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.799
 travel a certain length the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.799
 ball 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.330
 how this work looks for its application to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.670
 the reality we can see similarity between 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.520
 the behavior of a river for example 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 the Orinoco River and what is shown in the canal 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.850
 that could be an equatorial region hoist 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.640
 located some turbine prototype 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.050
 the turbine type propeller was the first 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.600
 to prove 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.090
 as the turbine is observed completely 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.470
 submerged has rotation what it indicates 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.470
 that takes advantage of the current of the river 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.560
 the test was performed 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.470
 totally submerged and also I was 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.930
 submerged taking the amperage data 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.940
 of voltage to later calculate 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.660
 the electrical power generated in each 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660
 one of the cases 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.600
 for the readings a 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.600
 Multimeter 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.360
 adapted to the motor or generator in this 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.230
 case and take the readings that you 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.230
 presented in it 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.290
 the moments we have come to 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.100
 solve for a low speed e 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.100
 intermediate 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.550
 Now we can see the operation of 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.790
 this same turbine for a speed 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.790
 higher 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.790
 I am a test with the hydraulic wheel 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.210
 for a low speed the rotation is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.910
 almost zero 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.580
 while a flow velocity more 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.210
 high you get a better production of 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.210
 power 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.820
 for the case of the hydraulic wheel 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.400
 when it is totally submerged it is very 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.010
 inefficient because it generates very little 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.080
 electrical power in this graph 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.450
 we can observe the power the two 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.100
 turbines for a low speed and with 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.260
 partial partial turbines and 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.030
 completely submerged in which 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
 clearly notes that the turbine itself 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.700
 which is the one that has a greater 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.700
 power production 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.940
 this is due to the aerodynamic shape of 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.110
 the blades that allow to take better advantage 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.110
 the curve and up 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.460
 already in this graph we have a greater 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.919
 speed of flow partial turbines 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.110
 and completely submerged is observed 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.090
 clearly that the radio from Órica was the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.500
 which showed a higher production of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.539
 power when he was 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.340
 partially submerged however the 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.840
 turbine type propeller completely 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.729
 submerged it yielded a production of 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.800
 power greater than that of the wheel 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.539
 hydraulic now we look at the graph the 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.630
 turbine alice type with different 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.190
 degrees of inclination 0 and 30 degrees 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.780
 completely his energy is evident that 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.100
 for the zero degree tilt with 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.849
 the two channels the production of 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.279
 power was higher 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.319
 In conclusion we can notice that the 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:05.050
 turbine type helix in the best option 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.149
 to take it in the rivers of Colombia to 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.249
 real scale you could have a 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:12.279
 rural performance that can generate 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:16.319
 energy to supply homes homes 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.319
 in rural areas of color
