00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
claws and it's very easy it's just a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.020 
claws and it's very easy it's just a
twist<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.579> twist<00:00:35.880> it

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
and you start from the back and you chew

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.009 
and you start from the back and you chew
all<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.069> way<00:03:52.160> up<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.389> it's<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:53.989> a

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
all the way up and you can it's like a

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.199 
all the way up and you can it's like a
little<00:03:54.199> lobster<00:03:55.040> popsicle<00:03:55.639> you<00:03:55.669> can<00:03:55.940> kind<00:03:56.150> of

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
little lobster popsicle you can kind of

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.569 
little lobster popsicle you can kind of
eat<00:03:56.629> it<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:56.930> way<00:03:57.079> now<00:03:57.650> probably<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.220> most

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
eat it that way now probably the most

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.110 
eat it that way now probably the most
difficult<00:03:59.060> part<00:03:59.629> is<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.280> knuckles<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.519> for

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
difficult part is the knuckles and for

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.629 
difficult part is the knuckles and for
many<00:04:02.269> lobster<00:04:02.750> levels<00:04:03.109> lovers<00:04:03.680> this<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.370> an

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
many lobster levels lovers this is an

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.309 
many lobster levels lovers this is an
area<00:04:04.909> and<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.569> part<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.019> lobster

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
area and this is the part of the lobster

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.960 
area and this is the part of the lobster
that<00:04:06.470> they<00:04:06.590> enjoy<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:06.980> most<00:04:07.159> other<00:04:07.549> knuckles

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
that they enjoy the most other knuckles

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.909 
that they enjoy the most other knuckles
I<00:04:08.150> think<00:04:08.720> they<00:04:08.810> enjoyed<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.560> most<00:04:09.769> because

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
I think they enjoyed it the most because

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.309 
I think they enjoyed it the most because
it's<00:04:10.159> probably<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.489> hardest<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:10.909> get<00:04:11.060> out<00:04:11.319> and

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
it's probably the hardest to get out and

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.689 
it's probably the hardest to get out and
what<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.560> want<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.829> do<00:04:12.919> is<00:04:13.069> just<00:04:13.280> squeeze<00:04:13.459> it
