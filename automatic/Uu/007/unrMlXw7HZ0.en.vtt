00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
honestly doing it the difference is

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.680 
honestly doing it the difference is
sheer<00:01:31.330> speed<00:01:32.580> but<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:33.700> not<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.119> speed<00:01:34.450> that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690

let<00:01:58.630> me<00:01:58.689> make<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.840> more<00:01:58.990> difficult<00:01:59.170> well<00:01:59.829> I<00:01:59.860> can

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
let me make it more difficult well I can

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.719 
let me make it more difficult well I can
a<00:02:00.490> lot<00:02:01.450> more<00:02:01.689> difficult<00:02:02.170> how<00:02:03.009> about<00:02:03.280> using<00:02:03.520> the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
a lot more difficult how about using the

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.999 
a lot more difficult how about using the
tiny<00:02:04.060> reflection<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.990> diamond<00:02:05.439> ring<00:02:05.770> to

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
spot the target can't be done so check
