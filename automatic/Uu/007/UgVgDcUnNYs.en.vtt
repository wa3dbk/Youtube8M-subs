actually I think but you do want to get

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.800 
actually I think but you do want to get
the<00:01:13.939> inflatable<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.509> deflate

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the inflatable and so you can deflate

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.910 
the inflatable and so you can deflate
those<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.650> completely

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
those because if they are completely

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.440
