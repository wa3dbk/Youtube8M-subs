kelly to get in the space but you know
when<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.360> come<00:00:48.539> off<00:00:49.489> difficult<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:51.390> just

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
when he come off difficult so we just

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.939

want to get the boy little bit wider a
bit<00:00:53.160> earlier<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.960> i<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
bit earlier and i think that that was a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.819 
bit earlier and i think that that was a
catalyst<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> wind<00:00:57.449> obviously

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
catalyst really for the wind obviously

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
catalyst really for the wind obviously
we<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> players<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.609> can<00:01:00.180> produce

as you say second half sure what he

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.520 
as you say second half sure what he
shows<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.890> was<00:01:20.080> think<00:01:21.080> getting<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.409> boy<00:01:21.500> out

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
not sure I'm seen it so I couldn't

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.690 
not sure I'm seen it so I couldn't
really<00:01:32.600> comment<00:01:33.200> on<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.440> but<00:01:34.070> we<00:01:34.220> knew<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.399> he

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
really comment on it but we knew that he

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.680 
really comment on it but we knew that he
could<00:01:34.970> cause<00:01:35.690> some<00:01:35.960> problems<00:01:37.180> I'm<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.420> felt

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
could cause some problems I'm just felt

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.749 
could cause some problems I'm just felt
if<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:38.930> can<00:01:39.080> get<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.290> little<00:01:39.950> bit<00:01:40.220> early<00:01:40.399> so<00:01:40.610> he

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
if we can get a little bit early so he

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.789 
if we can get a little bit early so he
can<00:01:41.000> get<00:01:41.180> into<00:01:41.360> his<00:01:41.570> stride<00:01:41.960> this<00:01:42.290> was<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.500> thing

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
can get into his stride this was a thing

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.880 
can get into his stride this was a thing
and<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:44.180> know<00:01:44.330> I<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.350> second<00:01:45.740> goal

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and you know I think the second goal

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.830 
and you know I think the second goal
absolutely<00:01:46.580> top-drawer<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.149> really<00:01:47.600> really

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
absolutely top-drawer it really really

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.240 
absolutely top-drawer it really really
was<00:01:48.080> I<00:01:48.410> was<00:01:48.530> really<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.830> know<00:01:48.860> really<00:01:48.979> I
