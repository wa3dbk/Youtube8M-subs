00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.630

 here yours truly speaks and are well 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 welcome to crossfire once again 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.949
 A lot of people asked to make a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.529
 video of this little game that the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.050
 crossfire this is an old game 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 It's and I've already done a video for a while 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 behind some with some comparatives 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 among other games but finally 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.540
 well I want you to know that you 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 You know I'll tell you one more time when 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.870
 ask me to make video of some game 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.059
 do again to see the condition 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 of a game and such I will give my 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.469
 sincere opinion, I'm going to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 what a thing that everyone many people 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.329
 At least you already know that crossfire it does not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 is a very good game mainly 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.170
 visually, one can observe here the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.969
 He like the machine gun. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.489
 new on his hand to take a test 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.180
 the drive then this game is very 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.960
 poor neither visual and movement okay 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.979
 I'm going to buy a car here. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.870
 buy here but not only to see with the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.290
 different way 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.890
 I bought anta what would add bag 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:23.160
 traditional handbag left the deic pac 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.780
 there the 11 for whom I ana here led 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.250
 to support not only the senator who does not 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.540
 appear that he did not buy 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 I could not buy it either. 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.180
 A second hand has money, you 're the one. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.780
 next I go I go look for the map 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.430
 here access map fast then I have 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.090
 I 'll go back then, I'll just stick a finger. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.010
 recording and it's still here it's ok 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 lots of people coming back here 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.760
 Wow, I got on the map that this map 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.320
 at least I did not have the time I played 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.000
 this game 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 the first time what happened because 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.770
 I played this game and got to know him 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.400
 It's a good time ago when they fought 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.230
 left us here the galera street is a station 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.740
 Facial so I guess I type rangers 3 in 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.010
 Basements here look how wonderful this is 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.140
 people that thing of the future look at that thing 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:19.680
 It's sensational that our Vixe Maria 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.900
 There the guy is flying a good one so I found 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.700
 I played this game here and I played it 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.709
 Because I was looking for games to play. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.180
 in place of the combat arms is not to take the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.610
 Fight years, Brazil, and such. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.200
 I found it crossfire and played for a while 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.660
 huh 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.970
 So I ended up looking for other games and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.760
 I ended up being interested in other games 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 because people crossfire it's a game 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.500
 too much blood is an advantage that he 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000
 has to be a rather lightweight game and not 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.040
 favored the game leads you can 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.900
 to run on any computer or 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.870
 very simple content runs it 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
 one thing is that it is so light that here 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.230
 on my good machine I think if I 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.150
 leave it open and working I 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.910
 I can not open two blackbox 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.040
 if you mark to indemnify a video and the cross 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.670
 does not tickle the system is very 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.500
 Take this old game too he is 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.050
 very good in some ways 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.160
 because I did not think intimate is visually 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.320
 people 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.710
 he is very simple graphic he is very 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.440
 Bad is his drive harmony. 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.440
 It is very weak also the game he 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.140
 has a very poor visual appearance 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.670
 It's in the old game, fuck it. 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.040
 there are old games that 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.040
 visual aspect even older than him 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.020
 presents a much better visual appearance 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.670
 okay so the fact of it being a one game 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.740
 little old is no excuse 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.960
 which is one that is somewhat attractive in this 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.350
 game gameplay lytham 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.730
 cool gameplay so it is that 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.410
 depending on the map that a person 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.560
 Strange but we have maps that's cool. 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.780
 You have is the bulb plant pump type. 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.910
 netnet getnet then the gameplay 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.650
 liked and nice to play gameplay 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.900
 his strong point is well 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.540
 attractive you have a good reading of 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.160
 game you understand so it's cool, zinho 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.560
 is happening and is not a game ever 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.760
 A lot of cattle he has not been much. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.530
 bug nene and its mechanics so this does 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.390
 with which the staff even likes a little 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.390
 here the business does not have 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.550
 apologies 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.769
 of the people but it is necessary to emphasize 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.590
 again it is not because you like 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.930
 see this game here that it will be a 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.270
 extraordinary game is not a game that 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.210
 is a cool mechanic is a game 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.250
 well fun but it's just he asks in 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.250
 various aspects of life including myself 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.020
 I joined a new update, and you have 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.180
 up to 11 have legal 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.520
 buy it and such and such a game has 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.080
 feature a whole game 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520
 free online 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.140
 he has the items that we can 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.280
 buy with game money and items 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.930
 that we can buy with money from 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.060
 basic truth, right? 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.990
 and it 's good that more than I can be 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.840
 talking about him 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.060
 I love his followers a good list of 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.550
 no problem with me you do not have 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.890
 guitar works cool little one negative 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.690
 I think I found it very focused. 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.760
 He is very hacker again. 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.130
 I played this game here. 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.660
 radio even means you should have 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.390
 but I do not remember having a fast boat or 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.960
 Other good this second time I 'm 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.610
 playing this game is kind in the mouth one 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.979
 face that has the dick face to ask for 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.050
 downloading time by injecting a game rack 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.640
 highlight my I think the team the guy 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.680
 who dares to pay a motel for 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.820
 carrying an old goat is a guy who does not 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.340
 came 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.540
 the group I think the guy will lose 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.640
 time and motherfucker will be the 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.220
 enough to play eject a rack in a 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.860
 game to play online with power power 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.440
 pilot that is not the radio function of a 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.790
 son of a bitch hacker that he finds 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.600
 that he was something in the life of the 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.220
 other right 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.190
 using the radio in online matches then 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.770
 my why man this game the guy should 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.680
 use fast in the game 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.880
 is a mode will not make a recall of 2 not 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.830
 completed encouraging 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.120
 completely against it, everything here is 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.280
 for me a great quake motherfucker 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.810
 But your head's a very expensive face. 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.889
 who has the chutzpah to lose time 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.469
 tango rock in the game 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.449
 twice here my the guy is the kind of 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:06.639
 Pricey motel that pays to take the 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.999
 cable the old on good 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:12.879
 But anyway, people do not have much to do 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.319
 Speaking of this game here, I'm not going 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.319
 keep playing this game here mine 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.580
 Nick does not think it is, it 's no good. 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.289
 You ask me, I'll keep playing. 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.439
 I will not continue playing this game here 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.300
 I found it is in him, so I'm making a 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.729
 video here for you as you 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.819
 asked and all in my honest opinion 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.560
 about this game here he is with him has 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.050
 a bad look is simple 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.550
 it was an ugly game visually it has a 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.310
 harmony and a lot of movement 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.550
 Bad is his drive is very ugly. 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.590
 there is also the accusation that he would have 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.110
 shame of parents cool 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.650
 variety is cool then ok 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.009
 but it's a very simple game there 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.259
 Visually very bad but it's okay 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.749
 fun and has a gameplay until 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:02.110
 and a black screen that I can not 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:08.500
 I can tell you why I black screen 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:13.029
 and silly gogo 123 back 123 back to 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.339
 It's a good paper, we started it, but that's okay. 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:17.770
 with people is that ok 

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:19.779
 Congratulations, you were promoted to recruit. 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.370
 Look, people just do not enjoy recruiting. 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.870
 wonderful 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.270
 I will not continue playing this game 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.960
 here's good, this is what I had for 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.789
 to say of this game here I will close 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.080
 video here I'll leave it to you until 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:34.080
