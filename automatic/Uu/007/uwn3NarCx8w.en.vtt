00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:14.620
 a stove in a tent here is a smoke pipe 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:28.570
 This here is a thermocouple which should not 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:38.980
 let it burn tents it does not heat up 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:44.910
 that is, the pipe is hot, but since I myself am 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:50.610
 oven with a fully open blew 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.610
 firewood raw alma steam 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:07.299
 here in the tent 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:10.770
 warmer than outside this here for 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.390
 close or open 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:21.549
 exhorter reduces the flow of oxygen in 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:25.770
 firebox thermocover and allow not to burn and 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.770

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.020
 lightning now I did not think when 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.109
 installed the pipe so even out of two 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.479
 parties to be both will generally close 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:53.789
 on both sides the stove is cool to me 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:58.479

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.049
