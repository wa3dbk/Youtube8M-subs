by going down this route and this is
where<00:00:33.300> we're<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.750> initially<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
where we're going to take initially and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.770 
where we're going to take initially and
then<00:00:35.880> we're<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.059> head<00:00:36.210> towards<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> middle

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
then we're gonna head towards the middle

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.520 
then we're gonna head towards the middle
the<00:00:36.840> map<00:00:36.960> which<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.110> where<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> most

the map which is where the most

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
the map which is where the most
important<00:00:37.920> part<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> map<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.059> can

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
climb up the ladder here and it will

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
climb up the ladder here and it will
poke<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.700> hello<00:00:42.270> world<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.680> you

want<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.820> careful<00:00:45.180> though<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> climb

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
want to be careful though if you climb

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.760 
want to be careful though if you climb
up<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.170> people<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> top

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
up there and there are people at the top

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639 
up there and there are people at the top
and<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.030> easily<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.410> one

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and they can easily take you out and one

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.840 
and they can easily take you out and one
of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> spawn<00:00:50.070> points<00:00:50.370> where<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> started<00:00:50.730> off

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of the spawn points where I started off

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
of the spawn points where I started off
of<00:00:50.969> video<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.960> over<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.590> if

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
of video is just over there so if

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.020 
of video is just over there so if
they're<00:00:52.800> running<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> top<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> climb

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
they're running at the top and you climb

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
they're running at the top and you climb
up<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.780> could<00:00:54.960> easily<00:00:55.050> spot<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.920> take

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
up they could easily spot you and take

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
up they could easily spot you and take
you<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.809> wouldn't<00:00:57.960> recommend

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you out so I really wouldn't recommend

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
you out so I really wouldn't recommend
using<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.340> come<00:00:59.489> underground

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
using that at all just come underground

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
using that at all just come underground
and<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.989> most<00:01:01.559> important<00:01:01.980> part<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> map

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and this most important part of the map

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
and this most important part of the map
is<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.170> room<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.430> look

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
all the way down here and actually see

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
all the way down here and actually see
anyone<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.040> coming<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.049> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
anyone that's coming down and then you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
anyone that's coming down and then you
can<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.890> anybody<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.490> there

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
can actually see anybody that's there

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.719 
can actually see anybody that's there
there<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:13.590> come<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.340> check

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
there they can also come out and check

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.840 
there they can also come out and check
anybody<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.830> over<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.280> or

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
anybody that's up here or over there or

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.219 
anybody that's up here or over there or
over<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.689> another<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
over there because another one of the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960 
over there because another one of the
spawn<00:01:19.470> points<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.250> through<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
spawn points is just through there so

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.660 
spawn points is just through there so
this<00:01:21.869> room<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.590> pretty<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> ultimate

this room is pretty much the ultimate
room<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> whole<00:01:24.570> whole<00:01:25.350> map<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.130> it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
room of the whole whole map but it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
room of the whole whole map but it's
upstairs<00:01:26.580> part<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> also<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.720> important

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
upstairs part is also very important

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.550 
upstairs part is also very important
you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:30.390> room<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.079> nice<00:01:31.380> for

looking out over in that direction or
they<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.180> much<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> vantage<00:01:34.290> point

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
they don't have much of a vantage point
because<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.890> buildings<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> way<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because that buildings in the way it's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
because that buildings in the way it's
better<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.930> looking<00:01:37.110> across<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.680> when

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
better for looking across here when

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
better for looking across here when
people<00:01:37.890> spawn<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.140> shooting<00:01:40.140> inside<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
people spawn and shooting inside this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
people spawn and shooting inside this
building<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> didn't<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.850> across

building if you didn't want to go across

building if you didn't want to go across
this<00:01:42.390> way<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> actually<00:01:43.350> check<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.159> left

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
this way you can actually check the left

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.630 
this way you can actually check the left
hand<00:01:44.820> side<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.130> but<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.460> risky

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
hand side like so but it's a bit risky

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.800 
hand side like so but it's a bit risky
being<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.420> somebody<00:01:48.659> suddenly

you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.759> screwed<00:01:51.030> however<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.110> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you can be screwed however you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.490 
you can be screwed however you can
actually<00:01:52.710> close<00:01:53.549> both<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> doors<00:01:54.659> by

it<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.960> big<00:03:13.200> map<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.800> does<00:03:13.950> work<00:03:14.190> well

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
it is a big map so it does work well

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.850 
it is a big map so it does work well
however<00:03:14.820> if<00:03:15.210> you're<00:03:15.390> sniping<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.650> want<00:03:16.800> to

however if you're sniping you want to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
however if you're sniping you want to
make<00:03:16.980> sure<00:03:17.130> you've<00:03:17.250> got<00:03:17.280> somebody<00:03:17.700> else

like<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.660> map<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.020> think<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.440> good<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.910> can

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330

like this map I think it's good it can
be<00:03:54.450> quite<00:03:54.630> slow<00:03:54.840> paced<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:55.830> long<00:03:56.220> as

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
be quite slow paced but as long as

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.190 
be quite slow paced but as long as
you're<00:03:56.459> inside<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.480> know<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.870> enemies<00:03:58.110> are

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
you're inside you know the enemies are

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.600 
you're inside you know the enemies are
either<00:03:58.260> going<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.530> be<00:03:58.650> spawning<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.340> side

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
either going to be spawning on that side

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.000 
either going to be spawning on that side
