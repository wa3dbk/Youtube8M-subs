00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.690
 hey here is felipe amigo dark souls 2 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.660
 This time I'm going to teach is how to get a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 Shortcut to skip the gray map enough 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.620
 well you probably already noticed that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.080
 large hole in the middle of an area where 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 people love to jump to find out the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 that you have inside or probably you up to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 even one of them happens that in fact 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029
 It's quite simple the way you enter 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 in this hole just buy with the shell 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.619
 cone is one cat that sells items the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.570
 ring called igor setchin and costs 13 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 thousand souls is a ring that reduces its damage 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 for falls only relax is not yet the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.180
 enough you need to have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.399
 approximately one thousand hp points for 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.190
 survive the fall even using the ring 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 otherwise very rough late and much less 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.660
 effective find inpc is a seller 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.399
 of items well in front of a well 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.410
 advanced when talking to him will end 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.510
 and milk there you will pay three thousand and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.340
 500 souls for him to build a ladder there 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 in the hole for you just like I said it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 takes much more simple spends 13 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 thousand already buy the ring to use in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.989
 several other points in the game besides these 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 five in the first table is low if 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 cure to complete hp again and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 he kept jumping until he got 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.500
 entry here the entry of the anger map 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.729
 growing 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 soon face will have a bonfire 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.080
 rest and well this map is the home of 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.420
 one of the curves of the game in the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 frog broad shields the movement 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.600
 so in this case it aims to protect 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.340
 the map of invaders 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 if you are then very likely to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.270
 be invaded by at least one or two 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040
 times the chef's shirt besides having to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 killing a check is a relatively 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.360
 big if you want to skip all this 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.369
 process you can yes and direct to the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.170
 low manager map that is like talking 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 now coming back to the next hole 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 fire pit just below 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.560
 of your platform has another platform 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 the same size and downstairs another 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.939
 ironing board lived many try to fall on it 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.310
 even wearing the ring just does not work out for you 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.259
 And then I'll say I think 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090
 it was not optional that shortcut imagine that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.100
 this invitation with money traps 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.740
 for players to think that does not give 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.409
 only get along just as well at this very 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.840
 My point here is very carefully. 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.759
 seedlings that millimeter is your 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.320
 character team is almost falling like this 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.810
 can turn around and it will give a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.459
 distance from the basics, if you have 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.989
 sure it will fall on the platform of 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.910
 down I guess it was not 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.660
 supposed and stepped from there is just to continue 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.580
 falling to me 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.200
 an entrance and if they reach another point 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 open on a bridge with button in front 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.510
 and most of the unsuspecting ones fall here 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 focus of these in end up wasting time 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.470
 down here has a lot of zombie nem 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 those who jump on 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.580
 So you can not run here or not. 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.790
 matter the strategy you are going to use 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.590
 she will not give you the opposite use of 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.540
 distance damage weapons either one 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.080
 bow and arrow a beast a staff with 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.730
 more days 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.320
 I, for example, use binoculars to look 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.390
 with spells you can hit these 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.250
 not even a bug so you hit 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.380
 a punch yesterday everyone is going to stay here 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.880
 below can kill about 15 enemies 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.950
 to be able to fall safely in 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 There are still 2 left but this one can 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.250
 You can not even kill at a distance. 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.600
 careful one side keep an item 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.310
 the other side will continue down one 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.830
 map and well of all this and you will arrive 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.720
 of ganthier next to the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.550
 statues they have poison and 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.320
 you always see one of these can 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.270
 destroy with the beginning sword and hiss 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.920
 it will be totally dark it will not 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.990
 see no crap then with 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.490
 careful follow my steps and fall into this 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.200
 hole here where I can not be mistaken in 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.000
 The first time the ground will break and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 it's going to fall down it's good to be warned 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.900
 left full hp I imagine it should be 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.610
 very unpleasant to get down here and 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.709
 died in front of a fire but at last 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.330
 rest ac to be happy 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.490
 moreover for more players 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.440
 experienced tips have suggestions of 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.730
 interesting things might suggest the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.100
 comments maybe I make a video 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.450
 on short thank persisted 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.450
 worth value and until the next
