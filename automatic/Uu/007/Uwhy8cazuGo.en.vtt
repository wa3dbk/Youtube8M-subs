00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
light so with her I talked to him to go

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.040 
light so with her I talked to him to go
in<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.520> darker<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.690> fight

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in just a little bit darker to a fight

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.790 
in just a little bit darker to a fight
in<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.739> put<00:00:38.460> some<00:00:38.640> v<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.090> some<00:00:39.450> v<00:00:39.750> RB<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
in I put some v in some v RB which is a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.639 
in I put some v in some v RB which is a
red<00:00:41.040> brown<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:42.059> v<00:00:42.329> BG<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> brown

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
red brown and some v BG which is a brown

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.360 
red brown and some v BG which is a brown
gold<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.850> gives<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> some<00:00:46.129> warmth<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
gold so it just gives it some warmth in

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.330 
gold so it just gives it some warmth in
there<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.020> I've<00:00:49.020> mixed<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.070> used

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there and I've mixed this up and I used

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.080 
there and I've mixed this up and I used
20<00:00:50.789> volume<00:00:53.239> because<00:00:54.239> 20<00:00:54.539> volume<00:00:54.930> covers<00:00:55.350> great

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
20 volume because 20 volume covers great

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.279 
20 volume because 20 volume covers great
okay<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.539> gonna<00:00:57.660> start<00:00:57.989> hearing

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
okay so I'm just gonna start hearing

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
okay so I'm just gonna start hearing
inner<00:00:58.469> part<00:01:01.190> then<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.640> around

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
inner part then I'm going to go around

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.330 
inner part then I'm going to go around
her<00:01:03.180> hairline<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> why<00:01:07.500> am<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.680> talking<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
her hairline and why am I talking to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.890 
her hairline and why am I talking to
going<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.060> darker<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.600> first

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
going a little bit darker at first

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
going a little bit darker at first
she'll<00:01:10.650> probably<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> feels<00:01:11.610> really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
she'll probably think it feels really

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780 
she'll probably think it feels really
dark<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> her<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.750> she's<00:01:12.960> used<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.790> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
dark to her because she's used to this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.230 
dark to her because she's used to this
light<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.590> gonna<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.100> good<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
light but it's gonna look good when it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
light but it's gonna look good when it
fades<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> fades<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> little<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
fades because it fades a little bit and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
fades because it fades a little bit and
you<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:20.970> too<00:01:21.030> light<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.630> first

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you don't want to go too light at first

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
you don't want to go too light at first
because<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> fade<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.130> look

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
because when I fade that it's gonna look

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
because when I fade that it's gonna look
really<00:01:23.520> dull<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.030> my<00:01:27.420> own

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
really dull and so that's just my own

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
really dull and so that's just my own
opinion<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.590> how<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> like

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
to do it so we're gonna go with a 5 in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.480
