00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
pretty well built and this portion here

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.330 
pretty well built and this portion here
really<00:01:12.060> wasn't<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.659> secure<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.190> my

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
really wasn't very secure so I got my

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.450 
really wasn't very secure so I got my
own<00:01:14.490> screw<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.940> washer<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:16.460> secured

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
own screw and washer and just secured

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.289 
own screw and washer and just secured
there<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.360> move<00:01:18.600> around<00:01:20.299> so

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
there so it will move around so

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.090 
there so it will move around so
basically<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.260> do<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> yourself<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
basically you can do it yourself and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.060 
basically you can do it yourself and

uh<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:23.010> guess<00:02:23.640> sufficient<00:02:24.180> for<00:02:24.390> any<00:02:24.569> camera

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
uh I guess sufficient for any camera

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.819 
uh I guess sufficient for any camera
size<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.510> iPhone<00:02:27.900> 6<00:02:27.930> plus<00:02:28.439> which<00:02:28.799> is

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
size but for the iPhone 6 plus which is

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.690 
size but for the iPhone 6 plus which is
pretty<00:02:29.250> light<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.560> sticking<00:02:32.069> with<00:02:32.280> two

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
pretty light I'm just sticking with two

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.449 
pretty light I'm just sticking with two
weights<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.590> tree<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.769> bit<00:02:35.010> too<00:02:35.219> heavy

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
weights because tree is a bit too heavy

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.970 
weights because tree is a bit too heavy
on<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.819> bottom<00:02:35.959> so<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.140> reducing<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.769> two

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
on the bottom so I'm reducing the two

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.770 
on the bottom so I'm reducing the two
weights<00:02:38.189> which<00:02:38.430> seems<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.909> be<00:02:39.120> perfect<00:02:39.599> for

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
weights which seems to be perfect for

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.520 
weights which seems to be perfect for
the<00:02:39.900> iPhone<00:02:40.200> 6<00:02:40.230> plus<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:41.569> any<00:02:42.569> light<00:02:42.959> cameras

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the iPhone 6 plus or any light cameras

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.550 
the iPhone 6 plus or any light cameras
that<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.859> may<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.189> so<00:02:45.139> this<00:02:46.139> is<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.439> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
that you may have so this is what it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.470 
that you may have so this is what it
looks<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.430> how<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.609> suppose<00:02:48.000> hold<00:02:48.269> it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
looks like this is how I suppose hold it

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.970 
looks like this is how I suppose hold it
and<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.379> is<00:02:49.590> supposed<00:02:50.189> to<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:51.560> flimsy<00:02:52.560> like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
and it is supposed to be flimsy like

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.720 
and it is supposed to be flimsy like
that<00:02:53.189> it<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.489> move<00:02:53.670> from<00:02:53.849> side<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.090> side<00:02:54.180> and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that it can move from side to side and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.849 
that it can move from side to side and
forward<00:02:56.730> backwards<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.319> adjust<00:03:01.769> to

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
forward backwards so so we can adjust to

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.319 
forward backwards so so we can adjust to
your<00:03:02.099> movement<00:03:02.489> when<00:03:02.609> you're<00:03:02.669> walking<00:03:02.909> or

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
your movement when you're walking or

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.920 
your movement when you're walking or
running<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.439> this<00:03:05.159> is<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> sidekick

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
running so this is the sidekick

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.809 
running so this is the sidekick
I<00:03:07.909> guess<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.209> replicas<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.109> this<00:03:10.639> because<00:03:11.639> it

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
I guess the replicas of this because it

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.440 
I guess the replicas of this because it
is<00:03:12.209> anyway<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.319> piece<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.560> plastic<00:03:14.450> feels

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
is anyway just a piece of plastic feels

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.009 
is anyway just a piece of plastic feels
a<00:03:15.569> bit<00:03:15.689> rubbery<00:03:16.019> oh<00:03:17.329> that's<00:03:18.329> how<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.659> spelled

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
a bit rubbery oh that's how it's spelled

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.319 
a bit rubbery oh that's how it's spelled
without<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.530> cane<00:03:19.739> at<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:19.950> back<00:03:20.340> although

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
without the cane at the back although

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.099 
without the cane at the back although
still<00:03:22.019> gonna<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> groove<00:03:23.129> or<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:24.150> screw<00:03:24.510> to

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
still gonna go to a groove or a screw to

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.800 
still gonna go to a groove or a screw to
the<00:03:25.260> champ<00:03:25.590> stabilizer<00:03:26.129> so<00:03:28.940> basically<00:03:29.940> when

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the champ stabilizer so basically when

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.280 
the champ stabilizer so basically when
you<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:31.349> get<00:03:31.620> started<00:03:32.250> using<00:03:33.290> ECAM

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
you just get started using ECAM

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.399 
you just get started using ECAM
stabilizer<00:03:34.919> for<00:03:35.340> different<00:03:36.019> cameras<00:03:37.019> or

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
stabilizer for different cameras or

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.689 
stabilizer for different cameras or
different<00:03:38.280> phones<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:40.500> will<00:03:40.829> need<00:03:41.099> some<00:03:41.459> time

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
different phones you will need some time

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.629 
different phones you will need some time
to<00:03:41.909> get<00:03:42.060> adjusted<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.870> need<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.829> find<00:03:44.069> an<00:03:44.190> exact

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
to get adjusted to need to find an exact

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.800 
to get adjusted to need to find an exact
spot<00:03:45.049> because<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.319> sidekick<00:03:47.159> is<00:03:47.340> actually<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
spot because the sidekick is actually to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.009 
spot because the sidekick is actually to
one<00:03:49.079> side<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.620> right<00:03:49.829> side<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.989> a

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
one side to the right side so it is a

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.199 
one side to the right side so it is a
bit<00:03:52.290> heavier<00:03:52.889> on<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.250> right<00:03:53.519> side<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.120> you

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
bit heavier on the right side so you

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.969 
bit heavier on the right side so you
need<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.510> adjust<00:03:54.599> it<00:03:55.019> maybe<00:03:55.260> more<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> left

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
need to adjust it maybe more to the left

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.000 
need to adjust it maybe more to the left
to<00:03:56.549> even<00:03:56.879> out<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> weight<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.829> isn't

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
to even out the weight so that it isn't

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.550 
to even out the weight so that it isn't
swinging<00:03:59.790> more<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.239> right<00:04:00.419> or<00:04:00.690> more<00:04:01.379> to

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
swinging more to the right or more to

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.349 
swinging more to the right or more to
the<00:04:01.620> left<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.859> if<00:04:04.859> you<00:04:04.889> are<00:04:05.250> using<00:04:05.549> multiple

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
the left and if you are using multiple

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.080 
the left and if you are using multiple
devices<00:04:06.930> on<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.500> cam<00:04:08.159> stabilizer<00:04:08.669> you<00:04:08.849> can

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
devices on this cam stabilizer you can

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.420 
devices on this cam stabilizer you can
actually<00:04:09.269> just<00:04:10.109> use<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.379> marker<00:04:10.949> and<00:04:11.189> stuff

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
actually just use a marker and stuff

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.089 
actually just use a marker and stuff
just<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.540> make<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> marking<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.560> each<00:04:13.769> each

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
just to make a marking for each each

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.189 
just to make a marking for each each
device<00:04:14.699> so<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.000> don't<00:04:15.359> have<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.780> troubleshoot

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
device so you don't have to troubleshoot

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.909 
device so you don't have to troubleshoot
every<00:04:17.130> time<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.549> set<00:04:17.789> up<00:04:17.909> a<00:04:18.329> new<00:04:19.229> device<00:04:19.259> on

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
every time you set up a new device on

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.670 
every time you set up a new device on
your<00:04:20.099> cam<00:04:20.489> stabilizer<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.380> what<00:04:22.560> it's

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
your cam stabilizer so this is what it's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.520 
your cam stabilizer so this is what it's
supposed<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:23.070> look<00:04:23.250> like<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.780> sidekick<00:04:25.380> I

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
supposed to look like the sidekick I

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.839 
supposed to look like the sidekick I
guess<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.979> pretty<00:04:27.200> safe<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.529> my<00:04:29.130> phone<00:04:29.370> my

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
guess is pretty safe in my phone my

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.230 
guess is pretty safe in my phone my
iPhone<00:04:30.270> has<00:04:30.560> fallen<00:04:31.560> off<00:04:31.770> once

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
iPhone has fallen off once

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.260 
iPhone has fallen off once
while<00:04:34.169> using<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> sidekick<00:04:35.070> because<00:04:35.789> you<00:04:36.120> can

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
while using the sidekick because you can

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.830 
while using the sidekick because you can
see<00:04:36.449> there's<00:04:36.660> only<00:04:36.780> sliding<00:04:37.440> in<00:04:37.620> it's<00:04:37.830> not

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
see there's only sliding in it's not

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.990 
see there's only sliding in it's not
like<00:04:39.840> locked<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:40.979> or<00:04:41.190> something<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.820> it

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
like locked in or something like that it

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.469 
like locked in or something like that it
is<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.539> sliding<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.770> if<00:04:43.979> you<00:04:44.100> turn<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.789> X

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
is just sliding so if you turn the X

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.300 
is just sliding so if you turn the X
link<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.050> cam<00:04:46.229> stabilizer<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.100> left

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
link to the cam stabilizer to the left

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
link to the cam stabilizer to the left
it<00:04:48.000> might<00:04:48.240> slip<00:04:48.539> out<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:50.000> because<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.120> doesn't

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
it might slip out and because it doesn't

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.080 
it might slip out and because it doesn't
work<00:04:51.660> with<00:04:51.930> any<00:04:53.240> iPhone<00:04:54.240> cases<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.139> covers<00:04:55.590> so

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
work with any iPhone cases so covers so

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.850 
work with any iPhone cases so covers so
if<00:04:57.090> your<00:04:57.360> iPhone<00:04:57.750> falls<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.530> floor<00:04:58.710> I

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
if your iPhone falls on the floor I

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.730 
if your iPhone falls on the floor I
guess<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.550> would<00:04:59.729> be<00:04:59.880> pretty<00:05:00.180> painful<00:05:00.740> so

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
guess that would be pretty painful so

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.770 
guess that would be pretty painful so
just<00:05:02.280> showing<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:03.500> how<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:05.849> cam<00:05:06.240> stabilizer

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
just showing you how the cam stabilizer

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.110 
just showing you how the cam stabilizer
is<00:05:07.139> when<00:05:07.380> you're<00:05:07.590> walking<00:05:07.800> around<00:05:08.099> you<00:05:08.970> can

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
is when you're walking around you can

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120 
is when you're walking around you can
see<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.599> tilting<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.500> little<00:05:10.530> bit<00:05:10.979> to

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
see that it is tilting a little bit to

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.520 
see that it is tilting a little bit to
the<00:05:11.250> right<00:05:11.419> because<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:12.599> did<00:05:12.750> not<00:05:12.840> adjust<00:05:13.259> it

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
the right because I did not adjust it

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.960 
the right because I did not adjust it
properly<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:16.220> later<00:05:17.220> on<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.639> can<00:05:17.759> actually

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
properly so later on you can actually

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.450 
properly so later on you can actually
adjust<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.630> more<00:05:18.870> maybe<00:05:19.650> two<00:05:19.949> more<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.370> the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
adjust it more maybe two more to the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.839 
adjust it more maybe two more to the
middle<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.919> camp<00:05:22.919> stabilizer<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.639> can

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
middle of the camp stabilizer you can

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.140 
middle of the camp stabilizer you can
actually<00:05:24.000> shift<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.630> screw<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:26.000> here<00:05:27.000> is<00:05:27.120> a

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
actually shift the screw and here is a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.610 
actually shift the screw and here is a
video<00:05:27.539> which<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.139> took<00:05:30.080> using<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.199> iPhone

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
video which I took using the iPhone

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.710 
video which I took using the iPhone
six-plus<00:05:32.160> on<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.610> sidekick<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.389> cam

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
six-plus on the sidekick and cam

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.279 
six-plus on the sidekick and cam
stabilizer<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:35.660> can<00:05:36.660> see<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.990> is<00:05:37.139> pretty

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
stabilizer you can see that is pretty

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.860 
stabilizer you can see that is pretty
pretty<00:05:37.949> nice<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.460> watch<00:05:38.699> it<00:05:39.389> doesn't<00:05:39.720> bounce

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
pretty nice to watch it doesn't bounce

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.219 
pretty nice to watch it doesn't bounce
around<00:05:40.190> like<00:05:41.190> if<00:05:41.970> you're<00:05:42.240> not<00:05:42.449> using<00:05:42.750> unless

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
around like if you're not using unless

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.520 
around like if you're not using unless
you<00:05:43.440> do<00:05:43.620> have<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:43.919> pretty<00:05:44.479> steady<00:05:45.479> hand<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.229> if

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
you do have a pretty steady hand and if

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.800 
you do have a pretty steady hand and if
you<00:05:46.860> know<00:05:47.159> how<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.340> walk<00:05:47.760> lightly<00:05:48.360> or<00:05:48.539> run

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
you know how to walk lightly or run

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.029 
you know how to walk lightly or run
lightly<00:05:50.150> if<00:05:51.150> not<00:05:51.539> then<00:05:52.139> this<00:05:52.710> would<00:05:52.889> be<00:05:53.010> a

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
lightly if not then this would be a

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.500 
lightly if not then this would be a
pretty<00:05:53.430> good<00:05:54.199> option<00:05:55.199> to<00:05:55.680> buy<00:05:56.360> make<00:05:57.360> your

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
pretty good option to buy make your

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
videos nicer and this is one of my

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.730 
videos nicer and this is one of my
videos<00:06:02.280> running<00:06:02.729> on<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:03.000> beach<00:06:03.180> in<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.139> water

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
videos running on the beach in the water

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.570 
videos running on the beach in the water
on<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.039> sand<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:06.560> you<00:06:07.560> can<00:06:07.710> see<00:06:07.860> it<00:06:08.039> is<00:06:08.190> pretty

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
on the sand so you can see it is pretty

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.210 
on the sand so you can see it is pretty
pretty<00:06:09.419> alright<00:06:09.840> it's<00:06:10.110> not<00:06:10.259> perfect<00:06:11.009> or

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
pretty alright it's not perfect or

pretty alright it's not perfect or
anything<00:06:11.370> like<00:06:11.580> that

anything like that

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.390 
anything like that

better ones

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.200 
better ones
