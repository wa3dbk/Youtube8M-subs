just be a blank screen on your TV or
your<00:00:15.210> monitor<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.800> put<00:00:17.100> your<00:00:17.279> garter

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
your monitor when you put your garter

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.710 
your monitor when you put your garter
and<00:00:18.060> your<00:00:18.150> ps3<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.960> now<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and your ps3 in now this is because the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
and your ps3 in now this is because the
image<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.310> olgas<00:00:23.580> end<00:00:23.910> into<00:00:24.210> your

monitor is not supported by the monitor

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.769 
monitor is not supported by the monitor
which<00:00:26.789> means<00:00:27.029> obviously<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.420> monitors

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
which means obviously it's the monitors

up to 1080 I don't even know why it says
P<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.079> there<00:03:01.290> because<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.590> were<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:02.010> don't<00:03:02.400> think

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
P on there because it were I don't think

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.390

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
going through HDMI cable input so that's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
going through HDMI cable input so that's
a<00:03:08.879> bit<00:03:09.000> strange<00:03:09.299> but<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.540> found<00:03:09.870> personally

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
a bit strange but I found personally

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.910 
a bit strange but I found personally
when<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:11.549> in<00:03:11.670> 1080i<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.900> screen<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.709> didn't

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
when I put in 1080i the screen it didn't

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.190 
when I put in 1080i the screen it didn't
look<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.549> kind<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.450> kind<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.840> moved

look as good it kind of it kind of moved

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.020 
look as good it kind of it kind of moved
slightly<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.889> down<00:03:17.069> if<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.430> makes<00:03:17.639> sense

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
slightly up and down if that makes sense

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.569 
slightly up and down if that makes sense
it<00:03:18.329> was<00:03:18.480> really<00:03:18.750> strange<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.069> didn't<00:03:20.430> want

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
it was really strange but I didn't want

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.160 
it was really strange but I didn't want
it<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.670> 720p<00:03:21.299> anywhere<00:03:21.660> said<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.959> when<00:03:22.049> it

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
get a second here but you go into this

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.440 
get a second here but you go into this
it<00:03:29.730> says<00:03:30.239> input<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.840> output<00:03:31.230> 9<00:03:31.730> 1280<00:03:32.730> by<00:03:33.060> 720

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.870 
it says input and output 9 1280 by 720
which<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.019> 720p<00:03:34.530> obviously<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.310> then<00:03:35.700> your

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
which is 720p obviously and then your

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.339 
which is 720p obviously and then your
bitrate<00:03:36.209> everything's<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.019> there<00:03:37.200> which

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
bitrate everything's just there which

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.080 
bitrate everything's just there which
