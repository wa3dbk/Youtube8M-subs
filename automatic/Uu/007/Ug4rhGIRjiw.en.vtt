00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
here it's important to note that this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
here it's important to note that this
will<00:00:42.149> only<00:00:42.180> work<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:42.930> existing<00:00:43.050> hue

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
will only work with an existing hue

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
will only work with an existing hue
system<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> does<00:00:45.420> connect<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
system because it does connect to the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.779 
system because it does connect to the

same hue base station so you're going to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
same hue base station so you're going to
need<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.300> Philips<00:00:48.660> hue<00:00:48.780> starter<00:00:49.140> kit<00:00:49.320> in

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
cord that comes out of the front of this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.330 
cord that comes out of the front of this
thing<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.869> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.229> weird<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.829> power<00:01:56.070> cord

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
thing is kind of weird the power cord

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.639 
thing is kind of weird the power cord
actually<00:01:56.670> comes<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.020> may<00:01:58.439> consider

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
actually comes out what you may consider

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.219 
actually comes out what you may consider
the<00:01:59.189> front<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> lamp<00:02:00.210> which<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.810> basically

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the front of the lamp which is basically

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
the front of the lamp which is basically
the<00:02:01.409> direction<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> light<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.520> pointing

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the direction that the light is pointing

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.459 
the direction that the light is pointing
see<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> comes<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> front<00:02:04.229> there

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
see how it comes out of the front there

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.420 
see how it comes out of the front there
well<00:02:04.649> that's<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> actually

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
well that's because this is actually

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.300 
well that's because this is actually
meant<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> face<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.630> wall<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.129> keep

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
meant to face a wall so kind of keep

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.710 
meant to face a wall so kind of keep
that<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.550> mind<00:02:08.849> when<00:02:09.060> you're<00:02:09.209> looking<00:02:09.239> at<00:02:09.599> this

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that in mind when you're looking at this

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.570 
that in mind when you're looking at this
but<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.110> also<00:02:10.379> notice<00:02:10.679> there's<00:02:10.830> no<00:02:10.950> grip<00:02:11.370> around

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
but I also notice there's no grip around

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820 
but I also notice there's no grip around
the<00:02:11.940> edges<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.330> which<00:02:13.020> may<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.530> big

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the edges here which may not be a big

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
the edges here which may not be a big
deal<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.250> some<00:02:14.520> but<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.600> a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
deal to some but if you have it on a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.450 
deal to some but if you have it on a
desk<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.170> something<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.620> does<00:02:16.830> leave<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> kind

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
desk or something it does leave it kind

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.820 
desk or something it does leave it kind
of<00:02:17.580> prone<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.030> slide<00:02:18.330> around<00:02:18.480> though<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.590> lamp

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
of prone to slide around though the lamp

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.290 
of prone to slide around though the lamp
does<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.280> some<00:02:20.490> weight<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:21.090> well<00:02:21.270> so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
does have some weight to it as well so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.420 
does have some weight to it as well so
it's<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.050> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.320> slide<00:02:22.500> very<00:02:22.770> easily<00:02:23.040> but

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's not going to slide very easily but

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.520 
it's not going to slide very easily but
there<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.760> no<00:02:24.090> grip<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.870> bottom<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.500> let's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
there is no grip on the bottom so let's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.230 
there is no grip on the bottom so let's
go<00:02:25.770> ahead<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.100> plug<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.880> test<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
go ahead and plug this in and test it

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.640 
go ahead and plug this in and test it
out<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.990> can<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.350> through<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> camera

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650

and being used as an accent light and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.260 
and being used as an accent light and
here<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> iPhone<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> hue<00:02:39.060> app

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
here we have the iPhone with the hue app

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.940 
here we have the iPhone with the hue app
let's<00:02:39.840> go<00:02:39.960> ahead<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.230> fire<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.800> and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
let's go ahead and fire it up and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.210 
let's go ahead and fire it up and
connect<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.910> lamp<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.810> my<00:02:42.840> hue<00:02:43.290> system<00:02:43.770> so

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
connect this lamp to my hue system so

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.700 
connect this lamp to my hue system so
basically<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.270> want<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.660> go<00:02:46.050> back<00:02:46.230> into<00:02:46.500> that

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
the gear in the corner and then we want

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.500

the bottom tap on find my lights so it's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330 
the bottom tap on find my lights so it's
going<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.360> search<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.470> bloom<00:02:58.800> lamp<00:02:59.070> here
