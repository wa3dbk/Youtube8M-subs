00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
Xbox one it's a little tricky a little

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.210 
Xbox one it's a little tricky a little
trickier<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.140> way<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> found

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
trickier but this is a way that I found

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.790 
trickier but this is a way that I found
that<00:00:23.640> works<00:00:24.119> best<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.170> figured<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.769> would

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
that works best so I figured I would

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
that works best so I figured I would
share<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.609> guys<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.300> hope<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.990> enjoy
