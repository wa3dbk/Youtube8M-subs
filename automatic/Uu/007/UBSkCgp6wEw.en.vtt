00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.069
 hi youtube i'm pete seeger and 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.030
 welcome to the review of the elsa if 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.470
 alone around here 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.420
 remember that these videos are not for 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.889
 demonstrate skills but to see 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.389
 how the weapon works in the hands of a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.130
 mean boy like I am 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.690
 they are also here do not forget 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 comment with a weapon that they would like to see 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.060
 in the near future or if not the word 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 of the day that is found, let's start with the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.350
 review of airsoft light weight small 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.690
 arms technologies is a project carried out 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.460
 out by the us army for 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.920
 develop a metric platform 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.170
 light much lighter much more mobile 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 and having more or less the same 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.890
 durability and all the comforts that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.309
 they now have light machine guns 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.839
 It is manufactured mainly by ajai 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 corporation in the usa country the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.890
 first prototypes in operation 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.899
 are in production since 2010 the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.929
 ammunition that you use up to the moment of 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.019
 5.56 x 45 millimeters of NATO 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.879
 although it is planned to use the 7.62 in 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.489
 the future the rate of shots is 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.129
 identical to the game with 650 shots 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.479
 per minute already passed under 4 this weapon 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.250
 is unlocked once you 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.500
 reach 11,000 points with symmetry 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.070
 of the light ones made a damage model is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 Very simple 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 of the assault rifles only with a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 higher range that is to say it has a death of 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.010
 four shots to the chest with 25 points 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.410
 damage within the first 8 meters and 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
 if they go beyond 65 meters is a 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.909
 death in 6 shots with 18 points of damage 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 as for the ammunition you have a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.350
 disposition 100 bullets in the belt and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 as for that belt how fast 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 recharge are 5 points 9 seconds that stops 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.190
 100 bullets is a bit slow though 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.960
 very in the middle of what would be the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.729
 light machine guns do not forget 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.710
 get in coverage for you 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 can recharge without any problem the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 Cadence of shots from 650 shots 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 per minute and this is what complicate 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.410
 many times the fighting in medias 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.080
 distances or even short distances 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.060
 if they happen to find such a player 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.950
 close to the bullet speed that's very 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 good at 620 meters on second and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.960
 similar to assault rifles and this 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.050
 focuses rather on the range of certain 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.060
 distance little damage that this weapon has 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.220
 that we will see later the only 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 shooting mode being a light material 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.480
 it's just automatic recoil 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 here starts the good and so 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.740
 We can say that he has a certain 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.390
 range and some precision the kick towards 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.480
 up is point 25 to the left 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.060
 point 25 and to the right 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.800
 affirmatively point 25 and what has 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.750
 good is that in addition the multiplier of 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.630
 first shot is to say how strong 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.060
 kick the first bullet here is 1 is to say 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.860
 the first bullet as the last have the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.870
 same kick or the same amount of 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 kick for the same if you squeeze 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.100
 many times the trigger makes bursts 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 they go totally in automatic the pattern 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.330
 of shot that you have to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.490
 accustom is exactly the same as the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.640
 accuracy is point 3 similar to the 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.340
 carbines so to speak 4.5 from the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.650
 hip that although it's slightly better 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.870
 that some light machine guns is not 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.240
 nothing for anything that they would like to have from 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.790
 the hip so avoid at all costs 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.950
 face enemies too close by 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.170
 both cadence and skill 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.930
 to shoot from the hip in terms of 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.880
 pass it as the most objective weapon and here 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.560
 start the good because so far 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.410
 it is a weapon without a joke a weapon of low 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 cadence low damage good relative low 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.000
 hurt not many bullets then that does 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.430
 well the best 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.960
 to use the distance is not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.110
 too much where they have to deal 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.850
 always with the six shots but with 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.160
 five shots in the distance will be going 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.260
 pretty good in that range is where 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.530
 they must work and here's why 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.990
 first a view of 3.4 x is recommended 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.280
 or 4x and you like what you 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.200
 like in terms of the look but they 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.870
 I recommend that after that some 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.570
 angled that will make the multiplier 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.120
 the first shot still has been reduced 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.850
 and in this way the recoil in general 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.770
 also cut in half that way 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.540
 with that kick it's going to be the most 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.760
 controllable that you can find in everything 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.950
 the game with 100 bullets charger 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 then in the canyon I suggest that no 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.600
 put something or not if you already 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.030
 they ascend that kick very little they can 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.970
 control much more a heavy barrel for 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.590
 increase accuracy base after 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.390
 that can use a magnifier if 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.970
 I chose a holographic or 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.010
 red dot or if not a laser sight and 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.870
 remember to turn it off and only turn it on 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.240
 in case they are in close combat 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.580
 having already said that the way to use 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.250
 the best already specifically do 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.990
 small bursts of 1 to 2 shots is more 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.479
 if you can shoot as fast 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.439
 that can all the bullets but with click 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.939
 by bullet 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.349
 do it that way they're going to make 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.569
 with this configuration have a 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.460
 very controllable reverse dispersion 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.500
 do not go through the heavens and they're going to have 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.110
 the most accurate machine gun among 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.669
 all those and plus it's a plus if 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.280
 you manage to shoot in the head 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.280
 because with that they are definitely going to be 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.840
 the deadliest support players in 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.849
 Regarding the pros and cons points 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.009
 good and bad points of the weapon we have 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.500
 in terms of good points the stability 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.620
 It is amazing and very manageable in terms of 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.259
 you get a recharge that maybe does not stay 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.909
 very good as far as the charger is 100 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.009
 bullets we have for example the double vee 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.349
 I know it's an example of recharging more 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.270
 fast but if you are far away 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.280
 the enemy as it should be no 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.919
 They should have a lot of trouble and the most 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.349
 big against is the slow cadence that 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.139
 with such a low damage compared to 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.449
 other weapons of slow cadence do not have 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.979
 a time to kill very high so 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.719
 if you face an enemy that 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.250
 have skill that knows what is 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.700
 doing with a much older weapon 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.100
 cadence 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.080
 or even worse in circumstances where 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.910
 They are too close to the enemy as 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.200
 it is probable that they will lose for the same reason 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.150
 I will give a rating of two 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.950
 slices of pizza on four and the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.230
 why I do not give the 3 if it is 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.940
 touching the 3 is because even though it is 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.510
 very controllable and many people are leaving 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.550
 to accomodate with her that I guarantee 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.930
 totally not a competitive weapon not 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.850
 is a weapon that is on par with the 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.580
 better in the game and if you are 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:07.000
 going against a team that is full 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.130
 from m &amp; g 4 or saic to 971 and others as much 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.120
 likely to come out losing and without 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.950
 However, although it is very 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.380
 controllable and in normal games 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.780
 could take it well I did not find in 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.970
 any time I said or in this 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.220
 I would love to have a sap 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.010
 for sure it is the ideal weapon for this 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.930
 situation did not really think about any 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.520
 another carbine or some other shrapnel 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.350
 light that could make the 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.420
 work but as always the best 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.370
 are you and tell me what you think 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.080
 I hope the review has been informative 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.460
 and have you served them if it was like that please 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.200
 from the rating to the video that 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.700
 consider sharing the networks 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.590
 social networks facebook and twitter is in the 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.300
 registration and if they are not yet subscribed 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.840
 I highly recommend that you see the 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.040
 the rest 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.810
 that I have in the channel so that 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.810
 convince see you next time
