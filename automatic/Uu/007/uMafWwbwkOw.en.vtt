place its most likely taking place at
147<00:01:10.560> pounds<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:12.890> I'm<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.490> Danny

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
147 pounds and I'm going with Danny

147 pounds and I'm going with Danny
Garcia<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.400> he's<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
Garcia I just think that he's the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
Garcia I just think that he's the
tougher<00:01:18.000> smarter<00:01:18.479> stronger<00:01:18.869> fighter<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.320> mean

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
tougher smarter stronger fighter I mean

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
tougher smarter stronger fighter I mean
Marcos<00:01:20.490> Maidana<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.090> mean<00:01:21.330> when<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.630> comes<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Marcos Maidana I mean when it comes to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.359 
Marcos Maidana I mean when it comes to
power

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
power

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.090 
power
um<00:01:23.369> maybe<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.600> tip<00:01:24.960> towards<00:01:25.439> Marcos

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
um maybe I would tip towards Marcos

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.640 
um maybe I would tip towards Marcos
Maidana<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.210> Danny<00:01:27.390> Garcia<00:01:27.659> has<00:01:28.200> one

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
Maidana but I think Danny Garcia has one

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.969 
Maidana but I think Danny Garcia has one
hell<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> chin<00:01:29.430> man<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:29.850> his<00:01:30.090> chin<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
hell of a chin man I think his chin is

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
hell of a chin man I think his chin is
better<00:01:31.979> than<00:01:32.250> Marcos<00:01:32.610> Maidana<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.180> mean<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
better than Marcos Maidana is I mean I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880 
better than Marcos Maidana is I mean I
know<00:01:33.540> my<00:01:33.720> Chris<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.049> dad<00:01:34.200> has<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> tough<00:01:34.619> fighter

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
know my Chris my dad has a tough fighter

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
know my Chris my dad has a tough fighter
and<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:36.000> Danny<00:01:36.360> Garcia<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and all but I think Danny Garcia has a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
and all but I think Danny Garcia has a
great<00:01:37.290> chin<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.610> he's<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.420> he

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
great chin and I think he's I think he

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
great chin and I think he's I think he
can<00:01:39.840> take<00:01:40.020> Marcus<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.619> dance<00:01:40.799> punches<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
can take Marcus my dance punches and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.210 
can take Marcus my dance punches and
with<00:01:42.270> Danny<00:01:43.020> Garcia<00:01:43.229> being<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> smarter

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
with Danny Garcia being the smarter

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.030 
with Danny Garcia being the smarter
fighter<00:01:45.140> man<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.590> did<00:01:46.710> underestimate

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
fighter man I really did underestimate

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.120 
fighter man I really did underestimate
his<00:01:47.790> countering<00:01:48.479> abilities<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> his<00:01:49.740> boxing

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
his countering abilities and his boxing

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
his countering abilities and his boxing
abilities<00:01:50.549> before<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.479> mateesah<00:01:51.840> fight<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
abilities before the mateesah fight but

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.969 
abilities before the mateesah fight but
now<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.790> believe<00:01:54.450> him<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.020> believe<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.619> Danny

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
now I believe him and I believe in Danny

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
now I believe him and I believe in Danny
Garcia<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.329> feel<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.290> beat

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Garcia and I feel like he will beat

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.359 
Garcia and I feel like he will beat
Marcos<00:01:59.759> Maidana<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.500> maybe<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
Marcos Maidana and then maybe maybe it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.999 
Marcos Maidana and then maybe maybe it
could<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.670> close<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:04.229> close<00:02:04.469> fight<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
could be close in a close fight and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
could be close in a close fight and
competitive<00:02:05.549> fight<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.360> will

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
competitive fight but I think he will

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.139 
competitive fight but I think he will
beat<00:02:06.719> Marcos<00:02:07.079> Maidana<00:02:07.580> but<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> fight

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
beat Marcos Maidana but it's a fight

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
beat Marcos Maidana but it's a fight
