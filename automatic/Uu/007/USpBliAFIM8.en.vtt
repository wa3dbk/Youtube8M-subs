 attempts to change the course of events 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.520
 meaningless 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.640

 I wonder what you would become 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.990
 eventually 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.000
 mighty and merciless ideal 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:41.150
 killing machines 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.770
 or graceful and wise 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.960
 always angry at the world tearing the fabric of reality 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.869
 anyway 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 you change forever if you don't throw off 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.170
 flame of chaos 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.610
 but welcome to a new world where everyone 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.610
 capable of big
