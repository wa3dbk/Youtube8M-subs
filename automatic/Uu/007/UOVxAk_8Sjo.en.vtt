hello again and welcome back to Mario

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello again and welcome back to Mario
this<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.149> town<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:04.020> Croydon<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.400> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
this is town of Croydon and this is the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.200 
this is town of Croydon and this is the
Church<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> Croydon<00:00:06.660> now<00:00:07.790> I've<00:00:08.790> done<00:00:09.000> some

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
Church of Croydon now I've done some

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.870 
Church of Croydon now I've done some
research<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.750> lot<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> research<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.880> religion

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
research a lot of research on religion

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.170 
research a lot of research on religion
in<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> north<00:00:13.019> culture<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.210> this<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.480> is

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
in the north culture and this one is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.689 
in the north culture and this one is
called<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.449> stave<00:00:18.810> Church<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.949> basically<00:00:20.490> what

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
called a stave Church and basically what

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.710 
called a stave Church and basically what
that<00:00:20.730> means<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:22.769> take<00:00:22.850> big<00:00:23.850> giant

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
that means is they would take big giant

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.390 
that means is they would take big giant
sticks<00:00:25.170> which<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.560> essentially<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.189> tree

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
sticks which are essentially just tree

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
sticks which are essentially just tree
trunks<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.060> drive<00:00:27.330> them<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> ground

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
trunks and drive them into the ground

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.550 
trunks and drive them into the ground
and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.340> would<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:30.050> wooden<00:00:31.050> planks

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and then they would use wooden planks

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.900 
and then they would use wooden planks
now<00:00:31.710> these<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:32.070> technically<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
now these are technically going the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
now these are technically going the
wrong<00:00:33.059> way<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.450> should<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.809> vertical

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
wrong way they should be going vertical

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.119 
wrong way they should be going vertical
and<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> basically<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> whole<00:00:36.770> church<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and so basically the whole church is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
and so basically the whole church is
nothing<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.090> wood<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.410> would

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
nothing but wood and then they would

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.389 
nothing but wood and then they would
have<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:41.690> foundation<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> stone<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> ground

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
have a foundation of stone on the ground

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
have a foundation of stone on the ground
so<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> dirt<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.840> wood<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.200> come

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so that the dirt and the wood don't come

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.930 
so that the dirt and the wood don't come
in<00:00:46.559> contact<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:47.100> each<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> rot<00:00:47.789> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
in contact with each other and rot it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
in contact with each other and rot it
out<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:50.360> primarily<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.840> Nordic<00:00:52.440> religion

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
out and primarily the Nordic religion

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.389 
out and primarily the Nordic religion
would<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.190> pagan<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:56.309> remember

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
would be pagan and then I don't remember

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
would be pagan and then I don't remember
the<00:00:56.670> exact<00:00:57.059> date<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> want<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> say<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> was

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the exact date but I want to say it was

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.840 
the exact date but I want to say it was
sometime<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> 1400s<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.899> 1500s<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
sometime in the 1400s or 1500s the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.299 
sometime in the 1400s or 1500s the
Catholic<00:01:03.239> Church<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.619> starting<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
Catholic Church which was starting to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.320 
Catholic Church which was starting to
bring<00:01:05.430> Christianity<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.420> Norway<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> they

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
bring Christianity to Norway and so they

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
bring Christianity to Norway and so they
started<00:01:09.630> erecting<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.369> churches<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
started erecting these churches and I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.219 
started erecting these churches and I
guess<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:12.000> started<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.390> fairly<00:01:12.780> simple<00:01:13.080> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
guess they started out fairly simple is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.660 
guess they started out fairly simple is
this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.439> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.770> four<00:01:14.040> corner<00:01:14.520> posts

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this is kind of like four corner posts

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
this is kind of like four corner posts
and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.070> form

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and then they would go up and then form

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.810 
and then they would go up and then form
a<00:01:17.490> peak<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> roof<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:20.009> Norwegians<00:01:20.580> were

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a peak to a roof and the Norwegians were

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.510 
a peak to a roof and the Norwegians were
good<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.720> wood<00:01:21.930> building<00:01:22.409> ships<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.159> all

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
good with wood building ships and all

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.999 
good with wood building ships and all
those<00:01:23.670> kinds<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> things<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:25.350> were

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
those kinds of things and and they were

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.149 
those kinds of things and and they were
ornate<00:01:26.630> people<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.810> far<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.140> making<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.040> know

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
ornate people as far as making you know

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
ornate people as far as making you know
sculptures<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> things<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
sculptures and things like that out of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
sculptures and things like that out of
wood<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> they<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> more

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
wood so they would make more and more

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.240 
wood so they would make more and more
elaborate<00:01:33.869> churches<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
elaborate churches and this is kind of

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.679 
elaborate churches and this is kind of
somewhere<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.310> between<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.970> two<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
somewhere in between the two so this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
somewhere in between the two so this
would<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.990> probably<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.860> earlier<00:01:41.189> one

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
would be probably an earlier one

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
would be probably an earlier one
typically<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.810> much<00:01:43.170> taller<00:01:43.649> than

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
typically they would be much taller than

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.090 
typically they would be much taller than
this<00:01:44.070> steeper<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.259> they<00:01:46.259> would<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.860> lot

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this steeper and they would have a lot

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.090 
this steeper and they would have a lot
more<00:01:47.899> levels<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.200> different<00:01:49.619> rooms<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
more levels with different rooms and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.880 
more levels with different rooms and
things<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.689> I've<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
things like that and so I've kind of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
things like that and so I've kind of
combined<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.759> bigger<00:01:54.060> roof<00:01:54.450> right

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
combined like this bigger roof right

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.170 
combined like this bigger roof right
here<00:01:54.770> we'd<00:01:55.770> probably<00:01:56.159> broken<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.610> broken<00:01:56.850> up

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
here we'd probably broken up broken up

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.170 
here we'd probably broken up broken up
into<00:01:57.360> two<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
into two but I kind of like the way it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.969 
into two but I kind of like the way it
turned<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.229> mean<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> building

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
turned out and then I mean the building

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.910 
turned out and then I mean the building
looks<00:02:02.250> massive<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.590> not<00:02:04.590> as

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
looks massive but it's really not as

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
looks massive but it's really not as
large<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.119> looks

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
large as it looks

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.540 
large as it looks
it's<00:02:07.380> more

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.180 

kind<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.480> upper<00:02:11.780> levels<00:02:12.140> size<00:02:12.710> and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
kind of like this upper levels size and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.760 
kind of like this upper levels size and
then<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.670> lower<00:02:13.940> level<00:02:14.210> right<00:02:14.480> here<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.590> I'm

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
then this lower level right here and I'm

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.590 
then this lower level right here and I'm
gonna<00:02:15.950> butcher<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.550> term<00:02:16.850> but<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.090> think<00:02:17.390> I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
gonna butcher this term but I think I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.960 
gonna butcher this term but I think I
want<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> say<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:19.130> know<00:02:19.250> I'll<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.760> right

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
want to say it's you know I'll be right

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.570 
want to say it's you know I'll be right
back<00:02:20.150> I'm<00:02:20.360> gonna<00:02:20.450> go<00:02:20.600> look<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.900> up<00:02:21.430> okay<00:02:22.430> I'm

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
back I'm gonna go look it up okay I'm

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.020 
back I'm gonna go look it up okay I'm
back

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
back

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.440 
back
so<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.780> word<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.230> ambulatory<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.520> what<00:02:26.270> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
so the word is ambulatory and what that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.790 
so the word is ambulatory and what that
is<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:28.370> outer<00:02:28.700> wall<00:02:29.440> that's<00:02:30.440> built

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
is is this outer wall that's built

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.420 
is is this outer wall that's built
around<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.450> actual<00:02:32.840> building<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:34.190> is

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
around the actual building and this is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.090 
around the actual building and this is
just<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.180> further<00:02:35.570> prevent<00:02:35.960> weather<00:02:36.770> damage

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
just to further prevent weather damage

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.040 
just to further prevent weather damage
done<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.970> actual<00:02:38.270> building<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
done to the actual building so this is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.890 
done to the actual building so this is
something<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.380> they<00:02:39.650> would<00:02:39.800> build<00:02:40.900> around

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
something that they would build around

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.990 
something that they would build around
it<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.350> as<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> shielding<00:02:43.370> from<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
it just as like a shielding from the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.300 
it just as like a shielding from the
elements<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:45.680> don't<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:45.980> if<00:02:46.130> they<00:02:46.250> did

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
elements and I don't know if they did

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.060 
elements and I don't know if they did
this<00:02:46.640> on<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.850> lot<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.210> buildings<00:02:47.710> probably<00:02:48.710> they

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
this on a lot of buildings probably they

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.320 
this on a lot of buildings probably they
just<00:02:49.250> did<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.460> on<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.670> church<00:02:49.940> because<00:02:50.210> they

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
just did this on the church because they

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.850 
just did this on the church because they
weren't<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> last<00:02:50.960> a<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.350> long<00:02:51.470> time

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
weren't in the last a really long time

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.290 
weren't in the last a really long time
and<00:02:52.190> since<00:02:52.310> they<00:02:52.700> didn't<00:02:52.910> build<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.150> lot<00:02:53.270> of

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and since they didn't build a lot of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.620 
and since they didn't build a lot of
stuff<00:02:53.510> out<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.720> stone<00:02:54.080> because<00:02:54.530> wood<00:02:55.310> was

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
stuff out of stone because wood was

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.900 
stuff out of stone because wood was
prevalent<00:02:56.630> building<00:02:57.080> material<00:02:57.670> that's<00:02:58.670> what

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
prevalent building material that's what

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.290 
prevalent building material that's what
that<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.240> so<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.510> kind<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.960> added<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.770> here

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
that is so I kind of added that on here

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.480 
that is so I kind of added that on here
they<00:03:02.300> also<00:03:02.450> had<00:03:02.950> all<00:03:03.950> these<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:04.340> little

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
they also had all these like little

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.380 
they also had all these like little
dragon<00:03:04.970> head<00:03:05.150> thingies<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.470> they<00:03:07.390> had

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
dragon head thingies and and they had

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.260 
dragon head thingies and and they had
sort<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.960> like<00:03:09.340> arches<00:03:10.340> kind<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:10.970> string

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
sort of a like arches kind of string

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.500 
sort of a like arches kind of string
together<00:03:12.730> along<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.880> back<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.420> know

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
together along the back but you know

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.790 
together along the back but you know
this<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.840> best<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.110> can<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.500> I'm<00:03:15.620> not

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
this is the best you can do and I'm not

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.770 
this is the best you can do and I'm not
sure<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.130> they<00:03:16.280> had<00:03:16.430> bells<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:17.150> didn't<00:03:17.480> seen

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
sure if they had bells I didn't seen

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.510 
sure if they had bells I didn't seen
anything<00:03:18.020> in<00:03:18.170> my<00:03:18.260> research<00:03:18.560> on<00:03:18.920> whether<00:03:19.400> or

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
anything in my research on whether or

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.770 
anything in my research on whether or
not<00:03:19.550> they<00:03:19.700> had<00:03:19.850> bells<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.270> I<00:03:20.330> put<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:20.630> in

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
not they had bells but I put one in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.590 
not they had bells but I put one in
there<00:03:21.100> they<00:03:22.100> did<00:03:22.280> have<00:03:22.460> a<00:03:22.730> ridiculous<00:03:23.450> amount

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
there they did have a ridiculous amount

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.540 
there they did have a ridiculous amount
of<00:03:23.780> crosses<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.500> outside<00:03:24.890> some<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.280> them

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
of crosses on the outside some of them

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.180 
of crosses on the outside some of them
were<00:03:26.270> even<00:03:26.420> like<00:03:26.720> sideways<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.770> they'd<00:03:27.920> like

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
were even like sideways so they'd like

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.820 
were even like sideways so they'd like
kind<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.460> jet<00:03:28.760> out<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.210> the<00:03:29.480> side<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.830> things

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
kind of jet out of the side of things

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.440 
kind of jet out of the side of things
instead<00:03:31.310> but<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:31.580> just<00:03:31.850> thought<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.060> looked

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
instead but I just thought that looked

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.900 
instead but I just thought that looked
kind<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.690> silly<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.230> didn't<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.340> but

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.670 

yeah<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.240> so<00:03:38.480> like<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.690> said<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.050> entire<00:03:39.470> thing

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
yeah and so like I said the entire thing

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.110 
yeah and so like I said the entire thing
was<00:03:39.830> just<00:03:39.860> made<00:03:40.130> out<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.310> wood<00:03:40.640> primarily

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
was just made out of wood primarily

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.580 
was just made out of wood primarily
except<00:03:41.390> for<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.570> foundation<00:03:41.990> so<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.560> a

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
except for the foundation so this is a

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.470 
except for the foundation so this is a
little<00:03:43.040> unrealistic<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:43.910> kind<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.210> wanted

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
little unrealistic but I kind of wanted

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.560 
little unrealistic but I kind of wanted
to<00:03:44.540> keep<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.960> same<00:03:45.760> build<00:03:46.760> style<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.420> had

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
to keep the same build style that I had

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.060 
to keep the same build style that I had
over<00:03:47.720> here<00:03:47.990> I<00:03:48.050> don't<00:03:48.410> want<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.590> change<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:48.950> much

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
over here I don't want to change it much

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.040 
over here I don't want to change it much
since<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:49.850> kind<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.180> made<00:03:50.390> up<00:03:50.510> fantasy

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
since this is kind of made up fantasy

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.990 
since this is kind of made up fantasy
anyway<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.860> doesn't<00:03:52.430> have<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.760> be<00:03:52.850> that

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
anyway it doesn't have to be that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.480 
anyway it doesn't have to be that
historically<00:03:53.540> accurate<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.110> also<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.280> roof

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
historically accurate and also the roof

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.540 
historically accurate and also the roof
would<00:03:55.790> be<00:03:55.850> wood<00:03:56.450> shingles<00:03:56.960> or<00:03:57.260> some<00:03:58.220> sort<00:03:58.460> of

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
would be wood shingles or some sort of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.350 
would be wood shingles or some sort of
clay<00:03:59.090> like<00:03:59.420> tile<00:04:00.520> so<00:04:01.520> I'm<00:04:01.850> using<00:04:02.120> hay<00:04:02.480> but<00:04:03.290> I'm

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
clay like tile so I'm using hay but I'm

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.790 
clay like tile so I'm using hay but I'm
saying<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.780> hay<00:04:05.990> is<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.230> little<00:04:06.650> more

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
saying that this hay is a little more

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.430 
saying that this hay is a little more
like<00:04:07.130> straw<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.240> mud<00:04:08.420> combo<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:09.290> it's

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
like straw and mud combo so it's

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.370 
like straw and mud combo so it's
probably<00:04:09.800> like<00:04:10.160> tougher<00:04:10.880> but<00:04:11.870> let's<00:04:12.230> go

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
probably like tougher but let's go

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.940 
probably like tougher but let's go
inside<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:15.290> interior<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:16.070> pretty<00:04:16.190> close

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
inside so the interior is pretty close

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.120 
inside so the interior is pretty close
I<00:04:18.010> haven't<00:04:18.460> fully<00:04:18.730> finished<00:04:19.240> it<00:04:19.420> yet<00:04:19.630> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
I haven't fully finished it yet I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.010 
I haven't fully finished it yet I
probably<00:04:21.130> gonna<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:21.580> add<00:04:21.880> some<00:04:22.480> some<00:04:22.870> more

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
probably gonna like add some some more

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.890 
probably gonna like add some some more
like<00:04:23.170> arches<00:04:23.560> like<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.890> arch<00:04:24.070> up<00:04:24.280> there

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
like arches like that arch up there

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.510 
like arches like that arch up there
above<00:04:25.900> each<00:04:26.110> one<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.410> these<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.490> don't

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
above each one of these and I don't

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.550 
above each one of these and I don't
believe<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.600> could<00:04:28.750> actually<00:04:28.930> get<00:04:29.320> up

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
believe that you could actually get up

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.380 
believe that you could actually get up
here<00:04:29.890> but<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.160> like<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.790> idea<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.090> going<00:04:31.240> up

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
here but I like the idea of going up

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.720 
here but I like the idea of going up
here<00:04:31.570> since<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:31.930> available<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.640> thought<00:04:33.640> it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
here since it's available I thought it

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.670 
here since it's available I thought it
was<00:04:33.850> kind<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.030> neat<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.390> then<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.320> gives<00:04:35.500> you

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
was kind of neat and then it gives you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.060 
was kind of neat and then it gives you
access<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:37.780> kind<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.170> like<00:04:38.440> upper<00:04:38.800> area

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
access to this kind of like upper area

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.940 
access to this kind of like upper area
here<00:04:39.400> which<00:04:39.670> could<00:04:39.880> be<00:04:39.940> maybe<00:04:40.510> we're<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
here which could be maybe we're like the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.940 
here which could be maybe we're like the
choir<00:04:42.190> would<00:04:42.490> live<00:04:42.730> or<00:04:43.000> something<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:46.950> this

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
choir would live or something but this

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.830 
choir would live or something but this
would<00:04:48.160> all<00:04:48.310> just<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:48.670> like<00:04:48.970> criss<00:04:49.240> cross<00:04:49.510> would

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
would all just be like criss cross would

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.140 
would all just be like criss cross would
support<00:04:50.740> structure<00:04:51.220> all<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.610> kind<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:51.880> stuff

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
support structure all that kind of stuff

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.510 
support structure all that kind of stuff
and<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:53.170> was<00:04:53.320> just<00:04:53.350> basically<00:04:53.830> just<00:04:53.950> to

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
and it was just basically just to

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.800 
and it was just basically just to
reinforce<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.210> whole<00:04:55.330> structure<00:04:55.690> and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
reinforce the whole structure and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.860 
reinforce the whole structure and
support<00:04:55.990> these<00:04:56.460> huge<00:04:57.460> grooves<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.510> they<00:04:58.690> had

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
support these huge grooves that they had

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.800 
support these huge grooves that they had
and<00:04:59.290> then<00:04:59.590> you<00:04:59.620> have<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.370> chandeliers<00:05:01.300> up

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
and then you have the chandeliers up

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.170 
and then you have the chandeliers up
there<00:05:02.050> you've<00:05:02.860> got<00:05:03.040> like<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.430> little<00:05:03.460> pulpit

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
there you've got like the little pulpit

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.990 
there you've got like the little pulpit
area<00:05:04.510> whatever<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.140> then<00:05:05.430> behind<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.640> I've

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
area whatever and then behind that I've

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.140 
area whatever and then behind that I've
got<00:05:07.950> another<00:05:08.950> room<00:05:09.250> back<00:05:09.520> here<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.030> haven't

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
got another room back here and I haven't

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.750 
got another room back here and I haven't
decided<00:05:10.450> if<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.780> want<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:10.990> make<00:05:11.140> this<00:05:11.320> like

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
decided if I want to make this like

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.730 
decided if I want to make this like
where<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.880> priest<00:05:13.120> would<00:05:13.300> live<00:05:13.510> or<00:05:13.990> if<00:05:14.590> it

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
where the priest would live or if it

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.260 
where the priest would live or if it
would<00:05:14.830> just<00:05:14.980> be<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.250> where<00:05:15.760> they<00:05:15.880> store

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
would just be like where they store

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.150 
would just be like where they store
their<00:05:16.390> robes<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.870> things<00:05:17.140> for<00:05:17.470> ceremonies<00:05:17.950> or

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
their robes and things for ceremonies or

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.590 
their robes and things for ceremonies or
what-have-you<00:05:18.310> but<00:05:19.050> this<00:05:20.050> particular

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.910 

settlement<00:05:25.600> I<00:05:25.660> guess<00:05:25.840> town<00:05:26.440> whatever<00:05:26.740> you

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.720 
pseudo graveyard out here we're just
kind<00:06:01.480> of<00:06:01.540> random<00:06:01.990> headstones<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.070> things<00:06:03.250> and

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
kind of random headstones and things and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.580 
kind of random headstones and things and
our<00:06:04.720> little<00:06:04.990> friend<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.320> spider<00:06:05.610> but<00:06:07.560> not<00:06:08.560> a

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
our little friend the spider but not a

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.930 
our little friend the spider but not a
hundred<00:06:08.860> percent<00:06:08.980> happy<00:06:09.400> with<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.700> church

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
hundred percent happy with the church

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.160 
hundred percent happy with the church
but<00:06:10.150> I<00:06:10.180> think<00:06:10.420> after<00:06:10.540> I<00:06:10.720> added<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:11.050> little

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
but I think after I added the little

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.380 
but I think after I added the little
Tower<00:06:11.440> and<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.890> extra<00:06:12.160> crosses<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.910> raised

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
Tower and the extra crosses and raised

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.200 
Tower and the extra crosses and raised
those<00:06:13.750> like<00:06:14.560> dragon<00:06:14.950> heads<00:06:15.130> up<00:06:15.310> one<00:06:15.760> block<00:06:15.910> and

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
those like dragon heads up one block and

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.960 
those like dragon heads up one block and
put<00:06:16.390> the<00:06:16.570> spines<00:06:16.990> behind<00:06:17.380> them<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.820> really<00:06:18.820> like

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
put the spines behind them I really like

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.570 
put the spines behind them I really like
the<00:06:19.240> way<00:06:19.360> it's<00:06:19.540> starting<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.900> look<00:06:20.050> now<00:06:20.580> it

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
the way it's starting to look now it

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.460 
the way it's starting to look now it
would<00:06:21.820> be<00:06:21.850> twice<00:06:22.240> as<00:06:22.480> tall<00:06:22.690> if<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.050> was<00:06:23.200> to<00:06:23.350> be

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
would be twice as tall if it was to be

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.450 
would be twice as tall if it was to be
more<00:06:23.740> realistic<00:06:24.630> but<00:06:25.630> it<00:06:26.230> just<00:06:26.440> is<00:06:26.650> already

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
more realistic but it just is already

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.630 
more realistic but it just is already
like<00:06:28.050> dwarfing<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.770> other<00:06:29.890> buildings<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.490> mean

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
like dwarfing the other buildings I mean

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.500 
like dwarfing the other buildings I mean
it's<00:06:30.760> not

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
it's not

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.600 
it's not
that<00:06:31.930> much<00:06:32.230> bigger<00:06:32.470> than<00:06:32.950> say<00:06:33.190> like<00:06:33.460> the

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
that much bigger than say like the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.660 
that much bigger than say like the
market<00:06:34.060> but<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.630> markets<00:06:35.050> huge<00:06:35.500> and<00:06:36.220> so<00:06:36.430> this

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
market but the markets huge and so this

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.000 
market but the markets huge and so this
church<00:06:37.030> is<00:06:37.300> pretty<00:06:37.570> big<00:06:37.810> too<00:06:38.050> but<00:06:38.350> anyway<00:06:38.470> I

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
church is pretty big too but anyway I

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.580 
church is pretty big too but anyway I
hope<00:06:39.910> you<00:06:40.090> like<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.270> and<00:06:40.750> let<00:06:41.320> me<00:06:41.350> know<00:06:41.410> what
