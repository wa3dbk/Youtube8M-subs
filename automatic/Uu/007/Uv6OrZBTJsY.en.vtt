00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello friends my name is brand in and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.019
 tatyana and welcome to my channel 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.030
 Today I will make a necklace from 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.440
 polymer clay and beads such 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.910
 master class is suitable even for the most 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.189
 novice masters 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.619
 after your letters on the subject of complexity 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 I decided to remove master classes 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 not a difficult lesson but for work i 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.940
 used polymer clay 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.370
 silver dark blue 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 ball head stack blades 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 plain beads accessories fishing line 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.140
 cabochon and texture sheet fimo crush 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 I roll polymeric clay of blue color 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 and cut it into identical small 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.030
 bars form with a bead bar 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.899
 cat them in the palms before smoothing the edges and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.280
 giving the bead a round shape 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 splashing a texture sheet with water for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 so that the clay does not stick in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 surface I put the workpiece on 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.270
 surface and cover it with a sheet 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.619
 crush the hell flat cakes it turns out flat 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.540
 texture bead 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:22.159
 and now with a needle I make a hole 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.159
 in the middle of each bead 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 using round qatar I cut out the base 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.490
 under the suspension in the middle of the suspension 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.790
 squeeze the cabochon I only wrap 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.930
 folding floor polymer clay mixture 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.330
 drawing of clay you can think of 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.100
 completely different for example lay it out 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.970
 small balls spirals 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.630
 pigtails 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.310
 but guys my case is thin stripes 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.820
 smoothing the edges and using the stack on our 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.200
 clay texture 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.930
 we roll small balls in the same way 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.960
 size as well as extra beads from 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.680
 which I will collect necklaces and thread 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 there are holes in them 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.330
 to make the product shine all the parts 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.520
 can be covered with metal powder fimo 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.450
 I put a thin layer of powder on 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.450
 wedge surface 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.459
 send all the details burn only 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.819
 I have time to start assembling beads 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.819
 pins 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.950
 my blanks burned and cooled and 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.900
 to fix with powder on 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.670
 I cover the surfaces with varnish 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.220
 the beads were covered first with one 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.220
 sides then dry it around 2 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.470
 from the center of the track starting from the suspension 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.690
 proceed to the assembly alternating hang beads 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:13.360
 the distance I need to build 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:15.580
 turns airy and fluffy further 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:34.990
 combining metal separators 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:37.150
 polymer beads continue to build on 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.000
 the ends of the necklace using clamping let 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.539
 I will strengthen the lock and voila my necklace is ready 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.340
 and with you was bryantseva tatyana if you
