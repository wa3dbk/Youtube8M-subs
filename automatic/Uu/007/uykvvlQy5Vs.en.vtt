running<00:02:25.270> use<00:02:26.270> them<00:02:26.480> yesterday<00:02:26.720> they<00:02:27.080> felt

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
running use them yesterday they felt

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.330 
running use them yesterday they felt
great<00:02:28.210> not<00:02:29.210> a<00:02:29.410> runner<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:30.800> don't<00:02:31.010> think<00:02:31.190> I

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
great not a runner so I don't think I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.590 
great not a runner so I don't think I
can<00:02:31.459> tell<00:02:31.700> too<00:02:32.090> much<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.480> difference

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
can tell too much of a difference

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.020 
can tell too much of a difference
compared<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.200> typical<00:02:33.440> running<00:02:33.920> shoe<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
compared to typical running shoe but the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.910 
compared to typical running shoe but the
main<00:02:35.300> thing<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.900> they're<00:02:36.110> saying<00:02:36.350> when<00:02:36.770> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
main thing is they're saying when you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.560 
main thing is they're saying when you
land<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.370> your<00:02:37.430> heel<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:39.200> energy<00:02:39.709> that's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
land on your heel the energy that's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.780 
land on your heel the energy that's
absorbed<00:02:41.570> from<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.530> end<00:02:42.800> acts<00:02:43.130> as<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> slinky

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
absorbed from this end acts as a slinky

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.270 
absorbed from this end acts as a slinky
and<00:02:44.060> pushes<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.630> towards<00:02:44.870> when<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.530> take<00:02:46.160> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
and pushes it towards when you take the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.330 
and pushes it towards when you take the
next<00:02:46.550> step<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.600> land<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.530> then<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.070> take

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
next step so you land and then you take

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.110 
next step so you land and then you take
the<00:02:49.430> next<00:02:49.670> step

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
the next step

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.590 
the next step
supposedly<00:02:51.050> it's<00:02:51.350> it's<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.250> reduce<00:02:52.430> about<00:02:53.180> 20

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
supposedly it's it's to reduce about 20

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.350 
supposedly it's it's to reduce about 20
percent<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.110> your<00:02:54.230> energy<00:02:54.290> usage<00:02:55.209> when<00:02:56.209> you're

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
percent of your energy usage when you're

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.270 
percent of your energy usage when you're
running<00:02:56.570> gives<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.590> little<00:02:57.830> more<00:02:57.950> stamina

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
running gives you a little more stamina

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.390 
running gives you a little more stamina
less<00:02:58.880> fatigue<00:02:59.209> your<00:02:59.330> muscles<00:02:59.450> but<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.410> don't
