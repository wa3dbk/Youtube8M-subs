00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
some of the get some of the commercials

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.840 
some of the get some of the commercials
like<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.920> Volkswagen<00:03:32.370> commercial<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.730> was

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
like the Volkswagen commercial I was

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
like the Volkswagen commercial I was
released<00:03:33.060> today<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.420> think<00:03:33.690> it'd<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.840> been

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
released today I think it'd have been

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.570 
released today I think it'd have been
more<00:03:34.050> effective<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.500> was<00:03:34.620> released<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.370> day

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
more effective it was released the day

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.610 
more effective it was released the day
of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> Super<00:03:36.120> Bowl<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.840> would<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.560> been

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
of the Super Bowl and it would have been

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.840 
of the Super Bowl and it would have been
more<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> surprise<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:38.730> that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
more of a surprise and I think that

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.130 
more of a surprise and I think that
we've<00:03:38.970> been<00:03:39.180> anticipating<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.750> cuz<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.989> get

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
into the commercial for 45 seconds

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.920 
into the commercial for 45 seconds
