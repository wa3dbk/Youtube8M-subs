00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
practice session is octaves now when I

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.080 
practice session is octaves now when I
started<00:00:10.080> with<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.130> doing<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.610> general

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
started with just doing the general

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.629 
started with just doing the general
slurring<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.929> was<00:00:13.290> just<00:00:13.500> going<00:00:13.769> down<00:00:14.250> to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
slurring I was just going down to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.859 
slurring I was just going down to
basically<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.750> next<00:00:16.080> open<00:00:16.440> notes<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.359> then

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
basically the next open notes and then

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.439 
basically the next open notes and then
as<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.380> working<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.920> intervals<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.880> was

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
as I was working on intervals I was

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.929 
as I was working on intervals I was
increasing<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.590> notes<00:00:22.859> up<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.310> far<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.789> an

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
increasing the notes up as far as an

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.380 
increasing the notes up as far as an
octave<00:00:27.769> what<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.160> doing<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.640> gradually

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
octave what that was doing is gradually

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.380 
octave what that was doing is gradually
giving<00:00:30.960> my<00:00:31.289> embouchure<00:00:31.710> time<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.910> warm<00:00:33.180> up

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
giving my embouchure time to warm up

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
giving my embouchure time to warm up
because<00:00:33.780> you'll<00:00:33.960> notice<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.559> mean<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> longer

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
because you'll notice I mean the longer

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819 
because you'll notice I mean the longer
or<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> father<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.540> distance<00:00:37.050> between<00:00:37.320> each

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
or the father the distance between each

or the father the distance between each
of<00:00:38.070> these<00:00:38.190> notes<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of these notes the more you have to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.520 
of these notes the more you have to
adjust<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:41.219> lips<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.420> rather<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:43.110> jaw

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.880 
adjust your lips and or rather your jaw
what's<00:00:44.160> called<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.700> embouchure<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> if

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
what's called your embouchure so if

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
what's called your embouchure so if
you're<00:00:47.070> starting<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.850> kind<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> thing

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
you're starting out that kind of thing

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260 
you're starting out that kind of thing
early<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.649> giving<00:00:50.270> your

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
early you're not really giving your

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
early you're not really giving your
embouchure<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> time<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> warm<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.680> properly

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
embouchure the time to warm up properly

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.729 
embouchure the time to warm up properly
so<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.940> I've<00:00:54.059> done<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> intervals<00:00:55.020> now

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
so now that I've done the intervals now

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
so now that I've done the intervals now
I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.329> bit

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I'm going to take it a little bit

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
I'm going to take it a little bit
farther<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.469> warm<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.460> octaves

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
farther and just warm up with octaves

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.349 
farther and just warm up with octaves
which<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> next<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.800> said<00:01:02.160> earlier<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
which is the next as I said earlier the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.960 
which is the next as I said earlier the
note<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.930> sounds<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.250> another<00:01:05.640> one

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
note that sounds just like another one

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
note that sounds just like another one
except<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.810> higher<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.439> pitch<00:01:07.740> like

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
except that it's higher in pitch like

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.670 
except that it's higher in pitch like
this<00:01:10.340> usually<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.820> them<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.540> usually<00:01:13.350> do

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this usually when I do them I usually do

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.640 
this usually when I do them I usually do
three<00:01:14.070> notes<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:15.119> tired<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:16.080> octaves

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
three notes or what tired of two octaves

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.280 
three notes or what tired of two octaves
so<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.009> start<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> low<00:01:17.850> F<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.020> again

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so if I start on the low F and and again

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
so if I start on the low F and and again
when<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.560> doing<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.009> continue<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.790> slur

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
when you're doing these continue to slur

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870 
when you're doing these continue to slur
them<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:21.900> tongue<00:01:22.200> yet<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.159> slurring<00:01:23.490> gives

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
them don't tongue yet the slurring gives

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
them don't tongue yet the slurring gives
you<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> better<00:01:24.840> opportunity<00:01:25.290> early<00:01:26.100> on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you your a better opportunity early on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
you your a better opportunity early on
to<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> embouchure<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to get to get the embouchure going and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
to get to get the embouchure going and
to<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.280> feeling<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> air<00:01:30.450> support

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
to get that feeling of the air support

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.190 
to get that feeling of the air support
that's<00:01:31.350> needed<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.890> keep<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.460> gliding<00:01:33.200> sound

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that's needed to keep that gliding sound

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
that's needed to keep that gliding sound
in<00:01:34.439> between<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> notes<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.549> real<00:01:35.759> flowing

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
in between the notes that real flowing

00:01:36.299 --> 00:02:07.520 
in between the notes that real flowing
sense

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.130 

that<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.830> hi-c<00:02:09.400> there<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:10.000> about<00:02:10.330> as<00:02:10.540> high<00:02:10.780> as

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
that the hi-c there is about as high as

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.230 
that the hi-c there is about as high as
I<00:02:11.440> would<00:02:11.620> go<00:02:11.800> for<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.100> moment<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.610> also<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
I would go for the moment and also the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300 
I would go for the moment and also the
clicking<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.900> heard<00:02:14.170> was<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.830> spit

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
clicking that you heard was the spit

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.720 
clicking that you heard was the spit
that<00:02:15.490> was<00:02:15.640> building<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.300> my<00:02:16.480> horn
