with<00:02:11.690> easy<00:02:11.990> flow<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.890> learned<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.460> lot<00:02:13.670> about

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
with easy flow and I learned a lot about

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.370 
with easy flow and I learned a lot about
putting<00:02:15.920> your<00:02:16.180> fantasies<00:02:17.180> into<00:02:17.390> reality<00:02:17.540> from

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
putting your fantasies into reality from

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.340 
putting your fantasies into reality from
her<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.060> did<00:02:20.510> everything<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:21.110> your<00:02:21.320> own

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
her so you did everything on your own

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.890 
her so you did everything on your own
you<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.670> powders<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.690> were

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you just got the powders and you were

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.290 
you just got the powders and you were
sorted<00:02:24.410> out<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.680> made<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> lot<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> mistakes<00:02:25.550> well

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
sorted out I made a lot of mistakes well

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.720 
sorted out I made a lot of mistakes well
and<00:02:26.780> try<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.110> make<00:02:27.470> flowers<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.460> clear

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and try to make flowers with clear

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.120 
and try to make flowers with clear
powder<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.330> was<00:02:29.510> not<00:02:29.690> really<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> success<00:02:30.560> but

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
powder it was not really a success but

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.460 
powder it was not really a success but
by<00:02:31.340> making<00:02:31.580> mistakes<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.480> think<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.260> also

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
by making mistakes I think that it also

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.800 
by making mistakes I think that it also
helps<00:02:33.830> me<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.070> be<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> better<00:02:34.370> educator<00:02:35.000> because

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
helps me to be a better educator because

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.840 
helps me to be a better educator because
I<00:02:36.010> understand<00:02:37.010> what<00:02:37.280> people<00:02:37.490> are<00:02:37.670> doing

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
I understand what people are doing

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.200 
I understand what people are doing
because<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.690> made<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.140> same<00:02:39.350> stakes<00:02:40.210> exactly

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
because I made the same stakes exactly

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.630 
because I made the same stakes exactly
and<00:02:41.480> then<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.110> say<00:02:42.290> come<00:02:42.620> come<00:02:42.890> here<00:02:43.280> little

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and then and say come come here little

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.030 
and then and say come come here little
flower<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.630> get<00:02:44.870> them<00:02:45.110> let<00:02:45.290> me<00:02:45.320> give<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.710> firm

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
flower and get them let me give a firm

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.580 
flower and get them let me give a firm
right<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.820> talk<00:02:47.240> about<00:02:47.360> inspiration<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.290> think

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
right and talk about inspiration I think

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.050 
right and talk about inspiration I think
as<00:02:48.710> an<00:02:48.860> education<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.520> get<00:02:49.700> your<00:02:49.880> inspiration

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
as an education you get your inspiration

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.780 
as an education you get your inspiration
from<00:02:50.540> your<00:02:50.870> students<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:52.190> sometimes<00:02:52.640> you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
from your students because sometimes you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.210 
from your students because sometimes you
show<00:02:53.030> something<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:53.960> turn<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.590> around<00:02:54.800> a

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
show something and they turn it around a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.130 
show something and they turn it around a
little<00:02:55.250> bit<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.540> makes<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.900> something

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
little bit and that makes it something

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.380 
little bit and that makes it something
completely<00:02:57.709> else<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:59.000> makes

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
completely else and that really makes

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.720 
completely else and that really makes
this<00:02:59.600> profession<00:03:00.140> really<00:03:00.410> cool<00:03:00.650> because<00:03:01.370> from

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
this profession really cool because from

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.910 
this profession really cool because from
everybody<00:03:02.300> has<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> different<00:03:03.410> idea<00:03:03.709> about

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
everybody has a different idea about

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.740 
everybody has a different idea about
colors<00:03:04.490> and<00:03:04.670> everything<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.300> can<00:03:05.480> take<00:03:05.720> a

colors and everything and you can take a
little<00:03:06.050> bit<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:06.500> there<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.130> mix<00:03:07.370> it

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
little bit here there and mix it

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.830 
little bit here there and mix it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
question is about the future how do you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.570 
question is about the future how do you
think<00:03:30.019> what<00:03:30.260> would<00:03:30.500> be<00:03:30.709> famous<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.250> future

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
think what would be famous in future

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.670 
think what would be famous in future
because<00:03:31.940> then<00:03:32.450> they<00:03:32.630> are<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:33.170> very<00:03:33.380> similar

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
because then they are is very similar

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.740 
because then they are is very similar
like<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.040> fashion<00:03:34.400> word<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.209> know<00:03:35.269> something

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
like a fashion word you know something

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.650 
like a fashion word you know something
is<00:03:35.870> trendy<00:03:36.290> something's<00:03:36.800> not<00:03:37.010> past<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:37.850> how

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
is trendy something's not past so how

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.509 
is trendy something's not past so how
would<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.959> consider<00:03:39.350> what<00:03:39.860> would<00:03:40.100> be<00:03:40.280> trend

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
would you consider what would be trend

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.479 
would you consider what would be trend
in<00:03:40.700> one<00:03:40.940> or<00:03:41.150> two<00:03:41.420> years<00:03:41.840> well<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.800> think<00:03:42.980> there

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
in one or two years well I think there

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.320 
in one or two years well I think there
is<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.610> tendency<00:03:43.910> towards<00:03:44.630> more<00:03:46.330> business

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
is a tendency towards more business

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.870 
is a tendency towards more business
thinking<00:03:47.690> also<00:03:48.170> with<00:03:48.530> nail<00:03:48.739> technicians<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
thinking also with nail technicians the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.240 
thinking also with nail technicians the
market<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.480> evolving<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.739> need<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.070> make

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
market is evolving so we need to make

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.699 
market is evolving so we need to make
more<00:03:52.580> efficient<00:03:53.180> use<00:03:53.239> of<00:03:53.390> our<00:03:53.720> time<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.290> other

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
more efficient use of our time and other

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.070
