 Hi, my name is Julian Jorge 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.580
 this video I tried to do the most 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.760
 As soon as possible we will install reid 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.400
 minimum for after the previous video 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.840
 which is the one of tumen items as we did 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.470
 we went to the folder where we had 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.419
 installed the minecraft we are going to version and 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.490
 we create a folder we copy this 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.109
 folder and we paste it and we change the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.109
 name just like these files 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.020
 we open this file with the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.310
 extension 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.950
 we open it with notebook 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.079
 we change the name to mod like the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.720
 name of the file up there we go 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.329
 well here I changed the name and I 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.210
 put the same as the file here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.940
 that has the same name as this one that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.049
 the folder well and we do next 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 we open this file with winrar the idea 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.700
 I was having 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 a single folder of a single file for 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.719
 several this 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.719
 mods ok well we copy these files 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.620
 we paste it in the other folder if it's the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 first you're going to start with minimum king 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.100
 cheap and delete a folder that is 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.900
 call goal and ok 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.900
 and we come to accept 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 and we are going to open 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.570
 okay 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.579
 they're going to have to go to edith profile and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.280
 select realize release release 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.690
 to perform 1.6 mobile low points 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.230
 okay 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.970
 once the elections before 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.890
 surely I had it selected that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.630
 directly boot the version that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.070

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.120
 this is the previous video 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.470
 in a 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.680
 in short as you can see I have too many 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.000
 times 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.760
 punctual minimum tightening the equipment of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.469
 it's good we press the m key to 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.950
 can configure the menu 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.230
 activated 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.940
 the style of the team that we want 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.030
 see 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 is from above satellite type if it is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.140
 depending on the biomes 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.560
 let say 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.560
 we have a lot of things 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.080
 the types of textures to make the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.000
 redonditos and those squares and nothing beyond 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.130
 Directly direct the nomads 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 because after setting something and everything 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.910
 the world has it so less you and it's going 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.660
 to be a mess yes as I said in the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.880
 previous life and see nothing guys in a 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.860
 while his fast and fine and good excuse 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.220
 for making so many separate videos is that 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.739
 is going to be the best for me and what is 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.920
 so that everything goes up like this 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.090
