00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.867
 Frames in the next show are many 

00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:23.001
 highly influential and can be 

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:25.549
 shocking for viewers as they shocked us as well. 

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.427
 However, we must show the truth about 

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:28.563
 cruelty to animals. 

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:36.834
 Dear viewers, you are with Stop Cruelty to Animals 

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.632
 on Suprim Master Television 

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.348
 with today's program targeting animals 

00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:44.166
 in captivity and the terrible torture, 

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.799
 which they tolerate. 

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:48.309
 Zoo around the world has a variety of sizes, 

00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:51.322
 but whether large or small, 

00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:53.401
 the animals gathered there, used to circling 

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.832
 long distances in the wild, to swim 

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:59.056
 free in the deep oceans 

00:00:57.335 --> 00:00:59.056
 or fly into the spacious blue sky, 

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:03.939
 are not in place in concrete-steel cells. 

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:06.448
 No matter what effort the zoo is doing to improve it 

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.589
 its enclosures for animals, 

00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:11.038
 the fact remains that his inhabitants are not free 

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:13.750
 and will never feel the overall social, 

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:16.622
 environmental and physical advantages, 

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:19.309
 which nature provides. 

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:21.919
 Zoo are revenue-based establishments 

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:24.580
 from the sale of tickets and the sale of goods, 

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:27.728
 in order to continue their existence. 

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:29.057
 To reduce costs 

00:01:29.092 --> 00:01:31.107
 many zoos employ fewer staff than necessary, 

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:32.378
 but to those who are 

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:33.959
 recruits may lack training and skills 

00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:37.110
 to care for sensitive animals properly. 

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:39.809
 But the well-being of the occupants is down the list of priorities, 

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:43.024
 when zoos try to stay profitable. 

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:46.249
 Let's explore where they first came from 

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:48.930
 the creatures enclosed in zoos. 

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:51.636
 Some are bred in zoos, a process filled with 

00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:55.561
 danger and unmeasured torture for participating animals. 

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:58.521
 In order to achieve successful breeding in captivity, 

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.406
 conditions should be as close as possible 

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.394
 to the natural environment of the animals from the point of view of 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.333
 climate and habitat. 

00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:08.066
 Enough space, minimal contact with people 

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.901
 and a population of sufficient size to avoid 

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:14.504
 the negative effects of crossing 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.890
 between companion animals are also required. 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.631
 Small genetic banks lead to near - crossing crossing to 

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.514
 decreased activity, life expectancy and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.313
 levels of survival among offspring. 

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:28.276
 Since zoos can never provide the ideal conditions 

00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:30.974
 for natural reproduction, they most often resort to 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.492
 humiliating, painful and emotional 

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.350
 damaging process of artificial fertilization. 

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:39.359
 Let's learn about this procedure from 

00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:40.707
 Catherine Doyle, 

00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:43.774
 the leader of elephant campaigns of the respected 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.858
 US-based non-profit organization, 

00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:47.616
 In Animal Protection. 

00:02:54.493 --> 00:02:57.026
 Elephants in zoos do not multiply alone 

00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:59.475
 of course this is due to their placement in these 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.198
 very small enclosures and in unnatural conditions. 

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:06.144
 And this includes not only the physical conditions, 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.354
 but also residence in inappropriate social groups 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.006
 and actually living a life that is very small 

00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:16.136
 a resemblance to the one who would live in nature. 

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:20.461
 So what are the zoos trying to do now to overcome them? 

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.446
 problems with reproduction - apply 

00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:24.701
 artificial insemination with elephants. 

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:29.210
 And although people can choose this procedure, 

00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:31.143
 surely the elephants would not. 

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:34.243
 We believe it is cruel and violent 

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:36.594
 to perform artificial fertilization 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.527
 of elephants. 

00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:39.614
 And although they put these efforts into action, 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.935
 I would say that they are not very successful even in this way. 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.971
 And again until the elephants 

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:49.409
 are grown in these unnatural and 

00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:53.394
 inappropriate conditions, they will continue to 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.904
 have problems with breeding failures, 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.376
 as well as reproductive disorders 

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:02.178
 and some other health problems. 

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:06.821
 Some zoos accept animals purchased 

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:09.250
 from circuses or caught in nature, 

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.242
 indicating that they have no real intention of supporting it 

00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:14.281
 efforts to preserve species. 

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.497
 Private collectors can catch animals and get them 

00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:18.908
 sell to zoos afterwards. 

00:04:18.943 --> 00:04:21.929
 The rarest animals are most sought after, so 

00:04:21.964 --> 00:04:24.098
 they reach the highest prices. 

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:27.436
 The process of catching wild animals is 

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:30.821
 extremely stressful for them and many injured 

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:32.421
 or killed during this process. 

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:36.304
 The kidnapped animal is detached from his family, 

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:38.740
 causing this suffering to its members as well 

00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:41.174
 and the individual concerned. 

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:44.369
 After that, the frightened animal is transported in dark, 

00:04:44.404 --> 00:04:47.370
 narrow, dirty cells for thousands of kilometers 

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:48.445
 on water. 

00:04:48.525 --> 00:04:50.741
 During the journey many animals die from 

00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:54.078
 heat, exhaustion, thirst, hunger or lack of 

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:55.473
 medical control. 

00:04:55.508 --> 00:04:58.058
 What awaits the kidnapped wildlife, 

00:04:58.093 --> 00:05:00.779
 when they finally arrive to their destination? 

00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:03.594
 The only way to describe it would be 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.478
 "Life sentence prison." 

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:08.938
 It has been proven that captured animals have 

00:05:08.973 --> 00:05:12.399
 a much shorter life than their companions 

00:05:12.434 --> 00:05:13.479
 in nature. 

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.355
 For example, a recent survey conducted by 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.348
 Guelph University in Canada is researching 

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:22.386
 life expectancy of African and Asian elephants 

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:26.206
 in European zoos between 1960 and 2005 

00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:30.032
 and concludes that while the elephants in their natural 

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:33.399
 environment can live for 50 years or more, 

00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:37.680
 African elephants in captivity usually live for only 17 years, 

00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:40.665
 and the Asian elephants - only 19 years old. 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.517
 Now let's see the conditions in the zoo 

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:45.918
 and their unfavorable physical 

00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:48.114
 and psychological impacts on their occupants. 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:51.212
 First, the space in many zoological barriers 

00:05:51.247 --> 00:05:52.769
 is extremely limited. 

00:05:52.804 --> 00:05:56.258
 Most large zoos are located in or near 

00:05:56.293 --> 00:05:59.064
 to large cities, where the land is scarce. 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.475
 This often means that some of the fastest 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.789
 in the world terrestrial animals do not have enough space even 

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.719
 to walk fast, and the birds that are accustomed to roaring in the sky, 

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:12.008
 can barely wring their wings in their metal cages. 

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:14.957
 White bears, which normally have a territory of about 

00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:16.644
 80,000 sq km, 

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:19.645
 are kept in small concrete pools. 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.442
 There is only one white bear in captivity 

00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:24.653
 in Britain. 

00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:26.994
 According to the Foundation "Born Free" 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.893
 a not-for-profit British non-profit organization 

00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:33.888
 nature, 12 out of 20 or 60% of polar bears who 

00:06:33.923 --> 00:06:36.642
 before they lived in British zoos, were rated 

00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:39.846
 as having behavioral deviations as a result of their 

00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:42.485
 extremely poor and limited living conditions. 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.090
 In nature, animals are distributed naturally 

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.675
 in groups of different sizes. 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.657
 In other words, social animals such as 

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:54.354
 elephants and wolves need to live 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.887
 in flocks or packs of the appropriate size. 

00:06:56.922 --> 00:07:00.720
 In principle, single animals should not be forced 

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:02.107
 to live with others. 

00:07:02.142 --> 00:07:05.111
 These important situations are rarely taken 

00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:06.875
 given by zoos. 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.422
 Rather, the availability of space and the cost of shelters are 

00:07:10.457 --> 00:07:13.538
 the primary factors for these animal prisons. 

00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:17.195
 When we get back we will continue our program for 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.853
 animals in captivity in zoos. 

00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:20.465
 Please stay with 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.744
