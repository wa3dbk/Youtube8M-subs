dirt here's another trophy kill so here

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.939 
dirt here's another trophy kill so here
he<00:00:23.490> has<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.760> disabled<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> these

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
he has it disabled some of these

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.839 
he has it disabled some of these
generators<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> break<00:00:27.420> into<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.849> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
generators so it can break into the to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.890 
generators so it can break into the to
the<00:00:29.970> base

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.010 

multiple<00:00:37.770> targets<00:00:38.130> multiple<00:00:38.550> enemies<00:00:39.020> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
multiple targets multiple enemies you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.420 
multiple targets multiple enemies you
gotta<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.290> really<00:00:40.500> careful<00:00:40.620> here

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

setting<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.480> trap

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.760 

disabling<00:01:23.200> another<00:01:23.469> one<00:01:23.619> of<00:01:23.680> their

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
disabling another one of their

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:36.190 
disabling another one of their
generators

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.399 

Oh<00:01:37.509> Larry<00:01:38.509> just<00:01:38.719> snuck<00:01:38.990> into<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.259> base

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.480 

I<00:01:43.499> don't<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.280> it

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.520 

show<00:01:51.490> pickles<00:01:51.850> are<00:01:51.970> really<00:01:52.270> cool<00:01:52.480> i'll<00:01:53.410> be

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
show pickles are really cool i'll be

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:19.640 
show pickles are really cool i'll be
able<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.710> do<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:53.980> multiplayer<00:01:54.430> as<00:01:54.670> well

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.949 

disabling<00:02:20.430> more<00:02:20.640> generators<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.569> think

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
disabling more generators I think

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.240 
disabling more generators I think
there's<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.200> couple<00:02:22.349> more<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:22.829> level<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
there's a couple more on this level that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.530 
there's a couple more on this level that
needs<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.519> take<00:02:23.700> care<00:02:23.879> of<00:02:23.939> before<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
needs to take care of before I can

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.119 
needs to take care of before I can

finish off this demo here you can also

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.119 
finish off this demo here you can also
take<00:02:29.400> out<00:02:29.549> turrets<00:02:29.939> as<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.890> Marines<00:02:31.890> have

being high and really being able to
survey<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.790> areas<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.569> what's<00:03:09.930> key<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
survey the areas is what's key for the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.980

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.770 

what<00:03:16.860> everywhere<00:03:17.280> Scott<00:03:18.090> Oh<00:03:18.120> careful<00:03:18.390> be

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
what everywhere Scott Oh careful be

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.320 
what everywhere Scott Oh careful be
careful<00:03:18.810> gossip<00:03:19.530> blood

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.450 

plasma<00:03:27.110> caster<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.530> great<00:03:27.800> weapon<00:03:28.010> just

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
plasma caster is a great weapon just

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.730 
plasma caster is a great weapon just
ranged<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.960> takes<00:03:30.140> them<00:03:30.320> out<00:03:30.440> with<00:03:30.590> one

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
ranged and just takes them out with one

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:46.280 
ranged and just takes them out with one
shot

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.709 

so<00:03:46.920> now<00:03:47.129> he<00:03:47.189> is<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.849> one<00:03:48.719> of<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.989> marine<00:03:49.590> heads

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
so now he is the one of the marine heads

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.809 
so now he is the one of the marine heads
earlier<00:03:51.719> he's<00:03:52.079> got<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> retinal<00:03:52.829> scan<00:03:53.099> so<00:03:53.760> he

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
earlier he's got a retinal scan so he

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.660 
earlier he's got a retinal scan so he
could<00:03:53.969> get<00:03:54.030> into<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.390> base<00:03:58.250> here's<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.340> trophy

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
could get into the base here's a trophy

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.099 
could get into the base here's a trophy
go<00:03:59.819> from<00:04:00.000> behind<00:04:05.269> melee<00:04:06.269> attacks<00:04:06.599> are<00:04:06.900> great

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
go from behind melee attacks are great

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:32.470

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
is the credit which is from abp to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.000 
is the credit which is from abp to
you'll<00:04:41.810> see<00:04:41.990> tons<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.380> different<00:04:42.500> cool
