00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that I needed to go into the hospital

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
that I needed to go into the hospital
and<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.070> were<00:01:32.189> gonna<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.610> dat<00:01:32.939> treatments

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and they were gonna do dat treatments

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
and they were gonna do dat treatments
that<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.229> help<00:01:34.439> reduce<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> swelling<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that would help reduce the swelling of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.520 
that would help reduce the swelling of
the<00:01:35.700> brain<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.299> make<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> migraine

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
the brain and make all of the migraine
symptoms<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:38.729> away<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.720> equivalent<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
symptoms go away it's equivalent to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
symptoms go away it's equivalent to
chemotherapy<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.270> later<00:01:42.630> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
chemotherapy but so they just later in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
chemotherapy but so they just later in
pain<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.369> nothing<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> mother

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
pain and there is nothing as a mother

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.380 
pain and there is nothing as a mother
you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.049> had<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.700> cut<00:01:48.030> my<00:01:48.180> arm

would<00:03:38.340> come<00:03:38.580> two<00:03:39.000> days<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.209> week<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.810> two<00:03:39.870> hours

would come two days a week for two hours
each<00:03:40.620> day<00:03:40.700> but<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.850> thought<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.090> actually

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
each day but the thought of actually

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.759 
each day but the thought of actually
having<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.050> drive<00:03:43.440> again<00:03:43.680> was<00:03:44.130> even<00:03:45.470> more<00:03:46.470> hard

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
having to drive again was even more hard

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.680 
having to drive again was even more hard

for me to deal with to go from as mr.
Becker<00:03:51.900> has<00:03:52.170> told<00:03:52.440> me

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
Becker has told me

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.589 
Becker has told me
Blanche<00:03:53.150> being<00:03:54.160> mathematically<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.430> genius<00:03:56.330> I

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
Blanche being mathematically a genius I

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.660 
Blanche being mathematically a genius I
could<00:03:57.140> barely<00:03:57.260> read<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.950> could<00:03:58.099> barely<00:03:58.250> right

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
could barely read I could barely right

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.300 
could barely read I could barely right
but<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.660> was<00:03:59.870> basically<00:04:00.140> like<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.980> was<00:04:01.280> a
