unfold<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.379> fold<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.370> diagonal<00:00:45.030> again<00:00:45.329> but

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
unfold it and fold it diagonal again but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.590 
unfold it and fold it diagonal again but
the<00:00:46.110> other<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.579> fold<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.469> to<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> crease

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.160 
the littlest one out of all of them and
fold<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> diagonally

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.450 

unfold<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:41.300> turn<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.510> and<00:01:43.470> fold<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.190> diagonally

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
unfold it turn it and fold it diagonally

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.350 
unfold it turn it and fold it diagonally
against<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:51.000> unfold<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.570> disappeared<00:01:52.200> x

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
against so we unfold it disappeared x

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.760 
against so we unfold it disappeared x
okay<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.370> take<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.760> big<00:01:56.940> one<00:01:56.970> again<00:01:57.770> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
okay so you take the big one again you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.790 
okay so you take the big one again you
fold<00:01:59.010> it<00:01:59.100> diagonal<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:01.050> see<00:02:01.260> this<00:02:01.470> line

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
fold it diagonal but you see this line

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.660 
fold it diagonal but you see this line
right<00:02:01.980> here<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:03.210> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.510> fold<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:04.080> part

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
right here you want to fold this part

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:14.930 
right here you want to fold this part
across<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.180> line<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.100> like<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> it

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
across the line so it's like this so it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.250 
across the line so it's like this so it
looks<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.210> that<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.690> bottom<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
looks like that that's the bottom of the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.840 
looks like that that's the bottom of the
Christmas<00:02:19.650> tree<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.520> make<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
Christmas tree now we have to make the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.010 
Christmas tree now we have to make the
top<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.880> medium<00:02:24.360> one<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:26.720> we<00:02:27.720> fold

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
top so we get the medium one and we fold

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.080 
top so we get the medium one and we fold
it<00:02:28.320> down<00:02:29.090> diagonal<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.680> why<00:02:31.680> not<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:35.090> you'll

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
it down diagonal and why not here you'll

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.110 
it down diagonal and why not here you'll
fold<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:37.010> back<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:40.110> way<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:42.090> have

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
fold it back and that way we have

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
fold it back and that way we have
another<00:02:42.510> part<00:02:43.910> now<00:02:44.910> get<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> little<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:46.310> fold

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
another part now get the little one fold

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.010 
another part now get the little one fold
it<00:02:47.459> diagonal<00:02:49.250> see<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.430> line<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.060> fold<00:02:51.900> it

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
it diagonal see the line and fold it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.760 
it diagonal see the line and fold it
there<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.550> another<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.810> now<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
there and we have another one now the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.479 
there and we have another one now the
last<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:57.560> we<00:02:58.560> fold<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.750> diagonal<00:03:00.750> unfold<00:03:01.650> it

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
last one we fold it diagonal unfold it

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.860 
last one we fold it diagonal unfold it
and<00:03:02.760> then<00:03:03.630> turn<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.290> fold<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.310> again<00:03:05.870> but

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and then turn it and fold it again but

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.060 
and then turn it and fold it again but
we<00:03:07.020> already<00:03:07.170> did<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.770> right<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.709> fold<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
we already did that right so you fold it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.630 
we already did that right so you fold it
diagonal<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.940> should<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> line<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.290> sure

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
diagonal there should be a line for sure

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.920 
diagonal there should be a line for sure
so<00:03:14.840> when<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:15.989> fold<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:17.120> get<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> top<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
so when we fold it get the top of the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.690 
so when we fold it get the top of the
Christmas<00:03:19.110> tree

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
Christmas tree

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.380 
Christmas tree
and<00:03:22.330> now<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.230> make<00:03:23.800> stuff<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:29.500> have<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.680> have

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
and now to make stuff you have to have

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.729 
and now to make stuff you have to have
square<00:03:32.010> cut<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.250> rectangle<00:03:34.349> piece<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.560> paper

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
square cut the rectangle piece of paper

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.360 
square cut the rectangle piece of paper
so<00:03:36.519> it's<00:03:36.670> like<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.269> goes<00:03:40.510> up<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.780> lot

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
so it's like that and that goes up a lot

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.559 
so it's like that and that goes up a lot
so<00:03:43.019> skip<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.349> bottom<00:03:44.739> part<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.180> have

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569
