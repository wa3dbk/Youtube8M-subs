00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
think he will lose this game yeah I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.560 
think he will lose this game yeah I
don't<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.829> mean<00:01:50.220> maybe<00:01:50.909> maybe<00:01:51.329> if

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
don't really see I mean maybe maybe if

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.420 
don't really see I mean maybe maybe if
he<00:01:51.659> somehow<00:01:51.930> kill<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> arch<00:01:52.649> mates<00:01:52.920> later<00:01:53.189> on

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
he somehow kill the arch mates later on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
he somehow kill the arch mates later on
I<00:01:53.640> mean<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> shouldn't<00:01:54.360> forget<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.750> only

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I mean you shouldn't forget it's only

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
level 3 month King i think or maybe

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
level 3 month King i think or maybe
level<00:01:56.880> 40<00:01:57.710> level<00:01:58.710> 3<00:01:59.250> i<00:01:59.280> guess<00:01:59.700> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.360> first

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
level 40 level 3 i guess with the first

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.700 
level 40 level 3 i guess with the first
I<00:02:01.200> mean<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.770> 615<00:02:02.700> energy<00:02:03.090> since<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.960> 51<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I mean is 615 energy since on 51 out of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.870 
I mean is 615 energy since on 51 out of
the<00:02:04.829> water

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the water

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.100 
the water
really<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> lot<00:02:06.450> he<00:02:06.719> might<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
really really a lot he might be have to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.660 
really really a lot he might be have to
do<00:02:07.229> something<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.280> yeah<00:02:08.399> he's<00:02:08.550> gonna

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
do something with it but yeah he's gonna

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.010 
do something with it but yeah he's gonna
have<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.849> worry<00:02:09.090> about<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> base<00:02:09.509> race<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
have to worry about the base race and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
have to worry about the base race and
mass<00:02:10.229> teleportation<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.280> useful<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
mass teleportation is so useful in the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.690 
mass teleportation is so useful in the
base<00:02:12.120> ways<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.020> mean<00:02:13.230> Warren<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.250> still<00:02:14.459> one

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
base ways but I mean Warren is still one

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.100 
base ways but I mean Warren is still one
man<00:02:14.910> army<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.690> make<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.959> possible

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
man army and it can make it possible

the<00:02:52.890> expansion<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.450> right<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.099> he<00:02:56.099> he

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
the expansion to the right but he he

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.280 
the expansion to the right but he he
comes<00:02:56.840> back<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.290> think<00:02:59.160> sky<00:02:59.730> didn't<00:03:00.720> see

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
comes back but I think sky didn't see

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.650 
comes back but I think sky didn't see
this<00:03:01.500> expansion<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.459> was<00:03:02.610> built<00:03:02.819> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
this expansion because it was built you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.170 
this expansion because it was built you
know<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:04.049> in<00:03:04.230> standard<00:03:04.410> place<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.780> guess<00:03:08.180> 22

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
know not in standard place so I guess 22

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.660 
know not in standard place so I guess 22
minutes<00:03:09.540> sky<00:03:10.260> won't<00:03:10.410> check<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.890> spot<00:03:11.340> and

basil I've I think he will be fine in a
base<00:03:24.690> right<00:03:24.900> now<00:03:24.959> with<00:03:25.260> mass<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.680> avoid<00:03:25.920> it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
base right now with mass can avoid it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.280 
base right now with mass can avoid it
will<00:03:26.579> be<00:03:26.670> right<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.209> mean<00:03:27.720> moon<00:03:27.959> doesn't<00:03:28.170> have

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.490 
anything this is very smart this is
something<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.180> want<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.450> say<00:03:30.480> earlier<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:31.170> think

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
something I want to say earlier I think

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.770 
something I want to say earlier I think
moon<00:03:31.980> should<00:03:32.579> use<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.910> dry<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.359> better<00:03:33.569> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
moon should use this dry it's better to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.300 
moon should use this dry it's better to
control<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.290> unit<00:03:34.530> around<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.859> map<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.160> make

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
control the unit around the map to make

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.120 
control the unit around the map to make
sure<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.290> teleport<00:03:37.709> everywhere

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
sure that I just can teleport everywhere

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.229 
sure that I just can teleport everywhere
if<00:03:38.250> he<00:03:38.310> doesn't<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:38.670> building<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.090> he

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
if he doesn't have a building that he

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.120 
if he doesn't have a building that he
can<00:03:39.420> teleport<00:03:39.630> because<00:03:40.440> all<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.769> time<00:03:40.920> it's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
can teleport because all the time it's

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.890 
can teleport because all the time it's
just<00:03:41.280> like<00:03:41.430> one<00:03:41.579> rifleman<00:03:42.090> somewhere<00:03:42.510> where

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
just like one rifleman somewhere where

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.809 
just like one rifleman somewhere where
skies<00:03:43.200> able<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.530> teleport<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:44.130> town<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.639> don't

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
skies able to teleport to town I don't

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.220 
skies able to teleport to town I don't
know<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.060> think<00:03:45.150> moon<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:45.540> making<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.840> very<00:03:45.900> very

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
know I think moon is making it very very

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.819 
know I think moon is making it very very
hard<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.590> himself<00:03:48.290> ancient<00:03:49.290> environment

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
hard on himself ancient environment

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.319 
hard on himself ancient environment
that's<00:03:50.370> actually<00:03:50.489> very<00:03:50.700> good<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.180> kill

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
that's actually very good to kill

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.110 
that's actually very good to kill
buildings<00:03:52.160> rather<00:03:53.160> better<00:03:53.400> than<00:03:53.519> riots<00:03:54.000> of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
buildings rather better than riots of

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.240 
buildings rather better than riots of
course<00:03:54.359> me<00:03:54.720> answer<00:03:55.109> everything<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.130> better
