00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.259
 good and is that you have made very clear 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.480
 that you love the videos of porridges and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 I have brought another video with these 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.150
 two serious ones that I found in a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.040
 store that I had right here next to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.430
 house let's open it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.430
 ah 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:27.320
 and well, the first one is 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.570
 I call him little hooks 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.000
 really the bag calls them monchito if 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.510
 so these stickers come 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.370
 collectibles that you can find 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.050
 inside the bag I do not understand very well 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.750
 that is a verse that has to have 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.190
 tests well in the drawing but good in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.989
 end as I have told you they call it monchi 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.820
 I do not know if it's if you call them that 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.489
 you in your country or in yours 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.309
 zone but basically they have this look 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.780
 that you can see here and how it had 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.950
 advanced before then it comes with a consumption 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 that we are going to open right now we are going to 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.780
 see which character of daddy has touched us 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.320
 and is that they are impacts opening these 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.940
 things 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.260
 but as you can see we have had pepa 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.700
 pips and is that we have more luck here 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.700
 because it has and we believe it 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.979
 and also a quick eating a 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.979
 candy 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.689
 like this mosquito that gave me to eat 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.609
 and now because the truth is that they are 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.100
 very good are not the typical ones 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.020
 hooks have a hole in the middle 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.380
 and it gives a pretty cool roll and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 now let's open up what would be 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 cotton candy is a small boat in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 which I have decorated with motifs of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.319
 circus we can buy cotton from 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.319
 prefabricated sugar 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 I do not know very well if it is said but manufactured 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.820
 concern in this type of case 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.180
 but I think you have understood me all 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.180
 perfectly 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.650
 and also because the truth that does not have 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.360
 idea but it also has a chrome 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.760
 Collectable I do not know if it will be the same 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.380
 collection of those that we have found in 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.090
 the bag of monchito is but look never 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.650
 is wrong and I do not know if we will have so much 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.720
 luck as before and we will go to daddy 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.270
 because with the amount of characters that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.990
 there is in the series it would not be surprising 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.990
 that our each 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 good has touched us but you can not 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.120
 have so much luck in the same day if not 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.500
 I'm wrong I think this is your little 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.790
 brother that I do not remember the name if you 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.780
 you have left in the comments because 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.580
 right now I do not remember the name of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.220
 this character and good the sugar band 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.320
 for those who do not know it, this is it 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.420
 It is a characteristic sweet on 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.500
 all of circus fairs that's why 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.910
 precisely the pot is therefore 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.910
 covered with circus drawings 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 the boat like him 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.769
 bag that I show you the other day of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.319
 Daddy, the truth is that it's pretty 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.150
 reusable and still being plastic 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.739
 Holds pretty well and now it's your turn to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.319
 you decide in the comments what 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.469
 of the two 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.290
 you liked the boys the most 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.459
 hooks these leave me in the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.389
 comments and give likes I have 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.590
 liked the video see you next 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.590
