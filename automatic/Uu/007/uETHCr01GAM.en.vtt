a<00:01:13.619> connector<00:01:15.259> there<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.290> no<00:01:16.770> ferrule<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:18.630> is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
a connector there is no ferrule this is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
a connector there is no ferrule this is
just<00:01:19.080> bare<00:01:19.350> pole<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.100> far<00:01:21.090> end<00:01:23.240> we've<00:01:24.240> got

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
just bare pole on the far end we've got

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.160 
just bare pole on the far end we've got
little<00:01:24.659> stub<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.670> stub<00:01:26.909> plugs<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
little stub and kind of stub plugs so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.990 
little stub and kind of stub plugs so
there's<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:28.530> ferrule<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.640> ferals

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
there's no ferrule and the ferals

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.649 
there's no ferrule and the ferals
happens<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.480> go<00:01:30.680> toward<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> connectors<00:01:32.659> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
happens to go toward the connectors so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
happens to go toward the connectors so
the<00:01:33.780> Pharaohs<00:01:34.080> things<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.680> toward<00:01:34.950> the

yet and this guy the front hole
it's<00:01:49.039> 125<00:01:49.789> centimeters<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:52.280> very<00:01:52.520> first

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's 125 centimeters the very first

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.580 
it's 125 centimeters the very first
segment<00:01:54.249> 32<00:01:55.249> centimeters<00:01:55.999> and<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:57.259> three

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
segment 32 centimeters and then three

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.910 
segment 32 centimeters and then three
more<00:01:57.740> segments<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.689> 31<00:01:59.689> centimeters<00:02:00.109> so<00:02:00.619> four

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
more segments of 31 centimeters so four

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.809 
more segments of 31 centimeters so four
sections

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.309 

did<00:02:04.819> I<00:02:04.909> say<00:02:05.090> 32<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.899> three<00:02:06.560> times<00:02:06.799> 31<00:02:08.170> we're<00:02:09.170> on

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319
