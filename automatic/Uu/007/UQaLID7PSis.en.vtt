white<00:01:09.410> trash<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.880> first<00:01:11.209> time<00:01:11.420> through<00:01:11.750> I

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
white trash that first time through I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.590 
white trash that first time through I
was<00:01:12.590> not<00:01:12.860> real<00:01:13.280> convinced<00:01:13.819> that<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.270> was<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
was not real convinced that it was the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.749 
was not real convinced that it was the
best<00:01:14.840> way<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.110> run<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.470> rapid<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.100> John<00:01:16.520> Eddie

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
best way to run the rapid so John Eddie

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.480 
best way to run the rapid so John Eddie
doubt<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:17.300> came<00:01:17.929> through<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.229> knotch<00:01:18.440> said<00:01:18.830> I'm

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
doubt I came through the knotch said I'm

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.690 
doubt I came through the knotch said I'm
going<00:01:19.850> through<00:01:20.080> John<00:01:21.080> smiled<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.039> waved<00:01:22.429> me

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
going through John smiled and waved me

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.359 
going through John smiled and waved me
through<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.209> I<00:01:23.360> just<00:01:24.349> went<00:01:24.530> straight<00:01:24.619> down<00:01:25.069> I

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
through and I just went straight down I

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.499 
through and I just went straight down I
went<00:01:25.580> through<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.970> speed<00:01:26.240> trap

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
went through the speed trap

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.089 
went through the speed trap
I<00:01:26.690> think<00:01:26.899> speed<00:01:27.140> trap<00:01:27.349> is<00:01:27.530> worse<00:01:27.709> at<00:01:27.920> lower

00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:28.099 
I think speed trap is worse at lower

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.520 
I think speed trap is worse at lower
water<00:01:28.399> so<00:01:28.849> the<00:01:29.030> way<00:01:29.390> there<00:01:29.660> wasn't<00:01:29.990> too<00:01:30.319> big<00:01:30.500> a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
water so the way there wasn't too big a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.260 
water so the way there wasn't too big a
deal<00:01:30.679> Eddie<00:01:30.950> doubt<00:01:31.220> below<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.819> who<00:01:31.940> did<00:01:32.119> to

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
deal Eddie doubt below and who did to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.230 
deal Eddie doubt below and who did to
him<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.259> he<00:01:33.470> peeled<00:01:33.890> out<00:01:34.099> and<00:01:34.369> ran<00:01:34.819> his<00:01:35.000> boof

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
him and he peeled out and ran his boof

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.770 
him and he peeled out and ran his boof
just<00:01:35.770> perfectly<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:37.220> headed<00:01:37.490> out<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.849> hooted

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
just perfectly we headed out and hooted

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.630 
just perfectly we headed out and hooted
and<00:01:38.929> hollered<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.470> he<00:01:39.830> called<00:01:40.039> that<00:01:40.220> one<00:01:40.399> the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
and hollered and he called that one the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.850 
and hollered and he called that one the
zoom<00:01:40.849> flume<00:01:41.179> well<00:01:41.690> call<00:01:41.899> that<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.259> zoom<00:01:42.470> flume

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
zoom flume well call that the zoom flume

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.430 
zoom flume well call that the zoom flume
I<00:01:43.280> think<00:01:44.240> what<00:01:44.450> stands<00:01:44.929> out<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.289> most

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
I think what stands out the most

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.960 
I think what stands out the most
probably<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.789> squeeze<00:01:47.440> go<00:01:48.440> left<00:01:48.849> after<00:01:49.849> we

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
probably the squeeze go left after we

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.790 
probably the squeeze go left after we
had<00:01:50.090> run<00:01:50.270> through<00:01:50.479> it<00:01:50.599> John<00:01:51.020> said<00:01:51.289> this<00:01:51.500> one

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
had run through it John said this one

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.710 
had run through it John said this one
