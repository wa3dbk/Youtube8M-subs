there nonetheless and here I continued

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.130 
there nonetheless and here I continued
the<00:01:46.799> move<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.250> tried<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> put<00:01:48.180> my<00:01:48.689> teammate

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
through I believe that was schürrle but

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.109 
through I believe that was schürrle but
he<00:01:50.729> gets<00:01:50.939> collected<00:01:51.720> by<00:01:52.649> davide<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.820> go

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
he gets collected by davide and we do go

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870

trying to put a Mata away at the very

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
last moment thinking that he should most

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.110 
last moment thinking that he should most
hundred<00:02:35.590> percent<00:02:35.860> score<00:02:36.100> but<00:02:36.640> he<00:02:36.670> does<00:02:36.940> get

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
hundred percent score but he does get

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.570 
hundred percent score but he does get
saved<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.630> rebound<00:02:38.050> from<00:02:38.170> hazard<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.830> put

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
saved and the rebound from hazard is put

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.060 
saved and the rebound from hazard is put
wide<00:02:40.000> but<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.690> doesn't<00:02:41.290> matter<00:02:41.440> because<00:02:41.650> we

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
wide but it doesn't matter because we

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.610 
wide but it doesn't matter because we
win<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.550> Community<00:02:43.090> Shield<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:44.260> see<00:02:44.440> our

pretty wasted ball nothing up very
accurate<00:03:42.640> until<00:03:43.330> agar<00:03:43.900> actually<00:03:44.320> passes<00:03:44.920> it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
accurate until agar actually passes it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.730 
accurate until agar actually passes it
to<00:03:45.040> Mata<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.760> asked<00:03:46.390> for<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.660> pass<00:03:46.900> back<00:03:47.260> from

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
to Mata I asked for the pass back from

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.650 
to Mata I asked for the pass back from
the<00:03:47.860> cup<00:03:48.100> bag<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:48.580> put<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.209> back<00:03:49.450> of

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
the cup bag and I put it in the back of

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.750 
the cup bag and I put it in the back of
the<00:03:49.780> net<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.170> make<00:03:50.470> Liverpool<00:03:51.220> paid<00:03:51.490> that's

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the net to make Liverpool paid that's

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.330 
the net to make Liverpool paid that's
why<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.150> Dead<00:03:52.510> celebration<00:03:53.080> but<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.980> thought

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
why the Dead celebration but I thought

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.250 
why the Dead celebration but I thought
that<00:03:54.400> was<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:54.970> if<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.450> didn't<00:03:55.840> score<00:03:56.080> that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
that was like if I didn't score that

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.380 
that was like if I didn't score that
cutback<00:03:56.560> from<00:03:57.250> asking<00:03:57.700> from<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.000> position

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
cutback from asking from that position

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.880 
cutback from asking from that position
for<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.570> cutback<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.140> very<00:03:59.380> selfish<00:03:59.740> I

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
for a cutback it's very selfish I

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.530 
for a cutback it's very selfish I
believe<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.310> if<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.910> didn't<00:04:01.150> score<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.510> I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
believe in if I didn't score that I

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.760 
believe in if I didn't score that I
would<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:01.870> been<00:04:02.050> in<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.380> whole<00:04:02.590> lot<00:04:02.740> of

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
would have been in a whole lot of

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.280 
would have been in a whole lot of
trouble<00:04:03.160> but<00:04:03.250> thank<00:04:03.700> God<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:03.940> did<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.840> scoring

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
trouble but thank God I did the scoring

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.900 
trouble but thank God I did the scoring
and<00:04:05.410> from<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.740> quarter<00:04:06.070> actually<00:04:06.310> hit<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
and from a quarter actually hit the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.000 
and from a quarter actually hit the
crossbar<00:04:07.240> what's<00:04:08.170> been<00:04:08.440> happening<00:04:08.980> lately

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
crossbar what's been happening lately

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.490 
crossbar what's been happening lately
when<00:04:09.670> did<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.120> become<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.660> good<00:04:10.989> header<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
when did I become a good header of the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.979 
when did I become a good header of the
ball<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:12.370> makes<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.880> no<00:04:13.120> sense<00:04:13.540> but<00:04:13.810> a

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
ball that makes the no sense but a

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.650 
ball that makes the no sense but a
halftime<00:04:14.650> one<00:04:15.040> nil<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.880> second<00:04:16.239> half<00:04:16.390> we

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
actually pay them back with an overtop

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.599 
actually pay them back with an overtop
through<00:04:20.560> ball<00:04:20.710> of<00:04:20.830> our<00:04:20.950> own<00:04:21.130> right<00:04:21.460> from

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
through ball of our own right from

through ball of our own right from
kickoff<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.300> then<00:04:22.419> I'm<00:04:22.570> inside<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.110> box<00:04:23.320> with

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
kickoff and then I'm inside the box with

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.129 
kickoff and then I'm inside the box with
a<00:04:23.560> scooped<00:04:23.860> er<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.700> actually

a scooped er and I actually

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.249 
a scooped er and I actually
that's<00:04:25.889> how<00:04:26.039> close<00:04:26.249> we<00:04:26.520> came<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:27.030> making<00:04:27.719> them

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
that's how close we came to making them

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.209 
that's how close we came to making them
pay<00:04:28.680> for<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:30.120> glitchy<00:04:30.749> start<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.680> we<00:04:32.039> have

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:32.219 
pay for that glitchy start but we have

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.790 
pay for that glitchy start but we have
another<00:04:32.849> opportunity<00:04:33.180> here<00:04:33.449> when<00:04:33.960> Matt

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
another opportunity here when Matt

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.589 
another opportunity here when Matt

requires you to score one from like

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.749 
requires you to score one from like
really<00:05:05.969> long<00:05:06.240> way<00:05:07.110> away<00:05:07.259> and<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:08.039> do<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.550> and

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
really long way away and I do that and

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
long shot and I made it to nil Liverpool

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.089 
long shot and I made it to nil Liverpool
as<00:05:15.029> dangerous<00:05:15.539> as<00:05:15.719> they<00:05:15.930> had<00:05:16.110> been<00:05:16.319> up<00:05:16.800> until

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
as dangerous as they had been up until

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.189 
as dangerous as they had been up until
that<00:05:17.400> point<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.819> just<00:05:17.849> crumbled<00:05:18.449> away<00:05:18.689> and<00:05:18.930> the

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
that point it just crumbled away and the

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.070 
that point it just crumbled away and the
floodgates<00:05:19.740> really<00:05:20.279> did<00:05:20.460> open<00:05:20.839> first<00:05:21.839> one<00:05:22.050> I

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
floodgates really did open first one I
