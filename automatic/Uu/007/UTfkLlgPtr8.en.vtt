backed up what I believe in and I man

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.580 
backed up what I believe in and I man
I'm<00:01:41.219> a<00:01:41.280> living<00:01:41.549> proof<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:43.109> need<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I'm a living proof that that we need to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.170 
I'm a living proof that that we need to
eat<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.219> way<00:01:44.369> our<00:01:44.520> bodies<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.969> silent

eat the way our bodies at the silent

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
eat the way our bodies at the silent
because<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> body<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.560> heals

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
because then the body just heals

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.669 
because then the body just heals
everything<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> body<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:48.000> feel<00:01:48.210> everything

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
everything the body can feel everything

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.169 
everything the body can feel everything
we<00:01:49.679> don't<00:01:49.829> let<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.609> put<00:01:50.729> junk<00:01:51.000> in
