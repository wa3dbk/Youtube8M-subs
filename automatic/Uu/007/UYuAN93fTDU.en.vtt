00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.667
 End of the match 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 Guys, now we'll go to Tokyo on the slack. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.267
 Never before has such a long flight made me so happy. Of course yes... 

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.333
 Don Andrés, you're right as always! 

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:24.433
 Because I think I will spend the whole trip asking about the most private matters ... 

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.933
 And I will not stop until I know the size of your pants. We will have a great time! 

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.600
 We will have a great time! We will have a great time! 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.200
 With the boss, with Puyol, with Xavi, with everyone! 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.100
 Sayonara Madrid, to Japan! 

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.933
 This failure is a lack of happiness. 

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:49.400
 We had very bad luck. A ladder stood in front of the bench, and it all happened through her. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.133
 But there is nothing at the bench. 

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:55.100
 I am telling you that there is a ladder in front of the bench. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.133
 You see? 

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:03.633
 For this I am sure that Karanka again did not change his shirt and it also brought us bad luck. 

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.233
 I? No. 

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.200
 Well, again. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.900
 And a mirror came to us. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.067
 That's because these cheapies played like wood! 

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:15.300
 What a happiness that I have you! 

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:18.400
 You see? 

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.733
 Luśterećko! Broken! 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.500
 1, 2, 3, breathe! 

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:29.400
 I'm gonna get them to the police. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.633
 Sure, I will save you. 

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:37.967
 Are you sure they are not excuses? 

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:40.500
 No, it's bad luck. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.370
 And the end of the questions, we'll see you at a press conference. Peszek. 

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.070
 We're going Karanka! 

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.900
 I will say something, but it will probably be politically incorrect, but I would say that ... 

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:57.630
 We kicked their butts. We kicked their butts! 

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:04.630
 Damn, but it's good to say things that are politically incorrect. Let's try something else ... 

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.530
 Mourinho is enchantment! 

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:14.300
 And "Floren" Florentino has a stinky breath. 

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.370
 And Messi is a dwarf. 

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.200
 And Artur Mas showed his butt to take a picture with me. 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.570
 And it's better that Urdangarin does not play at all and Barça **. 

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:32.470
 And Guardiola, oh old man, now be careful, okay, Guardiola is not friends, but really ...
