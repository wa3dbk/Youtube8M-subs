core it's all hopped up on carbon all

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.320 
core it's all hopped up on carbon all
over<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> place<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.379> kinds<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> other

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
over the place all kinds of other

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
over the place all kinds of other
materials<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.040> whole

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
materials in here and they do a whole

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
materials in here and they do a whole
lot<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.880> making<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:09.299> ride<00:01:09.630> pretty

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
lot for making this thing ride pretty

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.890 
lot for making this thing ride pretty
sweet<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.770> first<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.450> there's<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.570> array<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
sweet so first off there's an array of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.420 
sweet so first off there's an array of
carbon<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.770> call<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> carbon<00:01:14.340> array

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
carbon they call it the carbon array

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.510 
carbon they call it the carbon array
it's<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> web<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.470> X's<00:01:16.950> kind

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it's kind of just like a web of X's kind

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's kind of just like a web of X's kind
of<00:01:17.580> splinters<00:01:17.939> off<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.270> these<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.540> pieces

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of splinters off all these little pieces

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
of splinters off all these little pieces
of<00:01:18.960> carbon<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.950> tip<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> tail<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
of carbon in the tip and the tail and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
of carbon in the tip and the tail and
what<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> does<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.710> stiffens<00:01:23.100> up

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
what that does is kind of stiffens up

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
what that does is kind of stiffens up
those<00:01:23.520> zones<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.869> gives<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> lot<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> snap

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
those zones it gives you a lot of snap

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.990 
those zones it gives you a lot of snap
also<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> helps<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:26.729> some

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
also kind of helps you put down some

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
also kind of helps you put down some
landings<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:28.110> also<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.710> compliments

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
landings it also kind of a compliments

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270 
landings it also kind of a compliments
the<00:01:29.850> camber<00:01:30.509> profile<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.200> board<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the camber profile on this board so this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
the camber profile on this board so this
board<00:01:32.460> has<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> camber<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.810> positive

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
board has bit of camber just positive

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.649 
board has bit of camber just positive
camber<00:01:34.409> around<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> insert<00:01:35.640> packs<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.180> then

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
camber around the insert packs and then

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
camber around the insert packs and then
rides<00:01:36.930> low-rise<00:01:37.409> rocker<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
rides low-rise rocker so it's a really

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
rides low-rise rocker so it's a really
gentle<00:01:38.820> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> flat<00:01:39.689> rocker<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> goes<00:01:40.320> out

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
gentle kind of flat rocker that goes out

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.830 
gentle kind of flat rocker that goes out
from<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> tips<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.729> anytime<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
from the tips so anytime you have you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
from the tips so anytime you have you
know<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.320> lifted<00:01:43.680> area<00:01:44.009> you're

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know kind of that lifted area you're

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
know kind of that lifted area you're
kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> losing<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.299> response<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.290> I'm

that's what skate wheels are made out of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.320 
that's what skate wheels are made out of
and<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:20.070> absorbs<00:02:20.490> its<00:02:20.850> kind<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.120> hard
