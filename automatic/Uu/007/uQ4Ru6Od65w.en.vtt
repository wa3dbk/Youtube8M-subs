klay<00:00:04.140> Thompson<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.069> think<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.120> actually<00:00:06.600> a

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
klay Thompson I think this is actually a

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830 
klay Thompson I think this is actually a
better<00:00:07.200> example<00:00:07.529> than<00:00:08.330> Anthony<00:00:09.330> Davis

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
better example than Anthony Davis

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.749 
better example than Anthony Davis
because<00:00:10.849> no<00:00:11.849> stats<00:00:12.300> go<00:00:12.660> down<00:00:12.960> from<00:00:13.650> emerald<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
because no stats go down from emerald to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.960 
because no stats go down from emerald to
Ruby<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.900> nothing<00:00:16.529> goes<00:00:16.560> down<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.640> either

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
Ruby like nothing goes down is either

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.529 
Ruby like nothing goes down is either
the<00:00:18.119> same<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.890> increase<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:21.000> stand<00:00:21.420> in

the same or increase and I stand in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.170 
the same or increase and I stand in

standing 397 standing three but on top

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.679 
standing 397 standing three but on top
of<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.810> he's<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:29.070> Ruby<00:00:29.490> compared<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> M

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
of that he's the Ruby compared to the M

better player no and again no stats went
down<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.210> it's<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.420> everything<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
down at all it's just everything is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.799 
down at all it's just everything is
increase<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.879> supposed<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
increase the way it's supposed to be and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.170 
increase the way it's supposed to be and
the<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.260> everybody<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> see

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the way everybody really want to see

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.810 
the way everybody really want to see
when<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> ruby<00:00:52.649> card<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.309> compare<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
when they get a ruby card and compare it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.770 
when they get a ruby card and compare it
to<00:00:53.969> another<00:00:54.120> card<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:56.270> obviously<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.390> would<00:00:57.660> say

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
to another card so obviously I would say

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.720 
to another card so obviously I would say
the<00:00:57.960> ruby<00:00:58.320> emerald<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.760> silver<00:01:00.620> but

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
the ruby emerald and then silver but

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
the ruby emerald and then silver but
Emery<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.760> pretty<00:01:03.090> good<00:01:03.270> too<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
Emery was pretty good too so if you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.250 
Emery was pretty good too so if you
could<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.129> hands<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:06.260> there

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
could get your hands on that there

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
could get your hands on that there
wouldn't<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> bad<00:01:07.830> pick<00:01:08.100> up
