00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.500
 or launched the kaiser and let's see how 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.690
 draw facial expressions and how 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.510
 I always say it's always going to depend 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.210
 of the style of drawing if it is more realistic 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.850
 less realistic but fortunately in 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.500
 how much facial expressions all fall 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.780
 in the same bag or the same way 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.490
 draw them so clarify that to 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.010
 difference of the face with expressions 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.620
 human one can know the feelings 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.100
 of people not only because of the expression 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.420
 that you put but by the voice by the tone and 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.239
 also for different circumstances 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.920
 how the moment changes the comic 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.350
 we have to pass the logo part of 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 text on the face like the days and you 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.109
 angry is sad but being like 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.610
 draw let's see credited the symbol that 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:54.310
 draw on the face without the body 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.950
 then they saw that without drawing all 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.290
 the elements of the face finally 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.710
 everyone can realize the attitude that 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.440
 has this face that I just drew in 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.940
 this case is a little angry then 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.940
 is that we can get out of this 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.480
 than to draw the face or especially 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 to draw expressions we're going to 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.760
 Basically based on three elements 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.760
 the eyes the mouth and the eyebrows 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.280
 then we can add the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.710
 details to that drawing for example the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.050
 typical sweat drop blush on the face 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.740
 that typical come expose and tell more 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.630
 angry and ready but the main one or the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.040
 skeleton of when we want to draw 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.230
 Social expressions are the mouth the eye 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.230
 eyes and eyebrows 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 they saw the happy face and we give ourselves 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.939
 count thanks of all three elements 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.090
 that make up the face we do not count the 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.090
 nose do not count the ears alone is with 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.100
 that 's easy and they're going to tell the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.299
 reader the face that the character has or 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.250
 be the expression you are putting 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.860
 let's remember the eyes and the eyes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.599
 already with that we can go arming what 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.959
 will be the facial expressions within 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.750
 characters and obviously it 's just 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.700
 practical practice and much practice 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.250
 I will recommend that you do so draw the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.519
 faces and draw a thousand ways to draw 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.260
 eyes and face is like the emoticons not 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.140
 they give us good just try to draw 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.480
 as they did here soaked producers 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.300
 remember that when they are impressions 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.319
 usually generally it surprises 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.750
 the eyes are open and when one 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.300
 he is more angry or thoughtful when he is 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.300
 more generally self-absorbed the eyes are 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.310
 he draws them between closed and mouth by 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.470
 example closed and change with that emotion 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.780
 usually to portray more language 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.430
 with an open mouth 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.900
 the eyebrows obviously you will give 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.340
 angry account curves and are happy 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.250
 open 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.200
 Juve version practice draw faces 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.510
 draw a thousand ways to draw candy 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.250
 for die go out just perfect for 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.620
 Talk about your own expressions with 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.840
 these three elements 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.970
 well now let's show you with those 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.310
 Three different elements style 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.650
 more or less realistic drawing and you 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.720
 you can base it if I have my face ready 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.940
 for that is the head ready to put 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.590
 the depressions and up I'm going to put what 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.810
 type of print I want to put on this 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.810
 case once surprise one of doubts 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.010
 / As I said we started with the mouth in 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.510
 this case if you do not know what to say is 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.870
 hesitant we can from a mouth 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.870
 half-open 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.770
 the eyes are going to be fairly large 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.930
 for the surprise but also in another 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.630
 that depends kind of surprise because it's not 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.550
 a surprise, fairly 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.860
 embarrassing so to speak are eyes 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.840
 big 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.990
 and when I come out shock to something that 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.640
 bothers what impresses for evil in 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.090
 the extent to which draw the eyes very 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.090
 Boys 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.019
 as I said when it 's surprise then 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.760
 the eyes have to be very open 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.110
 open 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.110
 the same eyebrows 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.130
 well we already have an expression then 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.740
 drawn when the drawing style more 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.419
 detailed is wanted 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.280
 remember back which three 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.790
 important elements 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.490
 the eyes and the eyebrows can then go 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.200
 adding details like the drop blush 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.820
 Sweat settler who is a comic or 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.520
 cartoon can use those 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.500
 visual resources that in real life do not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.080
 they look like the typical drops stick out 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.080
 cost the hatches of anger and so on 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.840
 for example it was written with a face 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.030
 angry generally or thoughtful and it 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.890
 wants the eyes to come down closer and the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.890
 mouth mouth to put closed 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.060
 and the eyes as I said more closed not so 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.060
 open and eyebrows accompany this 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.740
 they saw fits any style of 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.210
 I draw what I just told you to draw 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.159
 more of your more detailed human body 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.830
 less detailed human body more 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.659
 cartoony and ready they can 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.310
 vary and create different expressions 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:41.340
 Open guys or concentrated open mouth 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.870
 eyebrows etcetera good I'm called Caixa and 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.830

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.830
 practices and practices
