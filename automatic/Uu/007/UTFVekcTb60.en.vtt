00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
we're just going to do a little blowing

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.540 
we're just going to do a little blowing
snow<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> stihl<00:01:00.750> BG<00:01:01.050> 55<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
snow with actually the stihl BG 55 this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
snow with actually the stihl BG 55 this
has<00:01:02.760> happened<00:01:03.180> started<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> month<00:01:04.439> since

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
has happened started over a month since

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.760 
has happened started over a month since
I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.560> I've

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
I think that would go on it and I've

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
I think that would go on it and I've
never<00:01:07.950> blown<00:01:08.250> snow<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.570> guess

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
never blown snow with it so I guess

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.030 
never blown snow with it so I guess
we'll<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.280> goes<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.619> people
