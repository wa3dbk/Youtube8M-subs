hello everybody and welcome to my little

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.260 
hello everybody and welcome to my little
showcase<00:00:03.480> today<00:00:04.100> today<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.279> want<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> present

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
showcase today today I want to present

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.740 
showcase today today I want to present
you<00:00:06.629> my<00:00:07.099> latest<00:00:08.099> invention<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.389> I'm<00:00:09.510> very

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
you my latest invention and I'm very

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.930 
you my latest invention and I'm very
proud<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.440> because<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.490> world's

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
proud of it because it's the world's

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.020 
proud of it because it's the world's
smallest<00:00:12.269> 7<00:00:13.110> segment<00:00:13.590> counter<00:00:14.160> correct<00:00:14.849> me<00:00:14.969> if

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
smallest 7 segment counter correct me if

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.359 
smallest 7 segment counter correct me if
i'm<00:00:15.240> wrong<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.719> i<00:00:15.900> guess<00:00:16.170> nobody<00:00:16.560> else<00:00:16.949> have

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
i'm wrong but i guess nobody else have

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.560 
i'm wrong but i guess nobody else have
made<00:00:18.770> it<00:00:19.770> such<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.580> small<00:00:21.529> display<00:00:22.529> counter

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
made it such a small display counter

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.880 
made it such a small display counter
because<00:00:24.570> normally<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.170> would<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.830> least

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
because normally you would have at least

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.000 
because normally you would have at least
two<00:00:26.880> blocks<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.359> between<00:00:27.720> that's<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.380> design

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
two blocks in between that's the design

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
two blocks in between that's the design
that<00:00:29.220> mo<00:00:29.400> jungle<00:00:29.820> did<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.390> piston<00:00:30.869> tape

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that mo jungle did with this piston tape

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.290 
that mo jungle did with this piston tape
he<00:00:31.769> had<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:32.009> blocks<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.399> between<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:33.059> came

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
he had two blocks in between and i came

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.990 
he had two blocks in between and i came
up<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.989> design<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.649> only<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.730> block

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
up with this design was only one block

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.139 
up with this design was only one block
in<00:00:36.180> between<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.730> yeah<00:00:38.730> let<00:00:38.910> me<00:00:39.000> demonstrate

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
in between and yeah let me demonstrate

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.780 
in between and yeah let me demonstrate
it<00:00:39.510> before<00:00:39.809> i<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.140> detail<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.610> i<00:00:41.700> hit

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
it before i go into detail so if i hit

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.450 
it before i go into detail so if i hit
the<00:00:41.850> switch<00:00:42.149> i<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.660> start<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.460> one-second

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the switch i will start a one-second

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.840 
the switch i will start a one-second
clock<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.809> count<00:00:46.020> upwards<00:00:46.760> what<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
clock and it will count upwards what you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.930 
clock and it will count upwards what you
can<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.710> goes<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
can see here is that it goes off for a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
can see here is that it goes off for a
spare<00:00:51.420> second<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.469> experience<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.699> if

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
spare second and I experience that if

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.560 
spare second and I experience that if
the<00:00:55.020> numbers<00:00:55.350> turn<00:00:55.710> off<00:00:56.010> before<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.090> next<00:00:57.300> one

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the numbers turn off before the next one

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
the numbers turn off before the next one
turns<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.559> animation<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.489> much<00:00:59.940> smoother

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
turns on the animation is much smoother

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
turns on the animation is much smoother
so<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> experience<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:03.059> animation<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so the experience with the animation is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
so the experience with the animation is
amiss<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.290> looser<00:01:05.000> also<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
amiss much looser also when you take a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.260 
amiss much looser also when you take a
look<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.770> jumping<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:09.200> 29<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.530> 230<00:01:11.270> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
look at the jumping from 29 now 230 you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.859 
look at the jumping from 29 now 230 you
can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.790> segments<00:01:14.790> will<00:01:15.479> jump

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
can see that these segments will jump

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.039 
can see that these segments will jump
over<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.439> exactly<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> same<00:01:17.460> time<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
over at exactly the same time so it's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
over at exactly the same time so it's
not<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:21.979> overflow<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:23.880> triggers

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
not a overflow from this which triggers

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.870 
not a overflow from this which triggers
this<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.680> synchronized<00:01:26.369> clock

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this one it's a synchronized clock

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.780 
this one it's a synchronized clock
between<00:01:27.420> behind<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.090> even<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:31.790> 999

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
between behind it so even if we at 999

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
between behind it so even if we at 999
this<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:34.020> flick<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:35.040> time<00:01:35.250> as

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this one will flick at the same time as

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
this one will flick at the same time as
all<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> others<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:37.170> using

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
all the others because they are using

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
all the others because they are using
the<00:01:37.680> same<00:01:37.950> clock<00:01:38.340> line<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.579> I<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.970> not

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the same clock line so and I can not

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.310 
the same clock line so and I can not
just<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.530> clock<00:01:44.250> running<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.869> also

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just have a clock running I can also

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.929 
just have a clock running I can also
yeah<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> course<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.590> put<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.939> tee

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
yeah of course if you want to put a tee

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.859 
yeah of course if you want to put a tee
flip-flop<00:01:51.450> next<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:53.119> can<00:01:54.119> make<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
flip-flop next to it so you can make a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
flip-flop next to it so you can make a
racetrack<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.619> example<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.250> stop<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> time

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
racetrack for example and stop the time

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.660 
racetrack for example and stop the time
and<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.350> can<00:01:58.350> also<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.310> want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> count

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and you can also if you want to count

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.539 
and you can also if you want to count
events<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.909> happen<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.100> hit<00:02:05.100> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
events that happen you can hit this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
events that happen you can hit this
button<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.060> use<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.049> info

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
button and use this for a info

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.839 
button and use this for a info
as<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:09.470> counter<00:02:10.470> at<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.920> counter<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.590> um

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
as a counter at what counter and um

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.699 
as a counter at what counter and um
what's<00:02:14.849> now<00:02:15.030> difficult<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.810> how<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> reset

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
what's now difficult is how to reset

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.030 
what's now difficult is how to reset
this<00:02:17.430> same<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.200> want<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:19.650> back

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
this same because if we want to go back

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.250 
this same because if we want to go back
to<00:02:20.390> 0000<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.520> we<00:02:23.520> would<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.840> wait<00:02:25.019> until

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
to 0000 and we would have to wait until

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.520 
to 0000 and we would have to wait until
it<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:26.360> 9999<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.599> we<00:02:27.720> don't<00:02:27.840> want<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.380> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it at 9999 and we don't want to do this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.850 
it at 9999 and we don't want to do this
so<00:02:29.160> i<00:02:29.190> put<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.790> reset<00:02:30.300> line<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> segment

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so i put in a reset line for the segment

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.550 
so i put in a reset line for the segment
so<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.420> hit<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.840> button<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.530> will<00:02:35.989> make<00:02:36.989> +1

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
so if I hit this button it will make +1

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.120 
so if I hit this button it will make +1
for<00:02:37.860> all<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.160> segments<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:39.810> this

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
for all the segments so I can do this

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.170 
for all the segments so I can do this
until<00:02:42.620> these<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.010> segment<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.850> nine

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
until these the segment here is at nine

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:55.340 
until these the segment here is at nine
let<00:02:46.110> me<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:54.209> now<00:02:54.420> got<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.989> one<00:02:55.200> at

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
let me do this so we now got this one at

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.650 
let me do this so we now got this one at
nine<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.190> one<00:02:56.370> at<00:02:56.519> nine<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.360> one<00:02:57.540> is

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
nine and this one at nine this one is

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.870 
nine and this one at nine this one is
only<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:58.019> five<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.709> i<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.610> press

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
only at five so i will have to press

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.340 
only at five so i will have to press
this<00:03:00.150> button<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:01.069> until<00:03:02.069> it's<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:04.170> nine

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
this button to until it's at the nine

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.680 
this button to until it's at the nine
and<00:03:04.620> now<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.519> see<00:03:05.700> only<00:03:05.940> these<00:03:06.330> two<00:03:06.390> are

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
and now you can see only these two are

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.199 
and now you can see only these two are
changing<00:03:07.049> cost<00:03:07.290> only<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.069> right<00:03:08.670> side<00:03:08.940> to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
changing cost only to the right side to

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.930 
changing cost only to the right side to
this<00:03:09.330> place<00:03:09.599> will<00:03:10.440> change<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.760> had

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
this place will change and now we had

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.289 
this place will change and now we had
nice<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.359> 999<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.410> i<00:03:13.829> can<00:03:14.280> hit<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:15.030> once

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
nice out 999 and i can hit this one once

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.550 
nice out 999 and i can hit this one once
and<00:03:15.590> all<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.859> displays<00:03:17.160> flip<00:03:17.940> back<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.560> so

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
and all the displays flip back to you so

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.099 
and all the displays flip back to you so
that's<00:03:19.980> pretty<00:03:20.250> neat<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.299> can<00:03:21.690> reset

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
that's pretty neat that you can reset

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.210 
that's pretty neat that you can reset
the<00:03:22.320> whole<00:03:22.560> thing<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:24.530> yeah<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:25.709> let's<00:03:25.890> take

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the whole thing and yeah now let's take

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.610 
the whole thing and yeah now let's take
a<00:03:26.280> look<00:03:26.400> at<00:03:26.730> what's<00:03:27.150> behind<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.780> because<00:03:28.350> that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
a look at what's behind it because that

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.050 
a look at what's behind it because that
might<00:03:29.130> interest<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:31.310> lot<00:03:32.310> i<00:03:32.549> guess<00:03:32.820> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
might interest you a lot i guess and

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.420 
might interest you a lot i guess and
that's<00:03:34.049> how<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.380> looks<00:03:34.560> like<00:03:34.769> from<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.130> back<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
that's how it looks like from the back I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.220 
that's how it looks like from the back I
know<00:03:35.579> it's<00:03:35.790> quite<00:03:36.299> expensive<00:03:36.540> with<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
know it's quite expensive with the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.050 
know it's quite expensive with the
hoppers<00:03:37.530> but<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.400> want<00:03:38.579> about<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
hoppers but if you want about this and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.809 
hoppers but if you want about this and
survivor<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:40.319> might<00:03:40.530> have<00:03:40.920> an<00:03:41.130> errand<00:03:41.549> farm

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
survivor you might have an errand farm

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.160 
survivor you might have an errand farm
then<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:43.350> not<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.920> expensive<00:03:44.220> anymore<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
then it's not that expensive anymore the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.840 
then it's not that expensive anymore the
design<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.500> mumbo<00:03:47.069> jumbo<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.609> talked

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
design of mumbo jumbo that I talked

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.449 
design of mumbo jumbo that I talked
about<00:03:47.940> earlier<00:03:48.120> was<00:03:48.900> 10<00:03:49.380> blocks<00:03:49.680> deep<00:03:50.100> so

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
about earlier was 10 blocks deep so

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.509 
about earlier was 10 blocks deep so
let's<00:03:50.670> see<00:03:50.910> two<00:03:51.630> three<00:03:52.109> four<00:03:52.530> five<00:03:52.889> six<00:03:53.340> seven

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
let's see two three four five six seven

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.259 
let's see two three four five six seven
eight<00:03:54.000> nine<00:03:54.359> ten<00:03:55.079> so<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.950> not<00:03:56.670> even<00:03:57.030> bigger

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
eight nine ten so it's not even bigger

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.410 
eight nine ten so it's not even bigger
to<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> bank<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.620> guess<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.670> smaller

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
to the bank and I guess it's a smaller

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.220 
to the bank and I guess it's a smaller
in<00:04:00.750> size<00:04:01.680> from<00:04:01.950> button<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.790> top<00:04:03.180> because<00:04:04.019> this

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
in size from button to top because this

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.349 
in size from button to top because this
one<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.560> 11<00:04:04.950> blocks<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.250> don't<00:04:05.430> know<00:04:05.549> how<00:04:06.209> much

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
one is 11 blocks I don't know how much

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.809 
one is 11 blocks I don't know how much
it<00:04:06.510> was<00:04:06.660> at<00:04:06.930> mama<00:04:07.260> dramas<00:04:07.560> design<00:04:07.859> but<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.670> can

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
it was at mama dramas design but you can

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.960 
it was at mama dramas design but you can
tell<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.569> is<00:04:09.720> quite<00:04:10.019> small<00:04:10.200> it's<00:04:10.970> completely

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
tell this is quite small it's completely

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.759 
tell this is quite small it's completely
silent<00:04:12.569> because<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.260> hot<00:04:13.410> button<00:04:13.560> and

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
silent because of the hot button and

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.140 
silent because of the hot button and
Papas<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.130> rubber<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.700> can't<00:04:15.000> hear

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
Papas and rubber so you can't hear

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.289 
Papas and rubber so you can't hear
anything<00:04:15.420> while<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.350> counting<00:04:17.100> no<00:04:17.760> Pistons

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
anything while it's counting no Pistons

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.280 
anything while it's counting no Pistons
need<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.660> fire<00:04:18.959> up

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
need to fire up

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.220 
need to fire up
and<00:04:20.910> let<00:04:21.910> me<00:04:22.030> show<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.270> over<00:04:22.510> here<00:04:22.630> at<00:04:22.990> the

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
and let me show you over here at the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.260 
and let me show you over here at the
senior<00:04:23.620> segment<00:04:24.010> how<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.310> red<00:04:24.700> stone<00:04:24.970> looks

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
senior segment how the red stone looks

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.620 
senior segment how the red stone looks
like<00:04:25.480> for<00:04:25.720> one<00:04:25.870> segment<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:27.010> we<00:04:27.160> got<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.760> reset

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
like for one segment so we got the reset

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.480 
like for one segment so we got the reset
line<00:04:28.870> down<00:04:29.170> here<00:04:29.200> that's<00:04:29.650> what<00:04:29.950> makes<00:04:30.220> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
line down here that's what makes the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.540 
line down here that's what makes the
reset<00:04:30.820> then<00:04:31.510> over<00:04:32.050> here<00:04:32.080> we<00:04:32.290> got<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.800> overflow

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
reset then over here we got the overflow

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.630 
reset then over here we got the overflow
for<00:04:34.540> when<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.470> goes<00:04:35.590> from<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.980> nine<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
for when it goes from the nine to the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.300 
for when it goes from the nine to the
zero<00:04:36.880> again<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:40.020> then<00:04:41.020> back<00:04:41.470> here<00:04:41.740> we<00:04:41.950> had<00:04:42.130> got

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
zero again and then back here we had got

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.470 
zero again and then back here we had got
our<00:04:42.840> data<00:04:43.840> tapes<00:04:44.350> built<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.370> with<00:04:45.760> hoppers<00:04:46.450> and

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
our data tapes built in with hoppers and

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.670 
our data tapes built in with hoppers and
drop<00:04:47.200> us<00:04:47.380> for<00:04:48.190> our<00:04:48.400> seven<00:04:49.360> segments<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.140> this

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
drop us for our seven segments and this

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.980 
drop us for our seven segments and this
will<00:04:52.170> swap<00:04:53.170> around<00:04:53.410> blocks<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.160> circle<00:04:54.610> and

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
will swap around blocks in a circle and

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.530 
will swap around blocks in a circle and
the<00:04:55.990> filling<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.800> these<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.520> quite<00:04:58.060> difficult

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
the filling of these is quite difficult

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.320 
the filling of these is quite difficult
so<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.680> see<00:04:59.890> we<00:05:00.070> got<00:05:00.280> different<00:05:00.760> items

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
so you can see we got different items

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.480 
so you can see we got different items
and<00:05:01.570> each<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:02.830> that's<00:05:03.160> why<00:05:03.340> I'm

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
and each of these so that's why I'm

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.400 
and each of these so that's why I'm
making<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.940> showcase<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.390> not<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.720> tutorial<00:05:04.810> at

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410
