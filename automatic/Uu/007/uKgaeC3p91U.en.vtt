00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
my fingers through and it's not tanoli

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.860 
my fingers through and it's not tanoli
and<00:05:40.219> which<00:05:40.339> is<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.550> miracle<00:05:40.909> for<00:05:41.360> me<00:05:41.419> because

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
and which is a miracle for me because

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.999 
and which is a miracle for me because
that<00:05:42.080> means<00:05:43.009> i<00:05:43.460> don't<00:05:43.490> need<00:05:43.879> um<00:05:45.009> conditioner

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
that means i don't need um conditioner

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.550 
that means i don't need um conditioner
and<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:46.520> maybe<00:05:46.759> that's<00:05:47.120> why<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.389> works<00:05:47.839> wonders

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
and so maybe that's why it works wonders

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.790 
and so maybe that's why it works wonders
I<00:05:48.889> don't<00:05:49.490> know<00:05:49.550> but<00:05:49.819> that's<00:05:50.719> a<00:05:50.900> big<00:05:51.139> plus<00:05:51.740> for

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
I don't know but that's a big plus for

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.850 
I don't know but that's a big plus for
me<00:05:52.129> not<00:05:52.659> needing<00:05:53.659> conditioner<00:05:54.319> because<00:05:54.440> this

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
me not needing conditioner because this

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.309 
me not needing conditioner because this
