abducted<00:00:21.090> engine<00:00:21.420> boost<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.560> power<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
abducted engine boost is power so you

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
abducted engine boost is power so you
want<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> make<00:00:23.550> sure<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.570> system<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.019> not

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
want to make sure that the system is not

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.380 
want to make sure that the system is not
leaking<00:00:25.740> air<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.609> losing<00:00:26.970> boost

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
leaking air because if it's losing boost

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
leaking air because if it's losing boost
it's<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.869> losing<00:00:28.260> power<00:00:28.429> depending

it's going to be losing power depending

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
it's going to be losing power depending
on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> system<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.119> how<00:00:30.210> its<00:00:30.390> set<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.630> having

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
a boost leak is detrimental in a few

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.770 
a boost leak is detrimental in a few
different<00:00:33.149> ways

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
different ways

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.299 
different ways
on<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.050> turbocharged<00:00:34.649> car<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
on a turbocharged car if you have a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
on a turbocharged car if you have a
loose<00:00:35.579> leak<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> turbocharger<00:00:36.780> will<00:00:36.899> just

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
loose leak the turbocharger will just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
loose leak the turbocharger will just
speed<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:38.160> meet<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> same<00:00:38.730> boost<00:00:39.000> target

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990 
speed up to meet the same boost target
most<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> time<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.640> that's<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
most of the time and that's going to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
most of the time and that's going to
increase<00:00:42.300> back<00:00:42.660> pressure<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> workload

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
increase back pressure and the workload

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
increase back pressure and the workload
on<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> turbocharger<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.180> addition<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> that

run<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.460> order<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.150> test

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
run as well so in order to do this test

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.109 
run as well so in order to do this test
you're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:16.110> yourself<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> tool<00:01:17.119> or

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you're going to make yourself a tool or

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.340 
you're going to make yourself a tool or
if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.659> probably<00:01:18.840> purchase<00:01:19.259> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
if you can probably purchase this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530 
if you can probably purchase this
through<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> vendor<00:01:19.890> online<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> idea<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
through a vendor online but the idea is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620 
through a vendor online but the idea is
to<00:01:22.040> cap<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.340> inlet<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.939> turbocharger<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to cap the inlet of the turbocharger and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.499 
to cap the inlet of the turbocharger and
fill<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> system<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.860> air<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.729> start

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
fill the system with air and then start

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.440 
fill the system with air and then start
fishing<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.320> air<00:01:28.590> leaks<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:30.299> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
fishing around for air leaks so you can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
fishing around for air leaks so you can
use<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> spray<00:01:31.500> bottle<00:01:31.710> full<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.159> soapy<00:01:32.490> water

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
use a spray bottle full of soapy water

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
use a spray bottle full of soapy water
you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> smoke<00:01:34.020> machine<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
you can use the smoke machine if you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
you can use the smoke machine if you
have<00:01:34.710> access<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.700> use<00:01:36.030> your

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
have access to that or just use your

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230 
have access to that or just use your
ears<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.990> quiet<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> unless<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.000> an

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
ears if it's quiet so unless you have an

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
ears if it's quiet so unless you have an
engine<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> tremendous<00:01:40.590> amount<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
engine that has a tremendous amount of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
engine that has a tremendous amount of
overlap<00:01:41.159> where<00:01:41.759> both<00:01:42.000> valves<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.600> open<00:01:42.840> at

overlap where both valves are open at

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
overlap where both valves are open at
the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.549> feed<00:01:44.850> air<00:01:45.030> into

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the same time you can just feed air into

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460 
the same time you can just feed air into
the<00:01:45.530> turbocharger<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.759> just<00:01:47.759> listen<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the turbocharger and just listen if you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
the turbocharger and just listen if you
need<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> use<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> spray<00:01:50.729> bottle<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.180> some

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
need to use a spray bottle with some

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
need to use a spray bottle with some
soap<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> spray

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
