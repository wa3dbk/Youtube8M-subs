that's looking like pure now these I've
tried<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> mix<00:00:26.880> more<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:27.810> less<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.230> tone

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
okay so I've done about an inch there I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.660 
okay so I've done about an inch there I
had<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.680> first<00:01:23.979> bit<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.220> yellow<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:26.490> we'll<00:01:27.490> just

had a first bit of yellow and we'll just
keep<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.000> water<00:01:28.180> coming<00:01:28.570> down<00:01:30.930> again<00:01:31.930> this<00:01:32.290> is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
keep the water coming down again this is

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.450 
keep the water coming down again this is
all<00:01:32.560> about<00:01:32.650> been<00:01:32.950> quite<00:01:33.190> quick<00:01:33.490> more<00:01:33.970> yellow

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
all about been quite quick more yellow

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.050 
all about been quite quick more yellow
mix<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:39.540> apply<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.600> again<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.410> keep<00:01:41.650> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
mix it and apply it again just keep that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.820 
mix it and apply it again just keep that
line<00:01:43.060> moving<00:01:43.090> because<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.869> don't<00:01:44.050> want<00:01:44.229> to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
line moving because we don't want to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.060 
line moving because we don't want to
create<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.160> sort<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.700> sediment<00:01:46.180> line<00:01:46.890> say<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.009> a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
create a sort of sediment line say it a

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.840 
create a sort of sediment line say it a
million<00:01:48.250> times

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
million times

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.160 
million times
the<00:01:49.030> fussy<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.630> paint<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.140> better<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.899> now<00:01:53.110> we

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
the fussy can paint the better so now we

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.460 
the fussy can paint the better so now we
can<00:01:53.440> see<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.979> we're<00:01:54.790> really<00:01:54.940> getting<00:01:55.120> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
can see that we're really getting it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.300 
can see that we're really getting it
sort<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.530> changing<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:58.290> wash<00:01:59.290> color<00:01:59.680> now

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.060 

more<00:02:03.310> yellow<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:08.200> all<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.500> time<00:02:08.739> as<00:02:08.920> we're

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
more yellow and all the time as we're

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.940 
more yellow and all the time as we're
using<00:02:09.100> up<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.580> paint<00:02:09.820> in<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> glass<00:02:10.299> here<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
using up the paint in the glass here the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.740 
using up the paint in the glass here the
yellow<00:02:12.130> adding<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.760> sort<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.000> accelerating

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
yellow adding is sort of accelerating

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.660 
yellow adding is sort of accelerating
the<00:02:13.870> speed<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.680> turns<00:02:14.950> from<00:02:15.280> blue<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the speed that it turns from blue to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.539 
the speed that it turns from blue to
yellow<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.000> makes<00:02:16.480> any<00:02:16.660> sense<00:02:17.459> because<00:02:18.459> all

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
yellow that makes any sense because all

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.750 
yellow that makes any sense because all
the<00:02:18.700> time<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.120> less<00:02:19.360> blue<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:24.519> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
the time is less blue in the in the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.120 
the time is less blue in the in the
glass<00:02:25.049> we'd<00:02:26.049> have<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.230> go<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.380> long<00:02:26.620> way<00:02:26.799> before

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
glass we'd have to go a long way before

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.680 
glass we'd have to go a long way before
we<00:02:27.250> turned<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.580> into<00:02:27.700> pure<00:02:27.970> yeah<00:02:28.180> that's<00:02:28.540> not

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
we turned it into pure yeah that's not

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.570 
we turned it into pure yeah that's not
going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> happen<00:02:29.019> we're<00:02:30.010> gonna<00:02:30.130> end<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.430> with

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
going to happen we're gonna end up with

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.320 
going to happen we're gonna end up with
this<00:02:30.700> sort<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.940> light<00:02:31.570> yellowy<00:02:31.989> green<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
this sort of light yellowy green you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.550 
this sort of light yellowy green you
know<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.570> theory<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.110> kept<00:02:35.290> darling

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
know in theory if you kept darling

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.870 
know in theory if you kept darling
yellow<00:02:35.830> forever<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.400> would<00:02:36.519> end<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:36.820> with

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
yellow forever you would end up with

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.080 
yellow forever you would end up with
yellows<00:02:40.980> okay<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.400> wash<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.610> down

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
yellows okay so just wash that down

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.839 
yellows okay so just wash that down
there

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.160 

last<00:02:48.849> bit<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.090> yellow<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:50.260> go<00:02:50.670> mix<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.849> up

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
last bit of yellow and we go mix it up

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
last bit of yellow and we go mix it up
now<00:02:53.170> I'll<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.319> complete<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.010> wash<00:02:56.190> oops

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
now I'll just complete that wash oops

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.320

see if we can spot a couple of things so

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.070 
see if we can spot a couple of things so
there's<00:05:45.470> my<00:05:45.970> original<00:05:47.740> blue<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:49.160> yellow<00:05:50.080> we

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
there's my original blue and yellow we

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.710 
there's my original blue and yellow we
have<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.230> graded<00:05:51.680> wash<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:53.300> look<00:05:53.450> at<00:05:53.570> this

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
have the graded wash and look at this

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.830 
have the graded wash and look at this
line<00:05:53.960> here<00:05:54.440> looks<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:55.490> much<00:05:55.610> brighter<00:05:55.850> and<00:05:56.720> it

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
line here looks so much brighter and it

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.900 
line here looks so much brighter and it
does<00:05:56.990> appear<00:05:57.139> I<00:05:57.650> said<00:05:58.190> it<00:05:58.310> mix<00:05:58.460> those<00:05:58.669> two

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
does appear I said it mix those two

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.300 
does appear I said it mix those two
colors<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.330> same<00:05:59.570> tone<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.110> they<00:06:00.380> are<00:06:00.530> it

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
colors the same tone and they are it

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.920 
colors the same tone and they are it
just<00:06:01.340> looks<00:06:01.700> like<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:02.120> because<00:06:02.389> of<00:06:02.479> the<00:06:02.570> darker

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
just looks like it because of the darker

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.260 
just looks like it because of the darker
pink<00:06:03.139> in<00:06:03.740> front<00:06:04.040> of<00:06:04.160> it<00:06:04.250> they<00:06:04.490> are<00:06:04.700> actually

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
pink in front of it they are actually

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.850 
pink in front of it they are actually
