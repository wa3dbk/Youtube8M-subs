00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:18.000
 Speak people, I got here today. Hi, I brought 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.970
 a cool idea that is a cookie of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 Parsnip with orange 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.400
 then that practical recipe to make and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.170
 It does in a few minutes and you'll love it. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 a lot of people I have basically clear 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 Wheat flour and flour 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.320
 brown nut 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 so if you can not find the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.180
 stop brown flour can pick up the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 matter of stopping the stop and grate one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.020
 which is the best option for 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.989
 I do not want to talk to Diego. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.399
 in the coach I can suddenly crush the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 Brazil nuts to get the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 flour would not be the most suitable but 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.010
 in this case you can try to work out 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.690
 so first I'm going to sift the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.320
 brown nut flour 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.360
 the sugar and the flour aside and then I 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.640
 I'm going to hit the clear in snow. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.229
 so let's keep a close eye on the people 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.220
 It's going to make you here to see what it's like. 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.220
 what is the point of doing 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.310
 clear tabatinga in snow is no longer 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.410
 just a very firm point 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.330
 Now I'll kiss you the mixture here. 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.720
 I have wheat flour 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.750
 Brazil nuts and sugar 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.700
 You do not have to wait for everything at the end. 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.580
 mass will get a little heavier 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.240
 in her natural way there will not be a mass 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.710
 as is the entrance and then finally to the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.470
 end of the mix to give a touch 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.540
 different we place scrapings 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.540
 orange and orange chips or scrapings 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.680
 Lemon so much mixes well then I 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:18.880
 I said stay a heavy mass is one 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.950
 texture is here now I go 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.820
 transfer to the confectionery bag to 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.340
 keep the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.980
 now with the dough already ready in a 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.390
 always remembering that if 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.430
 do not you have a bag of 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.250
 Confectionary can work with spoons 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.330
 that gives the result will be yes there it is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.220
 here the model looking at polka dots 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.170
 here I have a silicone carpet if 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.400
 do not have the upholsterer icon can also 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.000
 be on a sheet of buttered paper 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.330
 no problem took her here some 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.549
 similar sized balls 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.410
 for who makes brown this mass here she 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.540
 It reminds me a little of the pasta 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.140
 only that the final result is completely 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.760
 different from law and then I come 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.790
 here in the case as I put 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.430
 orange in the mass here I have orange 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.739
 crystallized to place on the surface 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.110
 if it was lemon and put the hand and so 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:16.000
 We will're putting here a little 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.100
 on top was a very large piece 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.959
 can cut in the century in size there 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.820
 they almost simulated that you changed 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.720
 I put it over here and I'll take it to the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.300
 oven heated in the range of 1 180 degrees 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.630
 for about a 12 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.460
 - two minutes is the ideal is one thing 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.410
 that it is important to emphasize the 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.990
 oven temperature 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.330
 it is not standard for all forums and 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.160
 so each each were have a kind of 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.930
 heating is one thing that they were 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.420
 are different from each other then 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.520
 you will be based on speech but not on 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.930
 follow to the letter what the oven I have 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.150
 here is different from the background you have 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.520
 at home at work or finish 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.020
 put here next so that after 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.740
 we see the final result of this 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.790
 play dough 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.110
 so we have here our past is 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.940
 have here 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.820
 still in the form have here a form of 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.270
 presentation and while you analyze 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.150
 there is my faithful companion's mile 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.209
 we will prove to you and better for me 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.620
 glad that those who wait there 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.900
 have enjoyed 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.230
