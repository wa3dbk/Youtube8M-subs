00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
long film was in 1972

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.729 
long film was in 1972
and<00:02:12.799> for<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.700> year<00:02:14.060> or<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:15.079> did<00:02:15.409> both

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
and for a year or so I I did both

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.949 
and for a year or so I I did both
dancing<00:02:16.609> and<00:02:16.939> filmmaking<00:02:17.569> well<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.870> think

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
dancing and filmmaking well I think

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.140 
dancing and filmmaking well I think
that's<00:02:18.140> an<00:02:18.290> interesting<00:02:18.469> sort<00:02:19.069> of<00:02:19.189> baseline

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
that's an interesting sort of baseline

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.119 
that's an interesting sort of baseline
to<00:02:20.510> start<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:20.989> because<00:02:22.989> dance<00:02:24.129> obviously

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
to start with because dance obviously

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.309 
to start with because dance obviously
has<00:02:25.219> an<00:02:25.340> affinity<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:25.849> film<00:02:26.420> or<00:02:26.689> film<00:02:26.989> has<00:02:27.200> an

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
has an affinity for film or film has an

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.920 
has an affinity for film or film has an
affinity<00:02:27.560> for<00:02:27.769> dance<00:02:28.219> and<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.359> think<00:02:29.599> if<00:02:29.689> people

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
affinity for dance and I think if people

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.690 
affinity for dance and I think if people
know<00:02:30.109> that<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.469> were<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.769> dancer<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.519> that<00:02:31.609> you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
know that you were a dancer and that you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.550 
know that you were a dancer and that you
were<00:02:31.879> a<00:02:31.909> choreographer<00:02:32.719> that<00:02:32.989> they<00:02:33.139> can<00:02:33.319> then

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
were a choreographer that they can then

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.520 
were a choreographer that they can then
see<00:02:33.889> your<00:02:34.129> film<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.579> terms<00:02:34.879> of<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.530> context

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
see your film in terms of that context

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.160 
see your film in terms of that context
of<00:02:36.709> movement<00:02:37.549> kinesthesia<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.719> so<00:02:38.930> forth

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
of movement kinesthesia and so forth

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.099 
of movement kinesthesia and so forth
yeah<00:02:39.409> I<00:02:39.620> happen<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.549> think<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.689> the<00:02:41.930> film

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
yeah I happen to think that the film

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.629 
yeah I happen to think that the film
that<00:02:42.230> Christina<00:02:42.590> talking<00:02:42.980> pictures<00:02:43.370> which<00:02:43.519> is

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
that Christina talking pictures which is

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.979 
that Christina talking pictures which is
the<00:02:43.760> film<00:02:43.969> that<00:02:44.060> we're<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.359> to<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.629> dealing

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
the film that we're going to be dealing

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.679 
the film that we're going to be dealing
with<00:02:45.019> today<00:02:45.549> doesn't<00:02:46.549> show<00:02:46.760> much<00:02:47.030> evidence<00:02:47.569> of

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
with today doesn't show much evidence of

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.809 
with today doesn't show much evidence of
your<00:02:47.840> having<00:02:48.019> been<00:02:48.139> a<00:02:48.260> dancer<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.010> let's<00:02:49.669> talk

other kinds of improv visit Ori groups
that<00:03:13.909> is<00:03:14.569> not<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.260> traditional<00:03:15.439> kind<00:03:16.280> of

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
that is not the traditional kind of

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.369 
that is not the traditional kind of
acting<00:03:17.150> or<00:03:17.389> traditional<00:03:17.810> kind<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.169> film

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
acting or traditional kind of film

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.229 
acting or traditional kind of film
acting<00:03:18.829> liver<00:03:19.129> which<00:03:19.310> really<00:03:19.579> develops<00:03:20.060> out

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
acting liver which really develops out

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.659 
acting liver which really develops out
of<00:03:20.419> life<00:03:20.989> itself<00:03:21.409> a<00:03:21.709> series<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:22.010> rhythms<00:03:22.459> and

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
of life itself a series of rhythms and

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.180 
of life itself a series of rhythms and
pulses<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.359> movements<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.229> spatial

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
pulses and movements and spatial

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.770 
pulses and movements and spatial
relationships<00:03:25.909> and<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.239> think<00:03:26.479> that's<00:03:26.599> one<00:03:26.750> of

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
relationships and I think that's one of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.559 
relationships and I think that's one of
the<00:03:26.900> more<00:03:26.959> intriguing<00:03:27.709> things<00:03:28.189> about

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
the more intriguing things about

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.729 
the more intriguing things about
Christina<00:03:29.569> talking<00:03:29.930> pictures<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.709> think

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
Christina talking pictures and I think

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.649 
Christina talking pictures and I think
the<00:03:31.040> background<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.549> served<00:03:31.909> very<00:03:32.060> well<00:03:32.239> here

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
the background is served very well here

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.360 
the background is served very well here
let<00:03:33.319> me<00:03:33.409> just<00:03:33.560> add<00:03:33.709> one<00:03:33.979> thing<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:35.989> first

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
let me just add one thing in this first

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.000 
let me just add one thing in this first
sequence<00:03:37.419> you'll<00:03:38.419> see<00:03:38.629> a<00:03:38.659> fragmentation<00:03:39.530> of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
sequence you'll see a fragmentation of

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.159 
sequence you'll see a fragmentation of
the<00:03:40.849> body<00:03:41.060> you'll<00:03:41.299> see<00:03:41.419> the<00:03:41.540> camera<00:03:41.900> as<00:03:42.019> an

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
the body you'll see the camera as an

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.890 
the body you'll see the camera as an
independent<00:03:45.310> unit<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:46.879> relation<00:03:47.419> to<00:03:47.540> movement

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
independent unit in relation to movement

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.679 
independent unit in relation to movement
and<00:03:48.229> that<00:03:48.349> was<00:03:49.189> as<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.549> dancer<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.449> what

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
and that was as a dancer that is what

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.330 
and that was as a dancer that is what
one<00:03:51.169> of<00:03:51.229> the<00:03:51.319> first<00:03:51.500> things<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.739> fascinated

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
one of the first things that fascinated

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.849 
one of the first things that fascinated
me<00:03:52.579> about<00:03:52.759> the<00:03:53.180> possibilities<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.810> cinema<00:03:54.409> for

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
me about the possibilities of cinema for

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.909 
me about the possibilities of cinema for
a<00:03:54.889> fragmenting<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.329> close-up<00:03:57.229> that<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.829> was

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
a fragmenting and close-up that it was

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.339 
a fragmenting and close-up that it was
not<00:03:58.069> available<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.669> me<00:03:58.790> as<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.000> performer

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.409 

carefully<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.739> mean<00:04:04.030> in<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.209> first

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
carefully that I mean in the first

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.610 
carefully that I mean in the first
segment<00:04:05.689> you<00:04:05.930> have<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:06.109> little<00:04:06.290> bit<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.560> a

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
segment you have a little bit of a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.839
