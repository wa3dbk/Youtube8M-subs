00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 hi everyone and welcome back to mine 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.099
 parry cooking by chance and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.890
 for passion 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.360
 today cauliflower clean basic cooking 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.590
 cook and confirm 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.600
 let's see what the hell I do 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.810
 it is very simple then we begin ad 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.450
 raise the course below 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.570
 clearly gr has raised all the leaves 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.760
 then we raise the expert leaves e 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.620
 we raise most of the course there is 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.470
 then if there are any specks he can 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.629
 happen that you have kept it and yes 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.519
 they are made of other TVs with a lot of 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.410
 patience and high until you do 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.080
 the white comes out but I recommend it then 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.510
 now you see these are flowers 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.390
 writes is nothing easier 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.219
 we take our rivers with water and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.230
 continuously if quietly 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.110
 serenely complicated if you see that 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:14.570
 tenacity and lives with a knife 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:17.479
 so you see them the rare effects more like 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.810
 you want to call it and keep it up 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.899
 as long as we have not seen all the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 our case you see it here we divide them a 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.990
 but no 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.010
 if you want smaller ones than you 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.439
 in this way and keep it up then 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.450
 let's go to work we put it between 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.729
 in the water they make him stay a dozen 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.729
 of minutes and he succeeded we open 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.530
 easy as the cable nothing 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.470
 complicated 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.700
 here you see now we put it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.430
 in the water and one can stand it 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380
 recent omitted in the water now 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 make the ten minutes the shuttle is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.270
 for another time and then put a little 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.520
 of hot water 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.810
 let's make the cinnamon expire and there 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.509
 we put our table when 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.649
 Let's start to get hot 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.649
 the big boucle 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.640
 here you see the water if the belly does not 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.250
 make bubbles then me now 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.530
 puts the salt 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.049
 we'll see if I wanted to make pasta 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.799
 practically and begins to put the 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.870
 table was washed three times 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.650
 remember wash it well because even though 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.819
 I can go clean 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.120
 it is a montage that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.450
 it is practically on the ground so I will 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.450
 I recommend washing it well that's how it is 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.359
 now we bring it to a boil to avoid 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.599
 the table cap I started at 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:54.109
 do a little like that means unless 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:56.870
 I put the covered and I was a comic 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.420
 taught me not to take some 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.659
 of vinegar this could clearly to the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.969
 burgundy they would come out happen 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:11.060
 out of the vinegar and I read it on 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:14.449
 lid so hand as it boils and 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 works and does not go that the intense doghouse of 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:21.409
 cabbage you stand after the lid you have to 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.709
 wash with a small recline in short 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:27.290
 all to clean because it will thicken 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.840
 a lot of the legacy so let's do the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.489
 boil if we have to eat it 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.109
 at the end let's do a cooking 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.719
 just not too soft 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.579
 if we must also keep doing the 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.189
 pasta not just make a little warm profile 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.680
 we freeze when you enter we could do it 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.859
 can do pasta and to make others 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.629
 things of the stars as we want you to 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.560
 we bring to a boil and we make in 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.599
 cruises 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.430
 be careful that the water does not leak out 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.870
 but because there is the cover of course 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.370
 then turn down when you see that 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.579
 begins to boil so that the water 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.620
 fails the table you cross are 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.379
 passed exactly since I put it 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.769
 my cabbage on how it consumes 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.500
 in the water 15 minutes now drained 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.310
 had emitted wounds in with the paste for 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.620
 make him all the moisture, in other words, me 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.810
 I let it cool like that and then we can 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.690
 use it to make a reinforcement learning 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.290
 which we will then do for Christmas 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.550
 a tablet flights there are lots 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.250
 in my first course section 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.400
 we could make omelettes we can 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.290
 do many things with cable with Julian if 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.690
 there is more and we put it in 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.320
 containers and then at the time we use it 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.320
 we do it by using it 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.020
 clearly we can either freeze it 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.540
 we say more conveniently in containers 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.540
 a bit hard if not everything is mushy
