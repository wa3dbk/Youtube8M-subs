this<00:00:07.350> windshield<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:08.069> flat<00:00:08.400> black<00:00:09.200> and<00:00:10.200> we'll

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
this windshield in flat black and we'll

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.810 
this windshield in flat black and we'll
use<00:00:10.440> bare<00:00:10.650> metal<00:00:10.800> foil<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> masking

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
use bare metal foil as the masking

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.539 
use bare metal foil as the masking
material<00:00:12.469> you'll<00:00:13.469> need<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> new<00:00:13.950> sharp<00:00:14.280> razor

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549

material you'll need a new sharp razor
blade<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:16.699> first<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.880> take<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.420> strip<00:00:19.170> of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
blade for this first you take a strip of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.420 
blade for this first you take a strip of
the<00:00:19.380> foil<00:00:19.619> cut<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.100> scissors<00:00:22.189> needs<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> be

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the foil cut with scissors needs to be

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.450 
the foil cut with scissors needs to be
larger<00:00:23.760> than<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> air<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.300> masking<00:00:25.460> these

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
larger than the air your masking these

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.279 
larger than the air your masking these
tweezers<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.090> pull<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> foil<00:00:27.689> away<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289

this case we're just doing the lower

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.460 
this case we're just doing the lower
part<00:01:09.910> of<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.030> windshield<00:01:10.479> first<00:01:10.810> we'll<00:01:11.260> do<00:01:11.350> it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
part of the windshield first we'll do it

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:20.040 
part of the windshield first we'll do it
in<00:01:11.530> four<00:01:11.770> sections<00:01:12.040> just<00:01:18.720> keep<00:01:19.720> going<00:01:19.960> along

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
in four sections just keep going along

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.680 
in four sections just keep going along
the<00:01:20.320> length<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.740> strip<00:01:21.009> until<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.420> foil

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
the length of the strip until the foil

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:39.950 
the length of the strip until the foil
is<00:01:22.840> securely<00:01:23.229> stuck<00:01:23.650> in<00:01:23.800> place

the way that's done you'll take a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.110 
the way that's done you'll take a
toothpick<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.580> you<00:01:44.580> want<00:01:44.730> to<00:01:44.820> run<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
toothpick into the separation line

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.950 
toothpick into the separation line
between<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> trim<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.230> hood<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> bare

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
between the trim and the hood so bare

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.930 
between the trim and the hood so bare
metal<00:01:52.080> foil<00:01:52.410> is<00:01:52.560> very<00:01:52.770> malleable<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:53.850> will

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
metal foil is very malleable and it will

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.730 
metal foil is very malleable and it will
stick<00:01:54.240> down<00:01:54.480> into<00:01:54.930> those<00:01:55.050> nooks<00:01:55.230> and<00:01:55.380> crannies

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
stick down into those nooks and crannies

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:15.940 
stick down into those nooks and crannies
you<00:01:55.800> just<00:01:56.010> need<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.250> press<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> in

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
strip and now you can apply paint with a

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.190 
strip and now you can apply paint with a
paintbrush<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:32.459> around<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.819> area<00:02:33.140> I'm<00:02:34.140> not

worried about paint getting on the hood

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.670 
worried about paint getting on the hood
so<00:02:39.329> here's<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.750> looks<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.170> after<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
so here's what it looks like after you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.500 
so here's what it looks like after you
painted<00:02:42.530> with<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> bare<00:02:43.799> metal<00:02:43.890> foil<00:02:44.280> mask<00:02:44.549> so

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
painted with the bare metal foil mask so

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.699 
painted with the bare metal foil mask so
now<00:02:45.659> of<00:02:45.780> course<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.109> need<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.260> remove<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
now of course you need to remove the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.839 
now of course you need to remove the
mask<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.769> just<00:02:50.069> go<00:02:50.220> section<00:02:50.670> by<00:02:50.730> section<00:02:52.849> just

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
mask so just go section by section just

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.649 
mask so just go section by section just
get<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> hold<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.450> one<00:02:54.629> end<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.180> peel<00:02:57.629> it

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
get a hold of one end and just peel it

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.440 
get a hold of one end and just peel it
back<00:02:57.989> along<00:02:58.470> its<00:02:58.709> length<00:02:59.000> that<00:03:00.000> will<00:03:00.150> help<00:03:00.239> it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
back along its length that will help it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.270 
back along its length that will help it
to<00:03:00.569> lift<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.900> nicely<00:03:01.409> without<00:03:01.500> taking<00:03:02.010> any<00:03:02.159> of

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
now you got a really nice sharp line

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:14.990 
now you got a really nice sharp line
there<00:03:08.579> between<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.810> black<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.230> blue<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> just

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
there between the black and blue so just

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.449

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.860 

it<00:03:23.010> works<00:03:23.220> slowly<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.669> pilla<00:03:24.000> foil<00:03:24.299> back<00:03:24.510> along

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
it works slowly a pilla foil back along

it works slowly a pilla foil back along
its<00:03:25.079> length<00:03:25.290> along<00:03:25.889> itself<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:27.389> doesn't

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
its length along itself so it doesn't

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.670 
its length along itself so it doesn't
take<00:03:27.810> any<00:03:27.989> paint<00:03:28.260> with<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:33.230> look<00:03:34.230> at<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.379> nice
