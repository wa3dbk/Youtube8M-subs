00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 yes hello year old you to use would be newer 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 thc today are only 7692 people online was 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.730
 are where they are right now in today 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 but a very small tutorial video too 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.389
 two things , first of all, is one 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.880
 new patch rausgekommen the player times 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.680
 really cool makes way with the paint 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.730
 commentator has the cover is that white 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.740
 I'm not on sausage because activision 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 bz has finally found a solution like 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.170
 we all fall can be the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 succeeded twice to the very first 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 trick when it reaches you the game act 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 even though her good peter was it sooner 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 on low goes on picture in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 communication and a stone on people 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 Do not vote yet and say the game 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 with how many maximum 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.800
 frame rate he later i 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 set with 90 next game 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.420
 that it should always play with 90 and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 not like under 30 when it's good 30 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.100
 then yes then you have 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.510
 problem because then the game and then 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 you do not have fun with the game 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.469
 and ammann nobody said i can go next 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.239
 apps on that right but i leave it 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.350
 Do not show this ad is the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.729
 below to get 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.979
 He wants to see more like it 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 why do I need it the way I do? 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.030
 this ad was to determine how 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 when it was with me it started with me 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.140
 land the pictures 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.369
 go under it when I start over 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 to pull back and grain 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.950
 that's about cod flight you should just 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.700
 me goal next comes to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.409
 so-called renewal and indeed there are 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.009
 here the so-called max ping 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.509
 Attitudes would be afraid with the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.040
 lowest pinger places do not find any 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.869
 people do not agree at all when 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.470
 always takes place on one idiot with you 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.579
 can play 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.009
 therefore could actually be a nice 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.229
 bottle must wolf what is right if 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.579
 you are in the game you can do the perpetrators 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.020
 do not press on to benefits 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.350
 stupid bars indicated these 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 show meaningful because it does not work 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.070
 but will be displayed now 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.950
 So your ping will pay again 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.930
 I would recommend 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.130
 take a look at this ping plays one 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.759
 round and look at again the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.530
 ping 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.689
 what do you have there for an average 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.510
 what does it look like and then give up here 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.910
 the finger 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.180
 how is it usually between 80 and 90 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.440
 and that would also like to adjust why 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.370
 there are only people left 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.970
 between 80 and plusminus 60 and 100 ps 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.400
 if he is tall now and then 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 sat la compensatory because if he 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.570
 is still there, we have not officially 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.010
 But definitely it is removed 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.540
 then you have this again 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.760
 then jerking game become people 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.260
 put everything and then you have 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.570
 actually what you have before the patch 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.130
 had thus would have about the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.720
 average will always be calculated like that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.470
 Circle people play with you with the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.020
 actually so about 20 to 20 24 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.970
 have as their mapping have the people 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.980
 Thus, 200 pin play then they are 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.050
 actually rare and they have that 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.220
 until now where I round it over 30 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.490
 are last played not like that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.959
 but it can be serious 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.180
 It is not my conclusion in any case 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.300
 patch the power awesome i have again 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.490
 time a kadermann corner the clock so 10 16 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.980
 usually become suddenly laughed 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.290
 has because I can see the videos one 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.880
 I'm always fine 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.820
 Show if you want to see me with you 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.160
 my fire runs both is with two 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.070
 chapter I have reached the option it 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.690
 then press yes what wears and 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.030
 actually do not have strict because otherwise 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.370
 problems can come just can better 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.430
 paint all the fucking but 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.350
 really a lot through this patch 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.350
 has changed 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.940
 ping is much smoother than the game 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.280
 really makes fun for all those 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.900
 no team of black for a long time now 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 Swan played because they are just these 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.130
 whole treat and compensation shit 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.050
 she was annoyed, they should really be back 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.550
 it's really cool 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.950
 I threw players in the corner 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.570
 because of all this la compensation 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.370
 I shot more arrived circuit 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.700
 not at I was then doing that is not 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.600
 more so 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.060
 I have my kg again from 26 to 9 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.519
 I am happy I am up 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.860
 played gold once again that's how it works 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.430
 yes that was just the tool of the bishop 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.430
 it can help
