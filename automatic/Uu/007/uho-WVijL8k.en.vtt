00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
highlighter brush which I think of as

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.560 
highlighter brush which I think of as
more<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> stippling<00:01:38.400> brush<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.060> what

more of a stippling brush that I do what

this is a dual fibre brush in in a real

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
this is a dual fibre brush in in a real

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
there are two different kinds of fibers

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
there are two different kinds of fibers
in<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.310> apply<00:01:53.430> out

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
in here and I do like this to apply out

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.359 
in here and I do like this to apply out
highlights<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:55.470> only<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:55.920> cheeks<00:01:56.159> but

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
highlights not only on my cheeks but

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.100 
highlights not only on my cheeks but
also<00:01:56.490> elsewhere<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> rest<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.659> face<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
also elsewhere on the rest of my face I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.630 
also elsewhere on the rest of my face I
also<00:01:58.439> find<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> stippling

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
also find that this kind of stippling

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
also find that this kind of stippling
brush<00:01:59.759> is<00:02:00.030> great<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.450> apply<00:02:00.750> gel<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.740> liquid

but at the same time the size is such

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.120 
but at the same time the size is such
that<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.600> can<00:02:20.870> use<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:21.350> areas<00:02:21.710> like<00:02:21.740> your

angled contour brush this is not the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.850 
first time I've used a brush with this
shape<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:29.990> this<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.230> definitely<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
shape but this is definitely the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.130 
shape but this is definitely the
smallest<00:02:31.250> brush<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:32.630> shape<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.020> I've

smallest brush of this shape that I've

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.410 
smallest brush of this shape that I've
used<00:02:33.380> what<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.620> typically<00:02:34.040> work<00:02:34.670> with<00:02:34.910> when<00:02:35.180> it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
used what I typically work with when it

comes to angled contour brush is is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.490 
comes to angled contour brush is is
something<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:37.940> size<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.990> was<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> little

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
something this size this was a little

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.900 
something this size this was a little
bit<00:02:39.620> different<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.070> work<00:02:40.220> with<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.640> the

bit different to work with and the

blend<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.310> make<00:03:07.460> sure<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.790> you're<00:03:07.910> using<00:03:07.940> a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
blend and make sure that you're using a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.390 
blend and make sure that you're using a
very<00:03:08.360> light<00:03:08.660> hand<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.200> you're<00:03:09.560> using<00:03:09.710> a<00:03:09.980> deeper

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
very light hand if you're using a deeper

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.280 
very light hand if you're using a deeper
contour<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.360> last<00:03:11.570> brush<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
contour and the last brush is the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.130 
contour and the last brush is the
rounded<00:03:12.770> blush<00:03:13.130> brush<00:03:13.520> which<00:03:14.110> despite<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
rounded blush brush which despite the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.020 
rounded blush brush which despite the
name<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.560> actually<00:03:15.740> like<00:03:16.040> using<00:03:16.250> more<00:03:16.760> for

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
name I actually like using more for

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.480 
name I actually like using more for
contour<00:03:17.480> because<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:18.020> fits<00:03:18.320> directly<00:03:18.770> into

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
contour because it fits directly into

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.010 
contour because it fits directly into
the<00:03:19.580> hollows<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.090> my<00:03:20.120> cheeks<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.690> find<00:03:20.900> it's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
the hollows of my cheeks I find it's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.900 
the hollows of my cheeks I find it's
really<00:03:21.080> easy<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.740> work<00:03:21.890> in<00:03:22.070> nice<00:03:22.280> circular

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
really easy to work in nice circular

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.820 
really easy to work in nice circular
motions<00:03:23.330> whereas<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.900> kind<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.230> shape<00:03:24.470> isn't

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
motions whereas this kind of shape isn't

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.440 
motions whereas this kind of shape isn't
really<00:03:25.010> conducive<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.790> kind<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.209> motion

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
really conducive to that kind of motion

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.330 
really conducive to that kind of motion
so<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:27.230> really<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.500> take<00:03:27.739> your<00:03:27.890> pick<00:03:28.040> kind<00:03:28.280> of

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
so it's really a take your pick kind of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.900 
so it's really a take your pick kind of
thing<00:03:28.550> also<00:03:29.450> with<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.810> blush<00:03:30.350> brush<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:31.040> find

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
thing also with the blush brush I find

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.400 
thing also with the blush brush I find
that<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.150> bristles<00:03:32.600> again<00:03:33.020> they<00:03:33.170> have<00:03:33.290> that

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
that the bristles again they have that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.560 
that the bristles again they have that
kind<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.709> coarse<00:03:34.010> consistency<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.540> a

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
kind of coarse consistency and this is a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.440 
kind of coarse consistency and this is a
much<00:03:35.780> more<00:03:36.080> smaller<00:03:36.860> more<00:03:37.100> dense<00:03:37.640> brush<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
much more smaller more dense brush that

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.720 
much more smaller more dense brush that
I<00:03:38.480> personally<00:03:39.170> don't<00:03:39.530> like<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.980> apply<00:03:40.250> brush<00:03:40.550> I

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
I personally don't like to apply brush I

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.030 
I personally don't like to apply brush I
like<00:03:40.760> something<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.510> lot<00:03:41.930> fluffier<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.860> gives

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
like something a lot fluffier that gives

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.130 
like something a lot fluffier that gives
me<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.190> little<00:03:43.340> bit<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.850> wiggle<00:03:44.690> room<00:03:44.720> when<00:03:45.020> it

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
me a little bit of wiggle room when it

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.930 
me a little bit of wiggle room when it
comes<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.590> applying<00:03:45.860> blush<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.790> can

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
comes to applying blush that I can

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.570 
comes to applying blush that I can
really<00:03:47.090> work<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.510> build<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:48.530> for<00:03:49.040> me<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.370> kind

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
really work to build this for me is kind

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.070 
really work to build this for me is kind
of<00:03:49.700> all<00:03:49.880> or<00:03:49.910> nothing<00:03:50.390> because<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.780> will<00:03:50.900> pick

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
of all or nothing because it will pick

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.449 
of all or nothing because it will pick
up<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.290> lot<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.470> product<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.100> lay<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> down

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
up a lot of product and lay it down

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.580 
up a lot of product and lay it down
really<00:03:52.850> effectively<00:03:53.510> there<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:53.989> no<00:03:54.290> room<00:03:54.560> to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
really effectively there is no room to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.260 
really effectively there is no room to
work<00:03:54.739> like<00:03:55.130> something<00:03:55.489> like<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.880> gives<00:03:56.150> you

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
work like something like this gives you

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.930 
work like something like this gives you
so<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.320> prefer<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.430> use<00:03:58.580> it<00:03:58.730> as<00:03:58.850> a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
so for that I prefer to use it as a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.720 
so for that I prefer to use it as a
contour<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.810> even<00:04:00.170> up<00:04:00.500> into<00:04:00.770> areas<00:04:01.340> like<00:04:01.370> this

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
contour and even up into areas like this

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.910 
contour and even up into areas like this
as<00:04:01.910> well<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:02.330> sometimes<00:04:02.600> down<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.560> sides<00:04:03.770> of

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
as well as sometimes down the sides of

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.530 
as well as sometimes down the sides of
my<00:04:04.010> nose<00:04:04.040> because<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.520> is<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:04.910> small<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.270> can

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
my nose because it is so small you can

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.080 
my nose because it is so small you can
do<00:04:05.810> sort<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.260> more<00:04:06.320> precise<00:04:06.890> work<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:07.850> now<00:04:07.970> that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
do sort of more precise work so now that

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.550 
do sort of more precise work so now that
