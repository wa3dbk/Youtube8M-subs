00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.980
 good afternoon with you heading news and 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.330
 new items here ibis company and today we 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.090
 We are considering a new weapon 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.460
 carbine on 15 from the company Norsky groan 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.080
 Armas this novelty we for sure 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.030
 add some oil to the fire 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.330
 perennial discussions about which is better 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.910
 Kalashnikov or m4 n16 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.860
 but this discussion will take a little 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.310
 unexpected turn because given 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.580
 carbine works in caliber 762 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.070
 at 39 i.e. in the eternal hummingbird for 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.460
 Kalashnikov sample '47 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.440
 carabiners sks and so on 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.450
 unusual enough for a weapon 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.780
 American sample and the more interesting 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.520
 find out in detail about how she is with 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.210
 it works and that you have it 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.640
 are obtained 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.350
 and so the carbine on 15 has a pretty 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.760
 typical civilian configuration 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.960
 carbines designs ar-15 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.170
 telescopic plastic butt our 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.479
 with the positions of the barrel length of 14 and a half 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 inches made of chrome molybdenum and 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.639
 vanadium in gun steel in it 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.259
 made polygonal rifling he also 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.479
 carbonite 3 rowan which allows 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.770
 count on a resource of about 10,000 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.149
 shots on the trunk of the flame arrestor 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.409
 it is also possible to install other muzzle 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.810
 nozzles on five-eighths of the hut standards 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.679
 24 inches like all weapon types 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.899
 r15 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.749
 the barrel of this carbine 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.689
 consists of two parts top and 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:45.219
 lower receivers which are made of 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.899
 aluminum 6061 t6 by milling in 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.549
 principle in all its basic 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.929
 characteristics of this carbine or what 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.659
 no different from typical 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.950
 r15-type carbines 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.619
 the exception is a branded rail forend 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.719
 companies which is not a console 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.610
 the barrel is freely hung 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.350
 but on the fore-end from four sides 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.420
 arranged picatinny rail for 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.700
 installation of additional various 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.530
 accessories 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.069
 another feature of this weapon 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.700
 is the question of his food since 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.959
 The cartridge of caliber 76 2 on 39 demands 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.870
 special stores 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.420
 then accordingly associated with it 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.959
 Some nuances because shops from 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.750
 ak m 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.180
 by itself for this weapon is not 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.459
 fit therefore bundled we 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.019
 supply 5th charging shop and could 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.310
 pool also exists such an option 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.220
 which is very similar to standard 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.349
 shops for ar-15 rifles however here 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.410
 slightly changed configuration 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.660
 sponge store and feeder due to what 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.400
 this store allows you to work reliably 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.319
 with ammunition type 762 39 and finally 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.940
 the most interesting question is how does it work 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.829
 it is a weapon that it can and which 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.019
 the results show we spent 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.019
 test shooting this carbine cutter and 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.010
 We got these results from 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.560
 using a collimator sight this 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.819
 three sighting shots is about 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.430
 30 shots valid at 50 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.889
 meters using a collimator in this 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.280
 option this carbine may well 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.010
 fulfill the role of weapons for short 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.630
 distances so-called secu by well and in 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.170
 principle standard assault roles 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.590
 rifles 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.420
 but by replacing some parts 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.340
 installation of additional accessories 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.130
 This carbine can be turned into more 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.480
 exact weapon 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.889
 rifle exactly fire support now 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.889
 I will show how this can be done 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.820
 here in this form with stopped 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.120
 optical sight not castrated 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.389
 seamar multiplicity of from 1 to 10 x itself 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.250
 moderated in the morning Celsius and bipod 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.050
 harris on the quick-release adapter for 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.960
 pikatini slats given weapon 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.150
 becoming quite accurate enough 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.180
 version of the carbine for shooting on 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.389
 short and medium distances 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.120
 accuracy we could get from it on 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.740
 100 meters distance 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.880
 gross cartridge manufactured by the company 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.860
 place 762 by 39 try to achieve 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.680
 similar accuracy within two 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.940
 angular minutes from the base weapon 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.310
 Kalashnikov rifles 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.490
 well, it may be at least very 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.080
 hamper with so main 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.150
 distinctive features of this weapon 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.430
 this work with powerful ammunition 72 to 39 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.789
 it's his high accuracy is good 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.280
 accuracy and we hope that such 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.000
 carabiner type r15 production 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.990
 com canadian company sea moan arm 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.060
 sure to find their fans 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.060
 among Ukrainian shooters
