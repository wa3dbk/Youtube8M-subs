00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
dug up another camera that we could use

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.069 
dug up another camera that we could use
and<00:00:57.780> yeah<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.730> crazy<00:01:00.300> efficient

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and yeah so this is like crazy efficient

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.320 
and yeah so this is like crazy efficient
hint<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.489> camera<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> yeah<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.210> were

hint it's this camera so yeah we were
this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.979> pretty<00:01:08.100> well<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:09.450> can

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this is it's going pretty well you can

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.230 
this is it's going pretty well you can
see<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.140> may<00:01:11.010> possibly<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.610> using<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> green

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
see we may possibly be using the green

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.560 
see we may possibly be using the green
screen<00:01:12.619> for<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.830> we're<00:01:13.950> doing<00:01:14.420> not<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
screen for what we're doing not to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.039 
screen for what we're doing not to
reveal<00:01:15.810> too<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:17.009> yeah<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.450> think

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
