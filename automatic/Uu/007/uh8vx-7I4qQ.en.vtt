00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.720 
so it's expressing completion or in
sequencing<00:02:16.000> different<00:02:16.660> trends<00:02:17.140> okay<00:02:17.610> good

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
sequencing different trends okay good

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.720 
sequencing different trends okay good
and<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:19.810> relative<00:02:20.349> clauses<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:21.130> are<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:21.520> to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
and for relative clauses we are going to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.790 
and for relative clauses we are going to
look<00:02:21.970> at<00:02:22.120> first<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.690> all<00:02:22.750> structure<00:02:23.410> general

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
look at first of all structure general

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.350 
look at first of all structure general
structure

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
structure

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.690 
structure
taking<00:02:24.960> into<00:02:25.110> consideration<00:02:25.700> defining

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
taking into consideration defining

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.880 
taking into consideration defining
relative<00:02:26.820> clauses<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.630> non<00:02:28.320> defining

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
relative clauses and non defining

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.820 
relative clauses and non defining
relative<00:02:29.010> clauses<00:02:30.110> then<00:02:31.110> we're<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.680> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
relative clauses then we're going to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.150 
relative clauses then we're going to
look<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.420> how<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> use<00:02:33.660> relative<00:02:34.620> clauses<00:02:34.830> with

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
look at how to use relative clauses with

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.360 
look at how to use relative clauses with
prepositions<00:02:35.690> okay<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:37.410> we<00:02:38.190> use

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
prepositions okay because we use

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.440 
prepositions okay because we use
relative<00:02:39.030> clauses<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.540> with<00:02:40.380> prepositions<00:02:40.740> in

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
relative clauses in with prepositions in

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.360 
relative clauses in with prepositions in
general<00:02:42.450> English<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.560> number<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.010> different

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
general English in a number of different

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.400 
general English in a number of different
ways<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:44.910> for<00:02:45.180> IELTS<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.080> use<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
ways but for IELTS we want to use the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.830 
ways but for IELTS we want to use the
more<00:02:46.560> formal<00:02:47.130> approach<00:02:47.360> okay<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.630> we're<00:02:48.750> going

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
more formal approach okay so we're going

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.990 
more formal approach okay so we're going
to<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> look<00:02:50.610> at<00:02:50.730> how<00:02:50.940> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to do that we're going to look at how to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.440 
to do that we're going to look at how to
substitute<00:02:51.510> relative<00:02:52.350> clauses<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.920> other

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
substitute relative clauses with other

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.330 
substitute relative clauses with other
structures<00:02:54.450> namely<00:02:55.290> substituting<00:02:56.220> with

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
structures namely substituting with

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.540 
structures namely substituting with
particular<00:02:57.000> present<00:02:57.620> preposition<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
particular present preposition with the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.060 
particular present preposition with the
word<00:02:59.700> with<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.209> then<00:03:00.930> looking<00:03:01.350> at<00:03:01.530> again

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
word with and then looking at again

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.600 
word with and then looking at again
present<00:03:02.850> participles<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.780> past<00:03:04.709> participles

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
present participles and past participles

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.979 
present participles and past participles
okay<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:07.400> most<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.700> will<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:09.420> studied

okay now most of you will have studied

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.590 
okay now most of you will have studied
relative<00:03:10.620> clauses<00:03:10.830> before<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:12.239> might<00:03:12.420> not

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
relative clauses before you might not

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.180 
relative clauses before you might not
have<00:03:12.690> studied<00:03:13.110> them<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.590> formal<00:03:13.980> situation

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
have studied them in a formal situation

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.060 
have studied them in a formal situation
like<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.820> IELTS<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.959> if<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.830> studied

these before and know quite a lot about

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.470 
these before and know quite a lot about
them<00:03:18.989> then<00:03:19.440> that's<00:03:19.890> good<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.180> going<00:03:21.330> to

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.270 
not taught until higher levels the
structure<00:03:29.430> might<00:03:29.580> look<00:03:29.640> simple<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.980> can

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
structure might look simple but it can

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.009 
structure might look simple but it can
be<00:03:32.459> quite<00:03:32.700> complicated<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:34.820> use<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.450> come

so that's why we've got to kind of

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.449
