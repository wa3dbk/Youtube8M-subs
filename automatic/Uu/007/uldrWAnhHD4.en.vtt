00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.480

 year all this is a trend more and more 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 more it spreads more and more 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 pronounced becomes ie very 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.070
 I don't know a lot of people visiting 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.990
 Caucasus there Armenians Azerbaijanis who are there 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 I would say it's minutes to the Caucasus 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.440
 there are no different kinds of them Chechens I do not know 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 who is there attack station with yellow numbers 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.030
 as basically that is, look 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 human what if the car is expensive well 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.980
 darling have over 1,000,000 rubles i 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 I think too expensive car here if he 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 yellow number but yellow number what is it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
 is where the region is from yellowish it to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 stands out 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.039
 This then when you if not in this city 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.629
 as it were spelled out in the city Ostap 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 left the car registration in this city 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.260
 I came here accordingly if I'm in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.770
 Moscow I live but now I ride in Moscow 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.350
 I see 77 umbrellas region number and series 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.439
 they have a different series before or 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.799
 I need a pequod I have a number before the war and 6 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.680
 he 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.220
 and when I lived tech rooms then I'll be there 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 if you translate into my world it will be in about 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 006 n if I'm not mistaken everything is correct 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 sort of said yes and there will be a region 7 7 if 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.340
 man let's say from Dagestan came to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.409
 Moscow let's say I do not know where he bought it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.210
 the car is no longer important but behind the arrows 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 machines put on record Moscow and then 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 he will be given such a yellow number and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.680
 two letters ahead in the thread numbers 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.020
 of himself 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.000
 here and of course it upsets me tom 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 plan that there is no they of course simulation 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 nobody against not nothing against anyone 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.030
 not having but the fact that the Russian people are lazy 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.050
 it is a fact more and more 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.420
 getting repeat from these 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.190
 from visitors to which are well on expensive 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.660
 cars drive obviously that they do not have wealth 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.120
 little let's say that so they don't 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.590
 poor people if they have money for 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.450
 car as it grows more than 1,000,000 rubles 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.800
 it means a person is not poor from 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.020
 ironic somehow earn if 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.880
 machine you put here is Moscow 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.810
 accordingly, most likely he does not have 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.300
 affairs here moscow 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.620
 unscrew up some of course this 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.450
 another topic where such come from 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.670
 money rather all some kind of small business 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.800
 average large no matter here but that 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.570
 plan that i will repeat that russians 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.760
 people are lazy squad literally today in 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.620
 those discussed with my friend whom 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.990
 sometimes you see in the frame that you write everything 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.270
 About thin not drunk still he just loves 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.830
 drink let's say well yes of course yes it's two 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.040
 a separate topic is his addiction 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.470
 but one thing nonetheless here he says that 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.300
 like the Russian people so bring up with 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.460
 birth there they vaccinate what they need 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.980
 do nothing there on hope for russian 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.230
 maybe it began to spend no about mine 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.320

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.410
 that all these rhythms are all Russian 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.540
 people again well so bring up what they 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.800
 type do not want to do anything lazy like 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.250
 would assume that nothing should be done 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.100
 here I like I do not even know how 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.840
 maybe he is part of the rights but still I 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.520
 I don't know, but how can you not want 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.290
 have the same expensive car up on 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.329
 which guests from the Caucasus and the like 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.120
 people go down as may not want 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.060
 I want to not everyone wants to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.250
 do something lazy about it 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.769
 if you really really want that under 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.599
 strain to come up with some kind of one 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.939
 same business I don't know because 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.560
 Again, of course on the usual salary 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.959
 you can not buy yourself but there is only a loan 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.790
 on this perversion if you get 30 50 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.129
 thousand to borrow a car for a million 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.599
 excess rubles is somehow wrong as 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.939
