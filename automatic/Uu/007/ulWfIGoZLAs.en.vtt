00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello the least secure i have a coast of europe last week 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:12.679
 % thanks to the time of the school I discovered an internet killing 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.429
 in a driving school we offer information registrations at the center on 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.369
 dear but the boss of the med club by the online department 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.400
 it was pretty much simplifying as a training 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.630
 but knowing that are being done I discovered this site which 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.419
 is called last club 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.010
 it's pretty well done 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.270
 a source cited among the schools liÃ¨vremont very code courses 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.320
 complete that completely replaces 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.570
 the two usual codes 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.900
 which allows the world very happy of my turn is in a mood for him well 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.970
 prepared for men in the final all and presented by themes 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.850
 we have a dispute 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.059
 for the support also as physical state the obligatory documents 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 signaling lights in braking 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.460
 intersection and priorities% to a traffic of my speed 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.210
 the crossings an overtaking 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.290
 so a club site 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.460
 when we click on interception 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.870
 the priorities 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.880
 everything is hulled and detailed 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.550
 we also offer demonstrations in three dimensions - 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.750
 which are very realistic and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.930
 quite well done 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
 for example control a decision 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.000
 hanging on the outer shell 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630
 jean-pierre pernaut at the time 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 then right 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 me as a graphic designer we are in hell 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.280
 the first will show list and voila it adds a rather playful side 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.070
 and that also makes you want to take shots 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 but a little safer 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 who with photos% of those killed looks pretty boring 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.150
 but what is really good with them is like schools 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.490
 it's an hour after doing all the tests 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.490
 to return to the statistics of our tests 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.590
 and we see a man right away 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 what are our strengths and weaknesses 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.329
 for example on the risks 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.340
 Jules is a strong point for me I'm 100% successful 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.809
 on the other hand on written questions or questions of priority or 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.529
 three years - overflow 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.559
 hello and that their crossing overtaking cat 16% so 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.689
 I have my weak points 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.319
 I can also return to your or the different series I could 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.789
 test 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:32.109
 and when I click I see immediately a response gives an answer 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.049
 and then it's a little bit to go back to the sources of the mistakes I was able to make 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.029
 and here we explain in detail m but why I was wrong but I 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.689
 immediately understand better why I made a mistake behind the horns 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.430
 above has subsequently recalled% rework all is not clog the 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.269
 weaknesses 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.579
 thanks to this site I was able to make a coup 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.379
 in the past the hardest was done
