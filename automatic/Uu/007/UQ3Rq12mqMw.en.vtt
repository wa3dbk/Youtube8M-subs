engrossed in the story I will admit that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
engrossed in the story I will admit that
I<00:01:18.149> did<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> main<00:01:18.960> character<00:01:19.170> hector<00:01:19.800> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
I did like the main character hector and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
I did like the main character hector and
the<00:01:20.190> rivalry<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:21.030> had<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.390> isaac<00:01:21.840> as

the rivalry that he had with isaac as
well<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> interactions<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.250> he

much<00:01:26.190> here<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.610> invested<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:28.460> as<00:01:29.460> far<00:01:29.850> as

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
much here to get invested in as far as

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.120 
much here to get invested in as far as
six<00:01:30.479> generation<00:01:31.110> titles<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
six generation titles go this is a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
six generation titles go this is a
decent<00:01:32.670> looking<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.179> clearly<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.750> didn't

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
decent looking one clearly it didn't

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.710 
decent looking one clearly it didn't
have<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.319> budget<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:35.220> triple-a<00:01:35.970> title<00:01:36.509> but

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have the budget of a triple-a title but

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
have the budget of a triple-a title but
it's<00:01:36.840> definitely<00:01:37.050> not<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> low-budget<00:01:38.190> game

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it's definitely not a low-budget game

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.199 
it's definitely not a low-budget game
either

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
either

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.669 
either
i<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.630> game's<00:01:39.840> biggest<00:01:40.200> issue

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
i think the game's biggest issue

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.040 
i think the game's biggest issue
visually<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.550> simply<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.509> repeating

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
visually is simply the repeating

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.320 
visually is simply the repeating
environments<00:01:43.890> even<00:01:44.190> though<00:01:44.550> you<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.300> to

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
environments even though you do go to

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.540 
environments even though you do go to
different<00:01:45.660> areas<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.679> visually

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
different areas that are visually

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.830 
different areas that are visually
different<00:01:47.850> from<00:01:48.209> each<00:01:48.330> other<00:01:48.539> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
different from each other the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.779 
different from each other the
environments<00:01:49.440> within<00:01:49.800> each<00:01:50.039> area<00:01:50.580> are

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
environments within each area are

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.199 
environments within each area are
visually<00:01:51.630> tedious<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:52.800> actually<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.789> as<00:01:53.940> far<00:01:54.090> as

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
visually tedious i actually go as far as

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.090 
visually tedious i actually go as far as
to<00:01:54.300> say<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.050> game's<00:01:55.350> greatest

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to say that this is the game's greatest

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.309 
to say that this is the game's greatest
weakness<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> compare<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.080> the

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
weakness when you compare to the

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.089 
weakness when you compare to the
beautiful<00:01:59.420> handcrafted<00:02:00.420> castles<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:01.590> city
