I'm scared I don't know what how to
react<00:00:47.059> my<00:00:48.059> eyes<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.450> already<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.930> tearing

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
react my eyes are already like tearing

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.850 
react my eyes are already like tearing
up<00:00:49.410> from<00:00:49.739> anxiety<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:54.719> looks<00:00:54.899> pretty<00:00:55.140> swaggin

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
up from anxiety it looks pretty swaggin

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430 
up from anxiety it looks pretty swaggin
though<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.570> even<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> word

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
though it's not that that even is a word

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.580 
though it's not that that even is a word
but<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.430> clearly<00:00:59.750> put<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.930> speed<00:01:01.260> limit

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
but they clearly put that speed limit

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
but they clearly put that speed limit
sign<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.820> number<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> certain<00:01:03.750> reason

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
sign at that number for a certain reason

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.070 
sign at that number for a certain reason
I<00:01:04.909> think<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.810> song

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I think this is actually a good song

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.250 
I think this is actually a good song
though<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> remember<00:01:12.049> it's<00:01:13.049> got

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
though from what I remember it's got

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.429 
though from what I remember it's got
that<00:01:13.409> swoop<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.040> his<00:01:14.159> hair<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.080> they're<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that swoop in his hair and they're just

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
that swoop in his hair and they're just
on<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> road<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.250> middle<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> nowhere<00:01:20.869> it's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
on a road in the middle of nowhere it's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
on a road in the middle of nowhere it's
so<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.140> different<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.100> only<00:01:23.220> knew

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so like different because I only knew

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
so like different because I only knew
Gary<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.299> Running<00:01:24.630> Man<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.530> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Gary from Running Man right so it's like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.780 
Gary from Running Man right so it's like
I'm<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.040> even<00:01:26.159> used<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.990> rapping<00:01:28.549> I'm<00:01:29.549> sure

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I'm not even used to it rapping I'm sure

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
I'm not even used to it rapping I'm sure
she<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> itchy<00:01:30.600> guys<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
she was just itchy guys like I think I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.960 
she was just itchy guys like I think I
think<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.670> clearly<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> case<00:01:33.570> she<00:01:33.840> just

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
think that's clearly the case she just

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
think that's clearly the case she just
okay<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.299> she's<00:01:36.930> probably<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.500> than<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.799> chi

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
okay well she's probably more than a chi

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.319 
okay well she's probably more than a chi
now<00:01:40.490> though<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:41.729> were<00:01:41.850> those<00:01:41.880> shoes

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
now though there were those shoes

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.800 
now though there were those shoes
floating<00:01:42.960> around<00:01:43.079> him

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
floating around him

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.420 
floating around him
I<00:01:44.840> don't<00:01:45.500> think<00:01:45.560> he<00:01:45.799> was<00:01:45.890> thinking<00:01:46.340> about

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
I don't think he was thinking about

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.130 
I don't think he was thinking about
shooting<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.700> know<00:01:52.760> everything<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.869> know

Western<00:03:07.420> hip-hop<00:03:07.870> world<00:03:08.140> that's<00:03:08.920> typical<00:03:09.610> of

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
Western hip-hop world that's typical of

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.360 
Western hip-hop world that's typical of
these<00:03:10.780> things<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.530> doesn't<00:03:11.920> mean<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.160> right

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
these things it doesn't mean it's right

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.970 
these things it doesn't mean it's right
but<00:03:12.790> I'm<00:03:12.910> just<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.390> saying<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:16.530> could<00:03:17.530> style

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
but I'm just just saying I could style

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.820 
but I'm just just saying I could style
down<00:03:20.490> so<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:22.000> know<00:03:22.260> while<00:03:23.260> we're<00:03:23.440> doing<00:03:23.680> this

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
down so you know while we're doing this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.500 
down so you know while we're doing this
let's<00:03:24.220> try<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.490> think<00:03:24.730> about<00:03:25.030> what<00:03:25.240> they<00:03:25.450> were

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
let's try to think about what they were

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.880 
let's try to think about what they were
constructing<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.680> think<00:03:27.640> she<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.090> trying<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
constructing I think she is trying to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.940 
constructing I think she is trying to
make<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> coffee<00:03:30.340> table<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:32.230> her<00:03:32.380> family<00:03:32.830> at

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
make a coffee table for her family at

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.950 
make a coffee table for her family at
home<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.760> I'm<00:03:36.910> not<00:03:37.090> trying<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.570> make<00:03:37.750> fun

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
home so I'm not trying to like make fun

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.420 
home so I'm not trying to like make fun
of<00:03:38.020> this<00:03:38.200> I'm<00:03:38.410> just<00:03:38.560> trying<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:38.980> evade<00:03:39.400> any

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
of this I'm just trying to evade any

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.840 
of this I'm just trying to evade any
awkward<00:03:40.060> silences<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.780> me<00:03:41.170> just<00:03:41.470> staring<00:03:41.920> at

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
awkward silences of me just staring at

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:51.750 
awkward silences of me just staring at
things<00:03:49.350> some<00:03:50.350> things<00:03:50.380> are<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.070> peeking<00:03:51.610> out
