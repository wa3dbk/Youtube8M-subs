00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
a question I get so commonly that I'm

a question I get so commonly that I'm
not<00:00:02.310> even<00:00:02.340> sure<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.909> whom<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.179> should<00:00:03.210> attribute

to do a shoryuken focus - now these two

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.719 
to do a shoryuken focus - now these two
should<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.650> close<00:01:13.920> together<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.610> the

a cornered opponent or certain ultras
you'll<00:01:53.580> want<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.909> able<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.119> f-80c<00:01:54.659> back<00:01:54.869> -

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you'll want to be able to f-80c back -

immediate<00:02:20.280> ultra<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.880> looks<00:02:21.120> like<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:23.750> it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
immediate ultra it looks like this it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.000 
immediate ultra it looks like this it
might<00:02:24.900> feel<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.290> you're<00:02:25.470> doing<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.860> bit

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
might feel like you're doing it a bit

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.610 
might feel like you're doing it a bit
slow<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> f-80c<00:02:27.660> combo<00:02:28.049> your<00:02:28.410> dash

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
slow but in the f-80c combo your dash

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.020 
slow but in the f-80c combo your dash
will<00:02:28.799> come<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.040> later<00:02:29.280> than<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.610> input<00:02:29.760> it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
will come out later than you input it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
will come out later than you input it
and<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.269> ultra<00:02:30.510> will<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.720> sooner<00:02:30.930> after<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
and the ultra will be sooner after the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.350 
and the ultra will be sooner after the
dash<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.940> treat<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.209> dash

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
dash because of that just treat the dash

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
dash because of that just treat the dash
like<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.720> part<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.989> one<00:02:34.170> long<00:02:34.319> Ultra<00:02:34.680> motion

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
like it's part of one long Ultra motion

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.860 
like it's part of one long Ultra motion
and<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> should<00:02:35.459> get<00:02:35.580> pretty<00:02:35.819> good<00:02:35.880> at<00:02:36.000> this

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.240 

the<00:02:39.870> reason<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.290> set<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> break<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.920> down<00:02:40.950> into

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the reason I set to break it down into

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.009 
the reason I set to break it down into
these<00:02:41.430> three<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.299> should<00:02:42.480> hopefully<00:02:42.660> know

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
these three is you should hopefully know

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.270 
these three is you should hopefully know
when<00:02:43.200> attempting<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> whole<00:02:43.830> thing<00:02:44.069> where

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
when attempting the whole thing where

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.800 
when attempting the whole thing where
your<00:02:44.430> areas<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.120> which<00:02:45.269> part<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.630> should

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
your areas are and which part you should

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
your areas are and which part you should
practice<00:02:46.280> if<00:02:47.280> you're<00:02:47.459> getting<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.940> you're

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
practice if you're getting this you're

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.360 
practice if you're getting this you're
either<00:02:48.570> doing<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> F<00:02:49.140> ADC<00:02:49.590> too<00:02:49.769> late<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.220> not

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
either doing the F ADC too late or not

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.560 
either doing the F ADC too late or not
getting<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> medium<00:02:51.030> buttons<00:02:51.299> at<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.480> same

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
getting the medium buttons at the same

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.470 
getting the medium buttons at the same
time<00:02:54.950> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.640> you're<00:02:57.150> not<00:02:57.299> holding

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
time if you see this you're not holding

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
time if you see this you're not holding
the<00:02:57.690> focus<00:02:57.989> attack<00:02:58.230> long<00:02:58.470> enough<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:02.060> if<00:03:03.060> this

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the focus attack long enough and if this

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.910 
the focus attack long enough and if this
happens<00:03:03.630> you're<00:03:03.930> holding<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> focus<00:03:04.620> attack

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
happens you're holding the focus attack

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.789 
happens you're holding the focus attack
too<00:03:05.130> long<00:03:08.930> doing<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.140> complete<00:03:10.500> or<00:03:10.650> partial

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
too long doing a complete or partial

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.740 
too long doing a complete or partial
ultra<00:03:11.250> motion<00:03:11.609> then<00:03:11.819> releasing<00:03:12.239> focus<00:03:12.569> will

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
ultra motion then releasing focus will

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.090 
ultra motion then releasing focus will
give<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.019> negative<00:03:13.200> edge<00:03:13.500> special<00:03:13.920> move

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
give you a negative edge special move

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.309 
give you a negative edge special move
for<00:03:14.310> most<00:03:14.489> characters<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.630> release<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.019> focus

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
for most characters so release the focus

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.170 
for most characters so release the focus
before<00:03:16.500> doing<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.100> motion<00:03:17.459> ideally<00:03:17.940> during

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
before doing the motion ideally during

before doing the motion ideally during
the<00:03:18.299> dash<00:03:18.450> animation<00:03:19.400> beyond<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.880> all

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the dash animation beyond that it's all

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.430 
the dash animation beyond that it's all
just<00:03:21.239> about<00:03:21.359> tightening<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.959> up<00:03:22.019> until<00:03:22.290> you're

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
just about tightening it up until you're

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.020 
just about tightening it up until you're
doing<00:03:22.680> everything<00:03:22.950> fast<00:03:23.310> enough<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.910> all
