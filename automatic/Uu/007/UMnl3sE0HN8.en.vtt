00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.840
 another of the issues that concern us the most 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.640
 is the household debt and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 definitively all of us homes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.289
 let's see what the evolution has been and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.079
 we are at the end of 2012 for 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 understand how the thing is in some 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.470
 opportunity and we have commented that the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.850
 family debt had skyrocketed 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.589
 in 2003 there was a total debt of 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.620
 451 billion euros and that of 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:40.800
 the affordability of credit 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.780
 caused us all to get into debt 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.580
 in the movie and on both sides is 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.369
 say those who left the money that we 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.869
 they were swelling and we were bubbling and 

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:50.089
 also us to take it therefore 

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:54.510
 we also have some responsibility 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.489
 we reached a point in 2008 of 913 thousand 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.049
 million euros round numbers of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.269
 debt therefore means that in that 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.449
 space that goes from the year 2003 until 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.400
 In 2008, the debt of families 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.290
 we had doubled from there the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.840
 families what they do is launch 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.450
 a brake on indebtedness and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 they try to get out of debt and how can we 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.880
 see there has been a process of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.759
 de-indebtedness 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.729
 2012 makes the total debt of the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.680
 families is 800 35,000 million 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.750
 euros therefore we have lowered this 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.210
 debt let's see now what part of 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.729
 this debt is what corresponds to the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.079
 debt for housing acquisition 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.100
 fundamentally we already see that if we take 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.920
 base year 2012 642 thou million 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.340
 of those 835 billion euros 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.110
 corresponds to debt for acquisition and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.119
 housing rehabilitation therefore a 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.250
 great component is in what would be 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.939
 to understand us in a clear language 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.099
 the mortgages on this I will affect 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.409
 right away but first let's see which one 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.060
 has been the evolution of debt by 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.509
 acquisition of housing from households and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.810
 families since 2005 449 thousand 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.610
 million euros until the year 2012 642 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.700
 one billion euros here is a 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.430
 growth that is completely aligned 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.579
 with what is the indebtedness of the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.590
 families the debt reaches 655 thousand 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.720
 million euros but nevertheless the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.520
 debt for housing acquisition 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.860
 finds its high point 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.930
 2010 with almost six hundred sixty-three 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.030
 billion euros and now 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.980
 Abandoning but of course what is the problem 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.910
 that there is the problem that there is now that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.370
 we have families that like not all 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.970
 work we have entire families that 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.380
 they are all unemployed, we have a 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.240
 families that are unfortunately 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.490
 living on the grandfather's pension in 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.290
 concrete would be 300,000 families in 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.600
 Spain and that means that if there is not 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.340
 I work therefore the risk of being 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.320
 in debt when you have no work and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.970
 when you have no income or when 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.490
 your income decreases considerably 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.650
 is very high, that's why we now have a 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.750
 problem of what mortgages would be 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.340
 the evictions that you have to try 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.500
 avoid it and above all I would say that at 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.860
 margin of claims that have 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.720
 and popular legislative initiatives 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.550
 of the people to try to amend the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.030
 things I think there would be something that would be 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.040
 vital that it would be to look for a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.390
 neutralization in matter say 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.600
 settlement of the debt therefore 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.200
 set a period that on the clock is 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.020
 stop so that in this way there is a 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.720
 lengthening in it 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.820
 of debt settlement and in 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.860
 consequence we tie a little bit what 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.920
 it would be that neutralization with a 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.080
 recovery of our economy greetings 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.430
 encouragement there and always remember that the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.430
 enthusiasm in abundance
