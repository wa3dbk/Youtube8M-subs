 presently 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349

 the remaining matches strive for me 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.789
 you know i'm filing a cassation 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.079
 as studies have shown within 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.649
 created as shown to us at the very 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.349
 Krasnodar on the second plan 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.819
 for country 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.899
 acad ak popular 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.899
 but 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.439
 being tested 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.549
 to 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.549
 in the show 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.329

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
 for the latest news 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.590
 but not much 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.590
 on Monday

 in the text 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 Doll 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.999
 but 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
 generally 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 is 136 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.770
 Russia is 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.190
 the most likely candidate 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.319
 if i'm not exactly like that 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.319
 present 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.430
 subsequently it is understood 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.430
 5'th of July 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.830

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.550
 recession 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.119
 process 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:39.839
 character 

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.330
 did not have 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.860
 now with that kind of broadband face 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.929
 them 

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:46.360
 either yet 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.069
 a little bit a little bit a little bit 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.569
 a little bit a little bit a little bit 

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.020
 a little bit a little bit 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.960
 now the project 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.960
 short list 

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:05.699
