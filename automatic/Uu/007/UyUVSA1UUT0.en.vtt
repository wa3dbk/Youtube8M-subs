00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.779
 It seems capable of subjecting you to no harm 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.669
 but what would happen if the earth 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.949
 was populated by monsters 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.720

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.470
 first place is to back a few 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 centuries 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.600
 until you reach the ancient civilization 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 Aztec at that time and the natives 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.390
 originals of the current territory of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.480
 Mexico worshiped a known deity 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.300
 like that chad qualls the origin of his 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.920
 name part of the annual which means that 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.950
 is the bird of beautiful plumage and coral and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.480
 it means snake deriving in what 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.960
 which is commonly referred to as the 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.550
 plumed serpent this deity was a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 of the most popular in the tradition 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.750
 pre-Hispanic and refers to the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 union of rainwater and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.340
 terrestrial which among the peoples 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 agricultural products was indispensable for 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 survival so it marked the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 origin of life itself 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.280
 it is undeniable that if the natives of that 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.409
 area gave sacred importance to the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.479
 figure of the snake is because 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.940
 possibly coexisted with species 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.700
 giants of this animal in any 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.170
 case the reality is that the legends e 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.970
 stories about monstrous 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.810
 giant snakes spread by 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.179
 the entire American continent so the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.940
 natives of the amazonas' talk about the jac 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.130
 human a snake that could measure 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.920
 according to stories up to 50 meters 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.540
 Long he changed the course of rivers and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.570
 whole human places 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.550
 the inhabitants of the amazonas still believe 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.450
 firmly in the existence of the mythical 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.450
 jacques human 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.549
 the western explorers soon 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.769
 they were aware of these legends 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.140
 and in general the majority considered that in 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.940
 reality the yacumama never existed and the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.599
 Natives only made a description 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.459
 mythified of the known anaconda this 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.030
 idea however was against chosen 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.040
 during the year 1906 at that time the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.099
 famous explorer commander percy 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.620
 Fawcett claimed to have met 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.870
 a giant anaconda while traveling 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.879
 down the Amazon River shot the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.879
 creature and watched as he agonizes 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.950
 but even when there are doubts about whether 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.140
 once there was mythical and I burned 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.500
 more than there is no gender of 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.470
 doubts is about the existence by the area 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.659
 of different historical moments in the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.359
 which snakes of different 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.370
 absolutely huge dimensions 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.400
 that in our days would be considered 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.489
 authentic monsters existed a 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.819
 example of this is the case of the appointment 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.819
 novoa 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.960
 paleontologists of the smithsonian institute 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.600
 of tropical research and the museum 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.350
 of natural history of florida 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.980
 they found the fossil of the snake 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.410
 12 years ago in the cerrejÃ³n mine in 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.960
 Colombia the largest fossil deposit 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.540
 of the world after five years of 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.040
 expedition the find was the first 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.590
 mega fossil forest evidence 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.150
 modern tropical is the most snake 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.850
 great that has existed in the family of 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.830
 the boas lived in lakes and killed their 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.560
 victims choking and eating 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.690
 the whole ones you think you could measure 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.850
 between 12 and 14 meters 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.800
 replica versions of the animal have been 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.800
 exhibited in different parts of the world 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.100
 as you can see when we talk about 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.230
 the biggest snake in the world 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.960
 we can affirm with diversity rum 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.780
 historical that its existence was something more 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.730
 that a legend can only be discussed 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.830
 if these monsters of the past still 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.950
 they feed the human being even if 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.680
 were we understand that they do not want to be left 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.650
 see since the human being has become 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.770
 very dangerous last
