 which came out very recently you are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 probably not 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.430
 without ignoring it a lot of changes 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.700

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.939

 me they are many the game is 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.250
 become we'll say I want to say 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 exploitable today and that makes 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.880
 pleasure since we did not know too much 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 what to do with this version 2012 I 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.390
 come on you have in a version that you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 If you can rate is not finished 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
 but capcom have worked well and pulled out 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 a game that pleases today 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.680
 to players in the gaming community 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 fight shot and well in order to you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.899
 familiarize with butts and ken 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.270
 maybe if you have not had 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.610
 the opportunity to play the 2012 version 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.149
 well I will try to give you 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.539
 the scent of all this but to illustrate 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.920
 and well precisely this update I 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.930
 offers you a little match in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
 exclusivity between alex eve know 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.300
 the American champion of Aaron among the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 darons and suddenly another player 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.200
 american both are pretty good on 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.890
 three weekends and play characters 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.100
 we will say quite conventional since 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.719
 the saint very used in the teams 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.479
 current this staff with a character 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.549
 became a tekken 6 1 if I remember 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.740
 well I do not say nonsense has 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.569
 actually really a whole bunch 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.210
 of arguments very very very convincing 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.189
 he plays it with water in front of the jeans and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.840
 or you see me it's double it's the 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.030
 double chooz early we could say like 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 that the tekken shoto and the castle of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.250
 street fighter ii to shots that plays a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.990
 ultra simple a 120mm launch did not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 managed to link and down small dots 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.080
 just after you have to know that the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 tekken characters have a lot target combo 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.840
 this is the second target combo but at 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.149
 place to do we would see in his target 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.660
 and well water only keep it here 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.640
 alex berg and suddenly and well he could 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.430
 to punish is most of the time that kind 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.579
 many hits and very very very good 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.380
 this crowd still boils this combo that has 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.299
 included directly insults tumbling 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.920
 sellers are there who with double you this 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.190
 combo low medium punchline big dots 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.720
 enameled the end you had a super charles 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.670
 immediately canceled which allows who 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.330
 takes the advantage by cons he deprives her 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.310
 this 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.630
 san who give birth or a little stupidly 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.120
 here to pick it up 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.710
 giving the first haroun to alex veiled 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 a little pity a lot of things from 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.220
 anyway you did not understand everything at 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.180
 what happens on the screen and what I 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.560
 say on this cross tekken do you in 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.850
 do not kill their way too bad it 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.140
 will be much simpler all that we 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.820
 will still have with big dragon points 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.320
 it's not a very strong jungle combo 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.610
 tells the dash then he ends up intel 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.430
 this maquis but got back in the corner 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.110
 the phase with the rider each time 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.460
 well macabre who ends up anyway by that 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.290
 little big point debate big big points 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.070
 points and under cancels with voice 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.800
 means point rn3 the cros art that goes 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.400
 go out especially for fidae the barouge 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.019
 of his opponent and lot 2 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.180
 alex berg finds himself almost 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.769
 want to see success there it's just 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.940
 noka sure never since hot sand 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.570
 who 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.510
 of water controls allows but with 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.400
 a disturbing ease of breaking everything 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.870
 the erika who came back here with 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.820
 like the bar of life that go back to it 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.890
 there are some who play with young people 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.570
 that alex eve is playing without gm before this 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.160
 part it's still it's going live 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.750
 must know how to exploit to find oneself 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 quickly stop obliged tags and his big 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.930
 point our is because if you 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.640
 switchez like that the two characters 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.500
 middle of the screen it's eminently past 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.350
 and bad to get into an infinite of 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.030
 congo tepepan with a recap and the 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.450
 ncaa sylvie of the laughing rail art super 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.490
 and bongrain who laughs in the dances 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.880
 except that before but a little 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.870
 cross in mitis well the mystery of 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.820
 the ars to make bobo dragon text because 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.640
 that in addition there is a dragon if not that 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.340
 is not funny that he took in the 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.730
 teeth forgive me for that and a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:27.260
 victory without 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:30.930
 we will say without too much control 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.060
 two very hung part for alex 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
 eve see the fangs this tekken it's 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.220
 more times over it's more about helping 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.590
 odd combos that lasts at infinity is 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.110
 of the congo which are sometimes shortened for 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.670
 to do a very bad game very oriented on 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.880
 trampling is called lÃ© 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:51.930
 football if a game that has gained greatly in 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.330
 interests in any case and that's what 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.710
 days here are two demonstrated in the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.180
 next marc passante will amplify when 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.690
 a part devoted to these cars 4 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.060
 with a lot of replay that I found 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.200
 pia well well fresh well hot so much 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.450
 more than a big news about 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.520
 street fighter iv right now with at the 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.710
 times this weekend the tournament in kuwait 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.330
 Sheikh GuÃ¨ye I do not know how many 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.650
 Japanese players it's amazing they 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.500
 invented all that they invited all 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.210
 japan but also the new big n which i 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.590

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.110
 the qualifications have passed a 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.250
 tournament let's say the second division

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.870
 in Japan with games very very very 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.990
 interesting all that will be in dying 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.670
