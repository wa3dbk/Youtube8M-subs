again that's right that's right say 35
and<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.660> thought<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.870> myself<00:00:07.020> why<00:00:07.500> not<00:00:07.680> do<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
and I thought to myself why not do a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.419 
and I thought to myself why not do a
commentary<00:00:08.870> right<00:00:09.870> before<00:00:10.200> school<00:00:10.320> starts<00:00:10.769> so

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
commentary right before school starts so

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.580 
commentary right before school starts so
that's<00:00:11.759> pretty<00:00:11.969> much<00:00:12.059> what<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.420> doing<00:00:12.719> we're

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that's pretty much what I'm doing we're

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.499 
that's pretty much what I'm doing we're
using<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> filled<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.000> suppressor

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
using some and filled with a suppressor

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.410 
using some and filled with a suppressor
that's<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.500> suppressor<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.180> gun

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
that's right suppressor because this gun

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.150 
that's right suppressor because this gun
is<00:00:18.630> beast<00:00:19.050> i<00:00:19.320> mean<00:00:19.470> i<00:00:19.560> don't<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.800> why<00:00:19.949> more

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
is beast i mean i don't know why more

people<00:00:20.310> don't<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> i<00:00:21.119> guess<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.660> get

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
people don't use it i guess they get

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.699 
um so yeah weapon balance is very
important<00:03:17.239> however<00:03:17.420> we<00:03:18.079> also<00:03:18.109> have<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.560> keep

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
important however we also have to keep

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.160 
important however we also have to keep
the<00:03:18.859> variety<00:03:19.480> everybody<00:03:20.480> knows<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.019> this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
the variety everybody knows that in this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.990 
the variety everybody knows that in this
real<00:03:21.350> world<00:03:21.650> there<00:03:21.950> are<00:03:21.980> weapons<00:03:22.579> that<00:03:22.819> are

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
real world there are weapons that are

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.090 
real world there are weapons that are
better<00:03:23.180> than<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.630> then<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.290> guess<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.889> rest

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
better than it then I guess the rest

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.460 
better than it then I guess the rest
like<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.090> cannot<00:03:26.359> compare<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.780> infield<00:03:27.260> to

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
like you cannot compare the infield to

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.559 
like you cannot compare the infield to
to<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.310> farmers<00:03:28.639> I<00:03:28.819> mean<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.000> can<00:03:29.180> use<00:03:29.299> both<00:03:29.510> of

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
to the farmers I mean I can use both of

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.379 
to the farmers I mean I can use both of
them<00:03:29.810> fine<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> farmers<00:03:31.609> is<00:03:31.790> better<00:03:32.150> I

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
them fine but the farmers is better I

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.180 
them fine but the farmers is better I
mean<00:03:32.569> it<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> better<00:03:33.109> weapon<00:03:33.350> soon<00:03:33.680> why<00:03:34.010> not

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
mean it is a better weapon soon why not

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.789 
mean it is a better weapon soon why not
reflected<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:34.850> video<00:03:35.359> games<00:03:35.690> why<00:03:36.139> not<00:03:36.380> reflect

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799

reflected in video games why not reflect
any<00:03:36.889> video<00:03:37.220> games<00:03:37.519> because<00:03:37.940> then<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.480> people

like<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.289> Enfield<00:04:24.740> odm<00:04:25.220> 14<00:04:25.640> or<00:04:25.849> the<00:04:25.940> FA

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
like the Enfield odm 14 or the FA

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.610 
like the Enfield odm 14 or the FA
and<00:04:26.610> they're<00:04:26.759> gonna<00:04:26.880> suck<00:04:27.180> ass<00:04:27.500> that's<00:04:28.500> pretty

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
and they're gonna suck ass that's pretty

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.730 
and they're gonna suck ass that's pretty
much<00:04:28.800> my<00:04:29.040> main<00:04:29.190> point<00:04:29.460> we<00:04:30.060> have<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.710> strike<00:04:31.710> a

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
much my main point we have to strike a

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.730 
much my main point we have to strike a
good<00:04:31.860> balance<00:04:32.040> between<00:04:32.660> weapons<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.960> you

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
good balance between weapons and you

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.249 
good balance between weapons and you
know<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.039> user<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.400> guess<00:04:35.699> because<00:04:36.690> if<00:04:37.020> it's

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
know the user I guess because if it's

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.409 
know the user I guess because if it's
not<00:04:37.350> going<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.740> be<00:04:37.830> struck<00:04:38.699> like<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> direct

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
not going to be struck like the direct

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.540 
not going to be struck like the direct
balance<00:04:39.979> then<00:04:40.979> we're<00:04:41.130> going<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> get<00:04:41.400> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
balance then we're going to get the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.810 
balance then we're going to get the
pharmacist<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.330> ak-74<00:04:42.840> use<00:04:43.259> the<00:04:43.620> MDU<00:04:44.130> NPS<00:04:44.639> da

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
