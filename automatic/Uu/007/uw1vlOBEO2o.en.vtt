the<00:00:09.210> beat<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.420> dragons<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.230> show<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.469> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the beat of dragons to show you this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.039 
the beat of dragons to show you this
because<00:00:10.950> Ruby

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
because Ruby

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.450 
because Ruby
looks<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.290> she's<00:00:13.530> laying<00:00:13.799> her<00:00:13.950> eggs<00:00:15.199> yeah

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.720 

she<00:00:20.460> has<00:00:20.699> been<00:00:20.939> actually<00:00:21.359> digging<00:00:21.570> around

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
she has been actually digging around

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.900 
she has been actually digging around
last<00:00:23.730> few<00:00:24.000> days<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.369> yeah<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.550> probably

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
last few days so yeah this is probably

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.530 
last few days so yeah this is probably
her<00:00:29.750> final<00:00:30.750> dig<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.050> would<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:32.700> watered

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

the like I pretty much gave everything
of<00:00:36.960> water<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> other<00:00:37.559> day<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> harden<00:00:38.670> up

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of water the other day just to harden up

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.470 
of water the other day just to harden up
the<00:00:38.910> sand<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.680> some<00:00:40.710> structure

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
the sand like so it's got some structure

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
the sand like so it's got some structure
so<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.820> pretty

much like untouched so that'll give her

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.439 
much like untouched so that'll give her
some<00:00:51.059> nice<00:00:51.239> structure<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.969> everything<00:00:53.969> for

everything you can see her like maybe by

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
everything you can see her like maybe by

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
putting the sand back in and burying the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.969 
putting the sand back in and burying the
eggs<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.820> I'll<00:01:18.060> start<00:01:18.960> recording<00:01:19.140> another

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
eggs and I'll start recording another

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
eggs and I'll start recording another
segment<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.259> I'll<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.530> back<00:01:23.270> okay<00:01:24.270> guys<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
segment so I'll be back okay guys so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.789 
segment so I'll be back okay guys so
it's<00:01:25.080> been<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> good<00:01:25.850> 30<00:01:26.850> minutes<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
it's been a good 30 minutes now and

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.890 
it's been a good 30 minutes now and
she's<00:01:28.799> deep<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> hole<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.840> don't<00:01:30.840> think

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
she's deep in the hole I don't think

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.060 
she's deep in the hole I don't think
I'll<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.049> able<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.530> her<00:01:34.619> unless<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I'll be able to see her unless I got a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
I'll be able to see her unless I got a
flashlight<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.790> don't<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.290> disturb

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
flashlight and I don't want to disturb

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
flashlight and I don't want to disturb
her<00:01:37.530> too<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.490> thought<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.820> might

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
her too much so I just thought I might

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.090 
her too much so I just thought I might
show<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.560> she's<00:01:40.740> fully<00:01:41.509> fully<00:01:42.509> under

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.200 

Scooby<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.610> there

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
Scooby is just up there

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.860 
Scooby is just up there
which<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:49.930> good<00:01:50.110> because<00:01:50.230> he<00:01:50.440> was<00:01:50.770> actually

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
which is good because he was actually

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.630 
which is good because he was actually
head<00:01:52.870> bobbing<00:01:53.200> before<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.920> now<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.490> just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
head bobbing before and now it's just

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.160 
head bobbing before and now it's just
relaxed<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.210> that's<00:01:55.390> probably<00:01:55.600> why<00:01:55.840> she's

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
relaxed so that's probably why she's

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.600 
relaxed so that's probably why she's
decided<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.770> lay<00:01:56.890> them<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:58.740> yeah<00:01:59.740> I'll<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:00.340> back

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
decided to lay them so yeah I'll be back

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
decided to lay them so yeah I'll be back
once<00:02:01.000> uh<00:02:01.380> once<00:02:02.380> she's<00:02:02.590> poked<00:02:02.860> her<00:02:02.979> head<00:02:03.010> out

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
looking pretty thin I guess um I'm just

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.590 
looking pretty thin I guess um I'm just
gonna<00:02:27.730> hang<00:02:27.970> back<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.570> bit<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.630> just<00:02:31.660> wait

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
gonna hang back for a bit and just wait

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.960 
gonna hang back for a bit and just wait
for<00:02:34.600> her<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.900> make<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> move<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.700> pretty

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
for her to make a move it's pretty

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.770 
for her to make a move it's pretty
interesting<00:02:40.860> watching<00:02:41.860> them<00:02:42.660> hopefully<00:02:43.660> I'm

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
interesting watching them hopefully I'm

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.860 
interesting watching them hopefully I'm
not<00:02:43.810> stressing<00:02:44.770> her<00:02:44.980> out<00:02:45.630> by<00:02:46.630> watching<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
not stressing her out by watching but I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.300 
not stressing her out by watching but I
think<00:02:49.870> she<00:02:50.020> should<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.350> okay

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.440 

women

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.470 

who's<00:02:58.990> nothing<00:02:59.310> all<00:03:00.310> she<00:03:00.550> hears<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.849> plane

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.490 

I<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:04.080> where<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.319> is

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.070 

they<00:03:08.070> react<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.730> planes<00:03:09.860> like<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:12.080> can
