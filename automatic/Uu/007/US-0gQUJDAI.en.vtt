the first tablet pc makers to release
the<00:01:54.060> rock<00:01:54.329> chip<00:01:54.570> RK<00:01:54.930> 3288<00:01:55.619> cpu<00:01:56.240> one<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the rock chip RK 3288 cpu one of the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.740 
the rock chip RK 3288 cpu one of the
cool<00:01:57.540> things<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.159> RK<00:01:59.159> 3288<00:02:00.149> cpu<00:02:00.570> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
cool things about the RK 3288 cpu is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.800 
cool things about the RK 3288 cpu is
that<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> has<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.439> believe<00:02:01.469> 16<00:02:02.189> core<00:02:02.850> GPU<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that it has I believe 16 core GPU so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.830 
that it has I believe 16 core GPU so
it's<00:02:04.079> great<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.380> gaming<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:06.600> is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it's great for gaming and it is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.520 
it's great for gaming and it is
quad-core<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.310> 3288<00:02:09.179> cpu<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.869> quad-core<00:02:10.170> but

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
quad-core the 3288 cpu is quad-core but

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.309 
quad-core the 3288 cpu is quad-core but
i<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.860> clocks<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:11.790> point

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
i think it clocks in about one point

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.009 
i think it clocks in about one point
takes<00:02:12.439> a<00:02:12.560> 1.7<00:02:13.280> gigahertz<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:13.939> it's<00:02:14.090> faster<00:02:14.989> and

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
takes a 1.7 gigahertz so it's faster and

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.619 
takes a 1.7 gigahertz so it's faster and
more<00:02:15.200> stable<00:02:15.319> or<00:02:15.680> than<00:02:15.859> the<00:02:16.099> ratchet<00:02:16.549> 3188<00:02:17.239> and

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
more stable or than the ratchet 3188 and

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.369 
more stable or than the ratchet 3188 and
as<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.189> on<00:02:19.219> 22<00:02:19.639> likes<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.359> p4<00:02:20.749> and<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
as you see on 22 likes the p4 and it

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.610 
as you see on 22 likes the p4 and it
gets<00:02:21.499> a<00:02:21.620> mazing<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.730> great<00:02:22.969> score<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.590> 40<00:02:25.209> 1825

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
gets a mazing a great score of a 40 1825

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.729 
gets a mazing a great score of a 40 1825
great<00:02:27.620> score<00:02:27.889> above<00:02:29.260> forty<00:02:30.260> forty-one

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
great score above forty forty-one

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.399 
great score above forty forty-one
thousand<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> p9<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.109> gets<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
thousand and this on the p9 it gets a

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.629 
thousand and this on the p9 it gets a
40,000<00:02:35.019> 738<00:02:36.189> so<00:02:37.189> let's<00:02:37.370> check<00:02:37.519> out<00:02:37.609> the

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
40,000 738 so let's check out the

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.420 
40,000 738 so let's check out the
details<00:02:37.849> on<00:02:38.239> both<00:02:38.389> of<00:02:38.419> these<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:39.280> we'll<00:02:40.280> bring

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
details on both of these and we'll bring

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.000 
details on both of these and we'll bring
each<00:02:40.790> other<00:02:41.349> results<00:02:42.349> up<00:02:42.499> close<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.859> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
each other results up close to the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.479 
each other results up close to the
screen<00:02:43.219> so<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.519> see<00:02:44.859> okay<00:02:45.859> so<00:02:45.919> one<00:02:46.370> thing

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
screen so you can see okay so one thing

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.530 
screen so you can see okay so one thing
I<00:02:46.549> forgot<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:46.819> mention<00:02:46.939> is<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.299> both<00:02:47.510> of

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
I forgot to mention is that both of

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.300 
I forgot to mention is that both of
these<00:02:47.719> tablets<00:02:48.049> are<00:02:48.230> running<00:02:48.500> Android<00:02:48.769> 4.4

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
these tablets are running Android 4.4

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.459 
these tablets are running Android 4.4
KitKat<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:53.569> trying<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.019> are<00:02:54.109> four<00:02:54.290> point

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
KitKat so trying to and are four point

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.849 
KitKat so trying to and are four point
four<00:02:54.620> point<00:02:54.680> four<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.959> two<00:02:56.959> gigabytes<00:02:57.349> ddr3

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
four point four and two gigabytes ddr3

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.159 
four point four and two gigabytes ddr3
RAM<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.489> about<00:02:58.760> 1.1<00:02:59.389> gigabyte<00:02:59.840> it's<00:02:59.930> free

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
RAM with about 1.1 gigabyte it's free

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.709 
RAM with about 1.1 gigabyte it's free
and<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:01.519> quad<00:03:01.819> coordinate<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.389> says<00:03:02.599> is

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:02.719 
and it's quad coordinate this says is

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.770 
and it's quad coordinate this says is
clocking<00:03:03.049> at<00:03:03.139> one<00:03:03.290> 1.8<00:03:03.949> giga<00:03:04.099> hertz<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.780> that's

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
clocking at one 1.8 giga hertz so that's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.839 
clocking at one 1.8 giga hertz so that's
the<00:03:06.079> main<00:03:06.290> thing<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.829> okay<00:03:07.159> there<00:03:07.730> are<00:03:07.819> a

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
the main thing is like okay there are a

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.179 
the main thing is like okay there are a
lot<00:03:07.969> of<00:03:08.000> octa-core<00:03:08.449> tablet<00:03:08.629> cell<00:03:09.079> but<00:03:09.500> they're

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
lot of octa-core tablet cell but they're

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.920 
lot of octa-core tablet cell but they're
only<00:03:10.340> clocking<00:03:10.699> in<00:03:10.760> about<00:03:10.939> 1.7<00:03:11.329> you<00:03:11.689> get<00:03:11.810> hurt

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
only clocking in about 1.7 you get hurt

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.300 
only clocking in about 1.7 you get hurt
so<00:03:12.079> actually<00:03:12.409> even<00:03:13.010> though<00:03:13.069> this<00:03:13.129> is<00:03:13.250> only

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
so actually even though this is only

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.899 
so actually even though this is only
quad-core<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.269> rockchip<00:03:15.159> rk3188<00:03:16.159> cpu<00:03:16.819> is

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
quad-core the rockchip rk3188 cpu is

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.170 
quad-core the rockchip rk3188 cpu is
faster<00:03:17.329> than<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:17.810> octa<00:03:18.109> core<00:03:18.139> cpus<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> we

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
faster than the octa core cpus so we

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.339 
faster than the octa core cpus so we
have<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.389> update<00:03:20.479> our<00:03:20.629> description<00:03:21.109> on<00:03:21.169> that

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
have to update our description on that

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:29.259 
have to update our description on that
the<00:03:22.069> GPU<00:03:22.430> mali<00:03:22.669> 87<00:03:24.099> 64th<00:03:25.269> GPU<00:03:28.030> let's<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.150> go

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
the GPU mali 87 64th GPU let's just go

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.080 
the GPU mali 87 64th GPU let's just go
to<00:03:29.349> tablet<00:03:30.349> details<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.099> we'll<00:03:31.909> probably

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
to tablet details and we'll probably

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:44.360 
to tablet details and we'll probably
just<00:03:32.209> zone<00:03:32.509> will<00:03:32.810> zoom<00:03:32.989> in<00:03:33.169> for<00:03:34.810> oops

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.199 

so<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.860> checkout<00:03:46.860> device<00:03:47.190> about<00:03:47.819> device

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.119 

device<00:03:51.209> info<00:03:51.569> that<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.989> ok<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:52.799> we're<00:03:53.040> actually

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
device info that is ok so we're actually

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.369 
device info that is ok so we're actually
just<00:03:53.340> zoom<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.730> little<00:03:53.879> bit<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.930> don't

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
just zoom in a little bit so I don't

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.479 
just zoom in a little bit so I don't
have<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.500> hold<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.799> up<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:58.280> ok<00:03:59.280> i<00:03:59.310> want

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
have to hold it up like that ok i want

check out the rom info so you can see

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.719 
check out the rom info so you can see
that<00:05:47.260> this<00:05:47.410> even<00:05:47.740> gets<00:05:47.889> a<00:05:48.130> higher<00:05:48.370> score<00:05:48.580> than

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729

it then the HTC and Samsung so that's

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.659
