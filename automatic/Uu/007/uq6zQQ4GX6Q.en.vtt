00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.230
 Hello, I heard that such a short 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.810
 pyramid up remotely now in 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.820
 the internet talks a lot about it in 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.400
 every hall in the city 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.460
 food in russia are all crazy about crossfit and 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.220
 I decided to find out that this is more detailed zine 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.830
 hello 3 is fine as the mood is very 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.659
 good i want to ask you heard 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.479
 the word crossfit and the word of course 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.300
 heard never tried 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.970
 just honest pioneer word 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.580
 you run crossfit is complicated lazy 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.400
 but as far as I heard it is folded here 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.449
 because it's not checked here 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.100
 functionality your muscles then 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.510
 there is everything here that I pumped up and in the hall yes 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.940
 all that I did now with him and in real 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.430
 Well, we can not check all the stash salute 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.590
 hello there is never a crossfit goal 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.630
 the first time we are so little 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.970
 They compete with each other as in thinking 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.800
 of whom there is always a greater chance 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.420
 always dreamed of myself more likely so 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 that i put myself 1 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.660
 at least I did your hello hi 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.600
 Here I look at you and I think that you 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.160
 every day you do it just like that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 ozruzki day only his own 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.150
 short form is running 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.270
 not at first difficult then a second wind 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.930
 something opens up above that fits that 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:42.560
 here on the second and if the road between 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.560
 legs yourself 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.010
 it is very important to consider tactics and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.360
 distribute power and there is of course 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.900
 some exercise that turns out 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.840
 easier 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.410
 but there is something more difficult 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.630
 for example, he lacks attacks 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.320
 endurance and bear for what is 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.660
 stretch marks squeeze easier more 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.640
 engage in more stamina and 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.620
 correct tactics distribution friends i 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.459
 I want to tell you here before this 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.489
 workout up 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.570
 duets i thought i just know everything 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.000
 muscle failure 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.650
 that zina you can endure the pain you 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.900
 working the last 10 reps 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.550
 squats at all through the pain if 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.190
 you work there for 1825 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.320
 you are fine with stamina and 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.990
 so at least give all the best 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.300
 you know so that's not enough for me not breathing 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.400
 and friends I learned the questions what is 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.580
 real muscle rejection he's real 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.229
 he is and you just do not get up here 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.630
 from zina zina come on and do you understand what 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.240
 giving you nothing with legs 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.740
 refused and you crawl just now 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.740
 as a finish line 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.180
 On the program I will turn it on necessarily 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.720
 at least once every two weeks or once 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.360
 a week 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.060
 because because the knife I understood 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.580
 what will it give me the opportunity to work 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.949
 then with big weights with the same 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.900
 number of repetitions or with the same 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.789
 most forests but more 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.860
 repetitions because my friends here 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.319
 this is the most muscular failure here 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.509
 completely different meaning you go out just 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.000
 beyond plus more competitive 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.879
 Effect 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.139
 hard actually exhausted long ago 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.370
 there were such loads and really 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:36.889
 loads that seemed marginal 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:40.310
 they are not really extreme 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:43.949
 you need an employee at 10 or all 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.050
 for some reason this will win and inside you 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.120
 constantly train well minutes to on 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.550
 I have been training for two months 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.639
 endurance and in principle it instilled 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.460
 circle ball can be high hopes in front 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.830
 so how do we meet here so 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.169
 my almost daily runs were given 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.409
 myself know the principle prepared by me 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.330
 thought it would be worse 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.629
 principle struck well of course were 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.699
 technology shortcomings he saw yes there 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:14.009
 someone tried to circumvent someone tried 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.199
 but unfinished principle but you said 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.080
 that girl is no more enduring than that 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.909
 why so well this is originally what 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.580
 in men the predominance of the power of women 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.620
 endurance and principle 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.839
 power complexes and more gymnastic 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.089
 and the girls endurance gave the keys 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:32.610
 men can recommend to someone 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.060
 cross is for everyone or is it still not for 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.159
 of all 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.839
 Well, a person should be more or less 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.300
 prepared all the same you understand for 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.909
 some kind of physical development must be 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.710
 Well, figuratively speaking, a good test man 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.610
 should do 50 sit-ups there and time 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.419
 50 pushups 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.069
 yes at least like this without rest because 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.110
 what if a person can't do 50 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:54.029
 clear squats yourself understand what 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.370
 complex you can not scale everything 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:58.080
 you need to lead a person to this 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.120
 but man must have some kind of base 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.039
 so basically people come who 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.120
 at least either in the simulator or yes and there 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:07.300
 played sports and thank you very much 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.720
 held complexes girls you 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:16.290
 thanks do crossfit my name is 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.290
 Dmitry I am 24 years old and this video cycle 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.330
 Today I will try to briefly tell 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:27.240
 I came then reached for his sport 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.240
 small experience and what goals I see in the future 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.139
 began to put
