strategies on how to get a scholarship

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.410

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
so let's get started

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.290 
so let's get started
strategy<00:00:17.080> number<00:00:17.260> one<00:00:17.590> I<00:00:17.800> know<00:00:18.670> what<00:00:19.180> you're

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
strategy number one I know what you're

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.090 
strategy number one I know what you're
thinking<00:00:19.690> you<00:00:20.230> should<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:20.710> should<00:00:20.740> apply<00:00:21.010> for

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
thinking you should you should apply for

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.950 
thinking you should you should apply for
all<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.430> scholarships<00:00:22.030> you<00:00:22.090> can<00:00:22.150> but<00:00:22.780> that's

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
all the scholarships you can but that's

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.230 
all the scholarships you can but that's
not<00:00:23.260> actually<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.860> good<00:00:24.100> strategy<00:00:24.580> you<00:00:25.030> should

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
not actually a good strategy you should

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.150 
not actually a good strategy you should
narrow<00:00:25.570> down<00:00:25.690> the<00:00:26.320> scholarships<00:00:26.860> that<00:00:27.010> you're

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
narrow down the scholarships that you're

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.040 
narrow down the scholarships that you're
applying<00:00:27.370> for<00:00:27.640> because<00:00:28.300> there's<00:00:28.630> some<00:00:28.870> that

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
applying for because there's some that

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.450 
applying for because there's some that
are<00:00:29.110> more<00:00:29.320> competitive<00:00:29.650> than<00:00:29.920> others

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
are more competitive than others

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.280 
are more competitive than others
you<00:00:30.730> have<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.940> national<00:00:31.450> state<00:00:31.720> local<00:00:32.140> level

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
you have the national state local level

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.700 
you have the national state local level
scholarships<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:33.399> my<00:00:34.120> advice<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.480> you<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:35.050> to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
scholarships so my advice to you is to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.619 
scholarships so my advice to you is to
narrow<00:00:36.010> it<00:00:36.190> down<00:00:36.250> for<00:00:36.730> example<00:00:37.149> if<00:00:37.300> you're<00:00:37.600> a

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
narrow it down for example if you're a

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.930 
narrow it down for example if you're a
hispanic<00:00:38.440> basketball<00:00:39.010> player<00:00:39.249> and<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.670> find

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
hispanic basketball player and you find

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.180 
hispanic basketball player and you find
a<00:00:40.059> scholarship<00:00:40.420> for<00:00:40.719> that<00:00:40.899> category<00:00:41.140> go<00:00:41.949> for

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
a scholarship for that category go for

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.369 
a scholarship for that category go for
it<00:00:42.280> because<00:00:42.370> most<00:00:43.089> likely<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:43.629> have<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.989> less

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
it because most likely you have a less

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.110 
it because most likely you have a less
competitive<00:00:44.649> pool<00:00:45.190> you<00:00:45.339> have<00:00:45.370> less<00:00:45.699> people

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
competitive pool you have less people

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.279 
competitive pool you have less people
applying<00:00:46.390> for<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:46.839> that<00:00:46.960> means<00:00:47.079> you<00:00:47.260> have

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
applying for that so that means you have

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.799 
applying for that so that means you have
a<00:00:47.409> greater<00:00:47.769> chance<00:00:47.890> at<00:00:48.429> least<00:00:48.940> for<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.629> most

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
a greater chance at least for the most

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.270 
a greater chance at least for the most
part<00:00:50.079> that<00:00:50.530> might<00:00:50.710> not<00:00:50.800> be<00:00:50.829> true<00:00:51.069> all<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.249> time

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
part that might not be true all the time

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.970 
part that might not be true all the time
but<00:00:52.269> it<00:00:52.569> will<00:00:52.690> increase<00:00:52.989> your<00:00:53.050> chances<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.800> win

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
but it will increase your chances to win

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.939 
but it will increase your chances to win
scholarship<00:00:54.730> money<00:00:54.969> by<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.569> huge<00:00:56.229> amount<00:00:56.499> so

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
scholarship money by a huge amount so

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.029 
scholarship money by a huge amount so
narrowed<00:00:57.460> down<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:59.039> characteristics

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
narrowed down the the characteristics

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.160 
narrowed down the the characteristics
required<00:01:00.280> for<00:01:01.089> that<00:01:01.210> specific<00:01:01.629> scholarship

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
required for that specific scholarship

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.020 
required for that specific scholarship
now<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.649> can<00:01:03.039> give<00:01:03.159> you<00:01:03.249> an<00:01:03.339> example<00:01:03.399> for<00:01:03.850> mine<00:01:03.999> I

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
now I can give you an example for mine I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.690 
now I can give you an example for mine I
want<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> local<00:01:04.750> scholarship<00:01:05.260> there's<00:01:05.830> $500

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
but those those $500 scholarships add up

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.490 
but those those $500 scholarships add up
over<00:01:09.219> time<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:10.329> that's<00:01:10.479> $500<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.229> didn't
