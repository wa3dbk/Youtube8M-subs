that<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.209> common<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.690> that's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
that they have in common in that's

that they have in common in that's
that's<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:35.070> I'm<00:02:35.190> trying<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.670> capture<00:02:35.940> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
that's what I'm trying to capture I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.229 
that's what I'm trying to capture I
don't<00:02:36.750> try<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.959> copy<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.440> drawing<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:38.180> try<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
don't try to copy a drawing I try to

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.690 
don't try to copy a drawing I try to
emulate<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:40.080> certain<00:02:40.560> feeling<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.459> get

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
emulate a certain feeling that I get

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.600 
emulate a certain feeling that I get
from<00:02:41.940> from<00:02:42.720> looking<00:02:42.959> at<00:02:43.080> multiple<00:02:43.709> drawings

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
from from looking at multiple drawings

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.420 
from from looking at multiple drawings
and<00:02:44.850> try<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.810> get<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.290> essence<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.220> is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and try to get the essence that is

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.790 
and try to get the essence that is
common<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.120> all<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.480> them<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.290> our<00:02:49.500> case

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
common in all of them and in our case

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.770 
common in all of them and in our case
here<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.850> way<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.300> forest

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
here it's the the the way the forest

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
here it's the the the way the forest
kind<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.620> blends<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.650> strong

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
kind of blends in as as a strong

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.090 
kind of blends in as as a strong
background<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.620> there's<00:03:01.620> something<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
background and there's something that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.240 
background and there's something that
makes<00:03:02.870> everything<00:03:03.870> especially<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.070> one

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
makes everything especially in this one

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.250 
makes everything especially in this one
here<00:03:06.140> let<00:03:07.140> me<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:08.660> show<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:11.600> see<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:13.049> one

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
here let me just show you see this one

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
scheme and lighting and so on over here

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.690 
scheme and lighting and so on over here
the<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:22.170> way<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.470> trees<00:03:22.769> are<00:03:23.070> kind<00:03:23.610> of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
the the way the trees are kind of

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.360 
the the way the trees are kind of
twirling<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.739> you<00:03:25.739> know<00:03:26.000> warped<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.530> help

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
twirling and you know warped to to help

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.170 
twirling and you know warped to to help
create<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:31.190> feeling<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.910> tense

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.050 
create that to that feeling of a tense
atmosphere<00:03:33.920> over<00:03:34.920> here<00:03:35.190> again<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.579> like<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
atmosphere over here again I like the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.720 
atmosphere over here again I like the
color<00:03:36.360> scheme<00:03:36.600> very<00:03:37.140> much<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.709> um<00:03:38.329> it's<00:03:39.329> very

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
color scheme very much it's um it's very

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.319 
color scheme very much it's um it's very
stylized<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.690> at<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.140> same<00:03:43.320> time<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:44.209> holds<00:03:45.209> a

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
stylized but at the same time it holds a

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.420 
stylized but at the same time it holds a
very<00:03:46.730> visual<00:03:47.730> appeal<00:03:48.560> over<00:03:49.560> here<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
very visual appeal over here the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.090 
very visual appeal over here the
lighting<00:03:50.910> behind<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.690> trees<00:03:55.110> it's

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
lighting behind the the the trees it's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300 
lighting behind the the the trees it's
very<00:03:56.370> interesting<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:57.209> me<00:03:58.130> something<00:03:59.130> that's

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
very interesting to me something that's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.180 
very interesting to me something that's
again<00:03:59.549> very<00:03:59.579> apparent<00:04:00.390> here<00:04:01.290> as<00:04:01.410> well<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:02.040> in

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
again very apparent here as well just in

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.530 
again very apparent here as well just in
a<00:04:02.250> different<00:04:02.610> style<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.180> as<00:04:03.720> well<00:04:03.959> here<00:04:05.540> every

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
every one of these images has something

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.520 
every one of these images has something
that<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.590> want<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.390> keep<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.630> mind<00:04:12.930> when<00:04:13.500> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that I want to keep in mind when I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.719 
that I want to keep in mind when I
create<00:04:14.010> my<00:04:14.220> own<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:16.200> see<00:04:16.530> how<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:17.519> can

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
create my own and to to see how I can

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.659 
create my own and to to see how I can
take<00:04:18.200> tiny<00:04:19.200> bits<00:04:19.560> from<00:04:19.830> here<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.280> there<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
take tiny bits from here and there and

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.930 
take tiny bits from here and there and
try<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.030> create<00:04:21.570> a

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
try to create a

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
try to create a
a<00:04:22.020> whole<00:04:23.020> holy<00:04:23.770> original<00:04:24.550> picture<00:04:25.000> we're

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
a whole holy original picture we're

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.240 
a whole holy original picture we're
going<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.320> keep<00:04:26.530> these<00:04:26.800> into<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.780> merged<00:04:28.780> layer

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
going to keep these into a merged layer

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.800 
going to keep these into a merged layer
and<00:04:30.250> we're<00:04:30.940> gonna<00:04:31.090> call<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:32.940> references<00:04:36.810> and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
and we're gonna call it references and

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.000 
and we're gonna call it references and
we're<00:04:37.960> gonna<00:04:38.080> hide<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.590> for<00:04:38.830> now<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:41.740> wasn't

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
we're gonna hide it for now this wasn't

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.950 
we're gonna hide it for now this wasn't
in<00:04:42.340> plan<00:04:42.640> but<00:04:43.330> next<00:04:43.990> video<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.650> realized<00:04:45.100> that

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
in plan but next video I realized that

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.440 
in plan but next video I realized that
you<00:04:46.960> don't<00:04:47.260> know<00:04:47.500> Photoshop<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.280> next<00:04:48.880> video<00:04:49.210> I

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
you don't know Photoshop so next video I

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.400 
you don't know Photoshop so next video I
will<00:04:49.750> talk<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.260> bit<00:04:50.500> about<00:04:51.750> every<00:04:52.750> every<00:04:53.170> tool

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
will talk a bit about every every tool

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.820 
will talk a bit about every every tool
that<00:04:53.650> we'll<00:04:53.800> be<00:04:53.980> using<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:55.090> interface<00:04:55.540> of

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
that we'll be using and the interface of

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.090 
that we'll be using and the interface of
Photoshop<00:04:56.830> itself<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:58.930> we<00:04:59.290> can<00:04:59.590> make

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
Photoshop itself so that we can make

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.800 
Photoshop itself so that we can make
sure<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.310> we're<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.820> same<00:05:01.000> page<00:05:01.240> so

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
sure that we're on the same page so

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.710 
sure that we're on the same page so
before<00:05:02.170> we<00:05:02.290> get<00:05:02.410> into<00:05:02.740> things<00:05:03.510> that's<00:05:04.510> what

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
before we get into things that's what

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.220 
before we get into things that's what
we'll<00:05:04.900> be<00:05:04.930> looking<00:05:05.530> at<00:05:05.830> next<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:06.640> for<00:05:07.360> now<00:05:07.540> we

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
we'll be looking at next but for now we

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.560 
we'll be looking at next but for now we
have<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.950> concept<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.670> our<00:05:09.790> head<00:05:10.150> we<00:05:10.420> have

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
have the concept in our head we have

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.300 
have the concept in our head we have
some<00:05:10.840> reference<00:05:11.230> pictures<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:11.830> we<00:05:11.920> can<00:05:12.100> use

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
some reference pictures that we can use
