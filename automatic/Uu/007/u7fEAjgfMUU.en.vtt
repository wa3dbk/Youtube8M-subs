for<00:00:14.730> me<00:00:14.879> the<00:00:15.090> draw<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.660> making<00:00:16.320> beautiful

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
for me the draw is making beautiful

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.749 
for me the draw is making beautiful
fabric<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:20.390> try<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.810> work<00:00:22.169> with<00:00:22.349> materials<00:00:22.859> now

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
fabric I try and work with materials now

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.089 
fabric I try and work with materials now
that<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.509> know<00:00:24.660> will<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.529> gave<00:00:25.710> me<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.919> good

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that I know will actually gave me a good

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
that I know will actually gave me a good
color<00:00:26.429> so<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.970> find<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.570> tree<00:00:28.669> that<00:00:29.669> I<00:00:30.199> do

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
color so if I find a tree that I do

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.840 
color so if I find a tree that I do
maybe<00:00:31.409> a<00:00:31.529> small<00:00:31.800> experiment<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> leaves

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
maybe a small experiment with the leaves

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.510 
maybe a small experiment with the leaves
if<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.690> find<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.770> leaf<00:00:35.100> gives<00:00:35.400> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
if I find that that that leaf gives a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.070 
if I find that that that leaf gives a
very<00:00:35.700> good<00:00:35.880> color<00:00:36.060> then<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> will<00:00:36.630> continue<00:00:36.810> to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
very good color then I will continue to

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.130 
very good color then I will continue to
print<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.620> us

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.720 

when<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.170> first<00:00:44.380> came<00:00:44.560> here<00:00:44.770> two<00:00:45.220> clashing<00:00:45.700> I

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
when I first came here two clashing I

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.550 
when I first came here two clashing I
was<00:00:46.060> really<00:00:46.600> really<00:00:46.750> blown<00:00:47.050> away<00:00:47.080> by<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
was really really blown away by the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.540 
was really really blown away by the
landscape<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.990> was<00:00:49.990> luckily<00:00:50.230> able<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.100> buy<00:00:51.250> a

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
landscape I was luckily able to buy a

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.430 
landscape I was luckily able to buy a
little<00:00:51.940> bit<00:00:52.060> of<00:00:52.150> land<00:00:52.330> around<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.930> house

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
little bit of land around the house

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.470 
little bit of land around the house
several<00:00:53.890> years<00:00:54.040> later<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.610> I<00:00:54.700> planted<00:00:55.150> thirty

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
several years later and I planted thirty

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.410 
several years later and I planted thirty
there<00:00:55.720> half<00:00:55.960> thousand<00:00:56.410> trees<00:00:56.680> I<00:00:59.490> think<00:01:00.490> what

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
there half thousand trees I think what

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.049 
there half thousand trees I think what
excites<00:01:01.690> me<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.410> most<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.700> color<00:01:03.970> is

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
excites me the most is that the color is

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.240 
excites me the most is that the color is
cut<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.540> being<00:01:04.930> extracted<00:01:05.290> directly<00:01:05.890> from<00:01:06.070> the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
cut is being extracted directly from the

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.880 
cut is being extracted directly from the
leaves<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.570> each<00:01:07.810> piece<00:01:08.080> is<00:01:08.350> totally

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
leaves and that each piece is totally

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.770 
leaves and that each piece is totally
unique<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.730> that<00:01:09.850> there<00:01:10.030> are<00:01:10.060> no<00:01:10.180> chemicals

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
unique and that there are no chemicals

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.310 
unique and that there are no chemicals
or<00:01:10.990> it's<00:01:11.440> a<00:01:11.500> very<00:01:11.530> natural<00:01:11.830> process

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.469 

I<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.070> great<00:01:18.430> collection<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:19.000> all<00:01:19.120> bits<00:01:19.330> of

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
I have a great collection of all bits of

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.120 
I have a great collection of all bits of
rusty<00:01:19.810> metal<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.320> stuff<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.710> picked<00:01:20.860> them<00:01:21.040> up

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
rusty metal and stuff I picked them up

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.649 
rusty metal and stuff I picked them up
when<00:01:21.340> I'm<00:01:21.430> out<00:01:21.520> walking<00:01:21.760> or<00:01:22.210> down<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.450> my

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
when I'm out walking or down on my

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:30.240 
when I'm out walking or down on my
neighbor's<00:01:22.990> farm<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:27.370> if<00:01:27.520> I'm<00:01:27.720> working<00:01:29.250> with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
neighbor's farm so if I'm working with

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.250 
neighbor's farm so if I'm working with
leaves<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.910> I<00:01:31.000> soak<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> leaves<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.900> rusty

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
leaves and I soak the leaves in rusty

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.410 
leaves and I soak the leaves in rusty
water<00:01:32.470> before<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.520> wrap<00:01:33.850> them<00:01:34.030> up<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
water before I wrap them up in the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.420 
water before I wrap them up in the
textiles<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.170> get<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.410> totally<00:01:35.860> different<00:01:36.220> color

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
textiles I get a totally different color

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:59.160 
textiles I get a totally different color
palette

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:08.190 

I<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:06.100> never<00:02:06.310> ever<00:02:06.460> repeat<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.570> process<00:02:07.780> that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
I can never ever repeat the process that

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.290 
I can never ever repeat the process that
all<00:02:08.380> my<00:02:08.679> pieces<00:02:08.920> are<00:02:09.190> totally<00:02:09.610> different<00:02:10.060> if<00:02:10.209> I

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
all my pieces are totally different if I

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.510 
all my pieces are totally different if I
can<00:02:10.450> use<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.690> same<00:02:10.929> materials<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.310> piece

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
can use the same materials but the piece

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:34.820 
can use the same materials but the piece
itself<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.239> actually<00:02:13.510> different

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.180 

it's<00:02:35.830> exciting<00:02:36.190> when<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.549> open<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:38.739> bundle

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's exciting when I open the the bundle

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.039 
it's exciting when I open the the bundle
when<00:02:39.340> I'm<00:02:39.459> unwrapping<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.299> extremely

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
when I'm unwrapping it it's extremely

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.920 
when I'm unwrapping it it's extremely
exciting<00:02:41.319> because<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.280> never<00:02:42.340> know<00:02:42.790> even<00:02:43.510> with

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
exciting because I never know even with

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.960 
exciting because I never know even with
leaves<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.410> I'm<00:02:44.560> used<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.890> using<00:02:45.160> there<00:02:45.760> are

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
leaves that I'm used to using there are

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:54.539 
leaves that I'm used to using there are
always<00:02:47.310> variables<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:51.700> an<00:02:52.120> actual<00:02:53.549> technique

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
always variables as an actual technique

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.240 
always variables as an actual technique
this<00:02:54.849> is<00:02:55.030> not<00:02:55.329> really<00:02:55.930> his<00:02:56.079> Ireland<00:02:56.620> or<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.890> UK

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
this is not really his Ireland or the UK

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:11.020 
this is not really his Ireland or the UK
at<00:02:57.549> all<00:02:57.970> yeah

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.090 

I'm<00:03:11.540> not<00:03:12.260> even<00:03:12.500> sure<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:13.010> a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
I'm not even sure that it's a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.650 
I'm not even sure that it's a
composition<00:03:13.520> sometimes<00:03:14.209> there's<00:03:14.420> something

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
composition sometimes there's something

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.170 
composition sometimes there's something
appealing<00:03:14.959> about<00:03:15.350> particular<00:03:15.980> pieces<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.910> so

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
appealing about particular pieces and so

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.790 
appealing about particular pieces and so
there<00:03:17.390> are<00:03:17.450> always<00:03:17.569> surprises<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.440> sometimes

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
there are always surprises and sometimes

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.710 
there are always surprises and sometimes
I<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:18.980> open<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.490> piece<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.910> it's<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.209> wow<00:03:20.420> I

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
I just open a piece and it's just wow I

00:03:20.720 --> 00:04:01.450 
I just open a piece and it's just wow I
just<00:03:20.840> love<00:03:21.080> this

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.520
