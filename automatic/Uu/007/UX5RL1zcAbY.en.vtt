00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
explain this one pretty easily a lot of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.220 
explain this one pretty easily a lot of
people<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:35.700> taking<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> replacement

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
people really taking the the replacement

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020 
people really taking the the replacement
reps<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.590> task<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.730> say<00:00:38.910> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
reps to task but I would say it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.970 
reps to task but I would say it's
tampering<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> big<00:00:40.170> stopwatch<00:00:40.649> you've

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
tampering by the big stopwatch you've

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.410 
tampering by the big stopwatch you've
heard<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> Big<00:00:41.370> Pharma<00:00:41.579> big<00:00:42.000> oil<00:00:42.149> big

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
heard of Big Pharma big oil big

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600 
heard of Big Pharma big oil big
stopwatch<00:00:43.290> tampering<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> reps

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
stopwatch tampering with with the reps

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
stopwatch tampering with with the reps
it<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.329> makes<00:00:45.539> sense<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.930> back<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> follow

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it all makes sense go back and follow

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
it all makes sense go back and follow
the<00:00:46.649> money<00:00:46.770> follow<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.670> second<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the money follow the second so not the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
the money follow the second so not the
refs<00:00:48.719> fault<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> refs<00:00:49.440> fault<00:00:49.680> okay
