00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.130 
finger on the rule and taking the third
on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> same<00:00:13.949> string<00:00:14.510> so<00:00:15.510> it's<00:00:16.310> the<00:00:17.310> 50th<00:00:18.140> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
on the same string so it's the 50th and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.780 
on the same string so it's the 50th and
then<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.440> have<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> octave<00:00:20.280> again<00:00:20.520> with<00:00:20.700> the

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
then we have the octave again with the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.900 
then we have the octave again with the
first<00:00:21.030> finger<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.720> means<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.200> move

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
position where you see the notes like

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.950 
position where you see the notes like
this<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.610> picture<00:01:02.879> move<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.150> up<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.330> notch

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
this a picture move it up a notch

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.100 
this a picture move it up a notch
play<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> same<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.570> easy<00:01:07.780> for<00:01:07.990> yourself

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
play the same make it easy for yourself

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.020 
play the same make it easy for yourself
move<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:08.740> up<00:01:08.860> an<00:01:08.979> axle<00:01:09.310> on<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.490> same<00:01:09.759> string

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
move it up an axle on the same string

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.120 
move it up an axle on the same string
using<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.630> same<00:01:10.990> pattern<00:01:11.380> on<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.920> same

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
using the same pattern on the same

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.850 
using the same pattern on the same
strings<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.810> can<00:01:13.930> see<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.410> twelfth<00:01:14.770> fret

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
strings you can see on the twelfth fret

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.139 
strings you can see on the twelfth fret
if<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.750> have<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.460> open<00:01:18.790> E<00:01:18.910> it's

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
if we have the the the open E it's

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.749 
if we have the the the open E it's
starting<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.660> here<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.860> relatively<00:01:21.610> easy

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
starting in here so it's relatively easy

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.370 
starting in here so it's relatively easy
to<00:01:21.970> see<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.450> third<00:01:22.750> fret<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.960> one<00:01:26.170> here

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
to see the third fret is this one here

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.790 
to see the third fret is this one here
which<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.979> 15th<00:01:27.940> fret<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.810> just<00:01:29.050> mention

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
which is the 15th fret and just mention

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.190 
which is the 15th fret and just mention
it<00:01:30.100> from<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.490> which<00:01:31.270> one's<00:01:31.539> right<00:01:31.840> here<00:01:31.869> is

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
it from this which one's right here is

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.130 
it from this which one's right here is
like<00:01:32.789> they're<00:01:33.789> all<00:01:33.940> good<00:01:34.119> things<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.050> all

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
like they're all good things so it all

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.440 
like they're all good things so it all
starts<00:01:35.590> all<00:01:35.680> over<00:01:35.740> again<00:01:35.890> when<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:36.940> have<00:01:37.180> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
starts all over again when you have the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.080 
starts all over again when you have the
G<00:01:37.690> here<00:01:37.990> you're<00:01:38.170> also<00:01:38.289> Hettich<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.850> just

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
G here you're also Hettich so just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.480 
G here you're also Hettich so just
duplicating<00:01:40.689> this<00:01:40.840> pattern

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
duplicating this pattern

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180

so<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.439> is<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.980> good<00:02:47.159> to<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.239> lung

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
so this is really good to get the lung

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.979 
so this is really good to get the lung
landmark<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.829> you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.129> compile<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.720> major

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
landmark so you can compile the major

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.899 
landmark so you can compile the major

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
scale and the major maintenance right

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.350 
scale and the major maintenance right
arpeggios<00:02:57.680> mm-hmm<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.909> have<00:03:00.209> two

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
arpeggios mm-hmm so you have two

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:13.460 
arpeggios mm-hmm so you have two
landmarks<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.170> routier<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.989> it's<00:03:13.230> all

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
landmarks of the routier so it's all

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.559 
landmarks of the routier so it's all
about<00:03:13.970> playing<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.799> not<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:20.280> roof<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
about playing it's not on the roof so I

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.479 
about playing it's not on the roof so I
don't<00:03:21.870> want<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.079> do<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> same<00:03:24.980> with<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.190> the
