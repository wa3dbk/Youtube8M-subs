00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:08.460
 and it's fast 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.850
 this century of 90 100 kilos we took 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.850
 your 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.780
 or rather in essence if it was worth before 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.780
 late 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.510
 but I have a treaty that is already getting cold 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.820
 we feel 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.260
 well of a ton more or less like 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.540
 about 15 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.910
 if I do this evaluation in a century 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.950
 in this field and it took me half an hour to 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.240
 one hour 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.240
 a place this entrance 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.140
 for others with water to pass water 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 little bit more 20 liters 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.940
 city ​​but I'm going to do an extreme is 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.050
 will be working on them 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:34.580
 then are the people 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.580
 where are those details 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.220
 the same 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.530
 if he hits the trolley he will take it out 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.540
 where do you say 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.540
 why 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.320
 this position 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 yes 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.190
 first, but even though it 's the 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.080
 face and on top of him 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.080
 of the cement is while heating 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.769
 the ground floor 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.519
 plus 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.239
 but the way of resources 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.370
 the height I'm going to occupy will depend on the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.370
 height of the user's container 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.150
 40 centimeters military region and more to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.730
 this height 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.730
 If they are old they can last so long 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.820
 most minimal 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.630
 and once made by 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 Hello 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.860
 guard 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.980
 transport alone 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
 i 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.739
 morning 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.120
 problems 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.110
 no entry less strong 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.180
 it is important always with 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.129
 I do not know where the best place is 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.569
 is happening is quickly 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.200
 when one keeps a grain a seed 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.200
 hermetic 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.190
 it really kills concentrations up 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.190
 15% 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.570
 a forest 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.480
 thirst is good insects dies up the 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.480
 fifteen% 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.180
 this is like a bottle of 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.180
 glass if we leave it in the sun will sweat 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:53.869
 must be a Protestant 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:53.869
 for the purpose of increasing 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.620
 lifespan normally from 10 to 15 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.240
 years 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.840
 I feel that normally happens to 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.020
 onions 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.780
 with a bad initial management concludes 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.900
 of what occasions we put it with grains 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.030
 we want it days 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.560
 and as I say 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.190
 even in places 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.190
 in a way 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.440
 accommodating the seeds 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.440
 between more and so that there is less 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.410
 cleaning once they are cleaned or 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.410
 simply 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:50.000
 do not put anything on 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.120
 and to keep it 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.270
 and that is achieved 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.460
 is hurting with an agricultural implement 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.229
 with the same can 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.639
 the same calibers we can put a couple 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.069
 who is 2 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.669
 if not very large drilling 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.669
 the crazies 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.750
 because he has this case he is 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.750
 for your stores 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.570
 while years 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.530
 it is very important that normally this 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.530
 site 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.390
 in a well bought sky 100 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.670
 manufacturers 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.670
 well they sell it with metal seconds 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.430
 but we have adequate 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.420
 it would respond good as any 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.370
 he comes with his saints 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.840
 for my god 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.880
 then you have with your key that is not 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.110
 more are and I know it 's a tactic 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.810
 Y 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.810
 is a die there is a cube that is square 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:11.689
 missing 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.500
 for 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.139
 the threads that normally they 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.090
 I recommend they are going to leave 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.090
 make the effort to buy them 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.470
 does not come 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.400
 a package 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.260
 to synthesize the public
