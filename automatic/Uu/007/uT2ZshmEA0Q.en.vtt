00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
links where they do become heavy at the

links where they do become heavy at the
equation<00:05:49.590> but<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.490> can<00:05:50.700> rest<00:05:50.880> your<00:05:51.060> par<00:05:51.300> with

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
equation but you can rest your par with

equation but you can rest your par with
the<00:05:51.570> back<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.810> your<00:05:51.870> pole<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.320> there<00:05:52.620> instead

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
the back of your pole in there instead

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.710 
the back of your pole in there instead
of<00:05:53.130> putting<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.550> into<00:05:53.880> your<00:05:54.090> crotch<00:05:54.420> and<00:05:54.660> it

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
of putting it into your crotch and it

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.690 
of putting it into your crotch and it
just<00:05:54.900> takes<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.440> stress<00:05:55.830> out<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:56.220> that<00:05:56.370> holds

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
just takes the stress out and that holds

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.060 
just takes the stress out and that holds
the<00:05:56.790> pole<00:05:57.000> in<00:05:57.690> there<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.590> that's<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.860> nice

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
the pole in there and that's a nice

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.370 
the pole in there and that's a nice
molded<00:05:59.610> piece<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.390> if<00:06:00.510> you<00:06:00.630> don't<00:06:00.870> use<00:06:01.170> the

the market and the main point on the box

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.280 
the market and the main point on the box
is<00:06:33.840> it<00:06:34.200> is<00:06:34.470> so<00:06:34.680> compact<00:06:35.130> when<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.610> folding

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
is it is so compact when the folding

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.110 
is it is so compact when the folding
footplate<00:06:37.290> slots<00:06:37.560> in<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.740> position<00:06:38.220> well<00:06:39.030> now

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
footplate slots in the position well now

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.860 
footplate slots in the position well now
it's<00:06:39.270> a<00:06:39.360> modular<00:06:39.800> system<00:06:41.390> you<00:06:42.390> actually<00:06:42.420> feel

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
it's a modular system you actually feel

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.450 
it's a modular system you actually feel
iminium<00:06:43.230> it<00:06:43.380> really<00:06:43.650> is<00:06:43.710> smaller<00:06:44.010> compact

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
iminium it really is smaller compact

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.160 
iminium it really is smaller compact
especially<00:06:45.030> if<00:06:45.090> you're<00:06:45.210> traveling<00:06:45.390> those
