00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 tutorials of their 36's and again not 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.930
 I wanted to make this map because it came out in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.410
 the first one and I did not want to repeat what 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410
 more ask 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.829
 from batman 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:45.559
 a thick as it would be to place you against 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 this little column 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.620
 and we will notice that there is a jota jota 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 two 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.170
 and they are running 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 trigger 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.190
 and now upside down 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.470
 to one thing that you should not explain in 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.680
 the previous ones is that once you 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.590
 you have to keep the click pressed we are going to 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.930
 wait to pull a win and wait 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.610
 more or less I wish like calculating when 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.610
 it's going to happen I know I do not stop 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.939
 to maintain 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.670
 it's not that they give you courses and if it's 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.429
 necessary for any not like that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.440
 shows the animation not to say 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.440
 where does one go to see 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.319
 fraser that always because you can see every 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.730
 patent leather 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.610
 then we keep waiting to be 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.840
 goes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 subsequently always in the same place 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.530
 and in now long so we're going to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.530
 put together 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.650
 and good 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.930
 I'm going to put a p 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:02.200
 and the idea would be to point to a 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.200
 quarter 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.140
 from the minus point 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.080
 short 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.620
 in 1 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.740
 of the dot a little below is not a 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.750
 blood if you have the amount aside that what 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.320
 practices and that are national already you go 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.820
 to agree on guides to touch the point 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.540
 as always there are in all designs 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.510
 same I wanted to feel that one of the things 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.900
 who are going to notice that sometimes this mirror 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.780
 attack 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.940
 in the place and this point here 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.450
 as now they will be seeing a photo 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.550
 of the changes 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.819
 and the place would be the same as our 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.640
 fruit or think about the previous psuv 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.140
 to rice and aim almost anywhere 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.780
 does not mean it's at that point 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.150
 You can exactly stay a little longer 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.190
 the left and for example this is a 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.720
 little more to the left and it does not hit 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.620
 Take out more here 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.970
 but make it a suit here pakistan and 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:17.780
 ccoo and came to die fast and also 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.380
 it might happen to things but the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.120
 changes structures entered sometimes you 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.820
 find anything with the nucleus 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.820
 to exceed with the rusted plates 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.160
 well subject to any doubt or 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.110
 suggestion you have regarding the south 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.800
 based on a message to fire or here in 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.800
 youtube channel 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.480
