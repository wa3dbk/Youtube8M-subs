that<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.750> year<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> LSO<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.009> three

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
it's interesting as you say that the two

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.580

concertos<00:04:30.330> written<00:04:30.630> such<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> long<00:04:31.350> way<00:04:31.470> apart

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
concertos written such a long way apart

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.710 
concertos written such a long way apart
from<00:04:31.950> each<00:04:32.100> other<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.300> can<00:04:33.450> hear<00:04:33.600> it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
from each other and if you can hear it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.510 
from each other and if you can hear it
in<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> music<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:34.320> mean<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.890> first<00:04:35.280> concerto

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
in the music I mean the first concerto

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.750 
in the music I mean the first concerto
is<00:04:36.000> like<00:04:36.180> Don<00:04:36.840> Juan<00:04:36.870> mm-hmm<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:38.160> opposed<00:04:38.580> to

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
is like Don Juan mm-hmm as opposed to

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.210 
is like Don Juan mm-hmm as opposed to
the<00:04:38.880> second<00:04:39.210> concerto<00:04:39.360> which<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:40.080> much<00:04:40.620> closer

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
the second concerto which is much closer

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.810 
the second concerto which is much closer
to<00:04:41.460> say<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:42.750> last<00:04:42.930> song<00:04:43.140> yeah<00:04:43.410> in<00:04:44.280> character

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
to say for last song yeah in character

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.020 
to say for last song yeah in character
much<00:04:45.720> more<00:04:46.050> terminal<00:04:46.710> tomato<00:04:47.700> loss

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
much more terminal tomato loss

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.820 
much more terminal tomato loss
melancholy<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.990> all<00:04:49.230> those<00:04:49.380> words<00:04:49.590> yeah

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
melancholy it all those words yeah

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.670 
melancholy it all those words yeah
absolutely

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
absolutely

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.909 
absolutely
interestingly<00:04:53.720> it's<00:04:54.720> much<00:04:55.110> harder<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.620> play

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
interestingly it's much harder to play

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.880 
interestingly it's much harder to play
than<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.280> first<00:04:56.520> concerto<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.840> now<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.380> say

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
than the first concerto and now I say

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.140 
than the first concerto and now I say
interest<00:04:59.160> me<00:04:59.250> because<00:04:59.340> one<00:04:59.850> would<00:05:00.030> have

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
interest me because one would have

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.580 
interest me because one would have
thought<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.600> way<00:05:00.720> he<00:05:00.810> started<00:05:01.110> off<00:05:01.380> he<00:05:01.530> was

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
thought the way he started off he was

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.870 
thought the way he started off he was
going<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.800> be<00:05:01.860> really<00:05:02.040> ambitious<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.550> try<00:05:02.760> and

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
going to be really ambitious and try and

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.870 
going to be really ambitious and try and
show<00:05:03.780> what<00:05:03.900> he<00:05:03.960> could<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.520> but<00:05:05.520> actually<00:05:05.820> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
show what he could do but actually the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.060 
show what he could do but actually the
opposite<00:05:06.180> with<00:05:06.300> stress<00:05:06.510> as<00:05:07.140> he<00:05:07.380> got<00:05:07.650> further

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
opposite with stress as he got further

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.680 
opposite with stress as he got further
and<00:05:08.310> further<00:05:08.400> into<00:05:08.880> his<00:05:09.030> life<00:05:09.240> in<00:05:09.390> his<00:05:09.480> career

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
and further into his life in his career

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.180

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
he started writing things which are

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.280 
he started writing things which are
really<00:05:11.580> pushing<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:12.000> boundaries<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.990> the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
really pushing the boundaries of the
