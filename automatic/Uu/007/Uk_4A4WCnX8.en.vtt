get<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:45.650> going<00:01:46.130> there's<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.090> much<00:01:47.150> butter<00:01:47.479> I

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
get this going there's so much butter I

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.789 
get this going there's so much butter I
I<00:01:47.720> don't<00:01:48.290> know<00:01:48.380> if<00:01:48.439> they're<00:01:48.560> going<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.740> be

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
I don't know if they're going to be

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.219 
I don't know if they're going to be
saying<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.250> once<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.850> squid<00:01:50.780> comes<00:01:50.990> and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229

strain boost I don't know if they're

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.289 
strain boost I don't know if they're
going<00:03:58.729> to<00:03:58.819> be<00:03:58.909> able<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.209> do<00:03:59.359> it<00:04:01.120> some<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.239> them

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
going to be able to do it some of them

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.349 
going to be able to do it some of them
are<00:04:02.419> retreating<00:04:02.840> Wow<00:04:03.250> 100<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.340> them<00:04:04.549> some<00:04:05.329> of

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
are retreating Wow 100 of them some of

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.679 
are retreating Wow 100 of them some of
them<00:04:05.479> are<00:04:05.720> like<00:04:05.840> hurrying<00:04:06.169> away<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:07.569> 100<00:04:08.569> of

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
them are like hurrying away and 100 of

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.619 
them are like hurrying away and 100 of
them<00:04:08.870> did<00:04:09.349> basically<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.220> same<00:04:10.459> as<00:04:10.519> what<00:04:11.239> 50<00:04:11.599> I

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
them did basically the same as what 50 I

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.390 
them did basically the same as what 50 I
think<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.139> glass<00:04:12.259> arena<00:04:12.739> kind<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.159> helped

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
think the glass arena kind of helped

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.110 
think the glass arena kind of helped
them<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.669> last<00:04:13.849> time<00:04:14.199> but<00:04:15.310> this<00:04:16.310> time<00:04:16.609> I<00:04:16.669> don't

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
them the last time but this time I don't

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.029 
them the last time but this time I don't
think<00:04:17.389> they<00:04:17.539> were<00:04:17.599> able<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.289> prevail<00:04:18.799> in

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
think they were able to prevail in

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.560 
think they were able to prevail in
future<00:04:19.459> times<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:19.969> guess<00:04:20.120> I'll<00:04:20.239> just<00:04:20.269> have<00:04:20.479> to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
future times I guess I'll just have to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.990 
future times I guess I'll just have to
use<00:04:21.469> a<00:04:21.759> glass<00:04:22.759> dome<00:04:23.210> again<00:04:24.219> but<00:04:25.219> they<00:04:25.639> got<00:04:25.820> them

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
use a glass dome again but they got them

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.390 
use a glass dome again but they got them
like<00:04:26.150> halfway<00:04:26.620> there's<00:04:27.620> only<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.889> few<00:04:28.099> skies

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
like halfway there's only a few skies

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.370 
like halfway there's only a few skies
left<00:04:28.789> who's<00:04:29.060> going<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.330> win<00:04:29.449> this<00:04:29.659> well<00:04:30.199> I<00:04:30.229> mean

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
left who's going to win this well I mean

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.260 
left who's going to win this well I mean
it's<00:04:30.530> kind<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.860> obvious<00:04:31.009> but<00:04:31.490> we<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.120> some

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
it's kind of obvious but we have some

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.620 
it's kind of obvious but we have some
skies<00:04:32.539> over<00:04:32.930> here<00:04:33.400> let's<00:04:34.400> break<00:04:34.759> this<00:04:35.000> no<00:04:35.479> more
