00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.030
 the floating balls are apparently 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.520
 simple games that children can use 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.420
 or all kinds of people to have fun 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.060
 but these gigantic balls where 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.449
 introduce people can get 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.000
 to be mortal take this into account if 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.070
 you have a child or if you ever want 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.590
 get inside these balls 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 just to have fun because what 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.559
 what I am going to say is true 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 these balls to be hermetically 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.140
 closed so that water does not enter either 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.539
 oxygen enters and it is expected that the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.539
 ability of these balls is so 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.299
 only about 10 minutes of oxygen if a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.299
 person spends more than 10 minutes within 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.420
 this ball can automatically arrive 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.789
 to suffocate and in some cases die if 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 no attention is paid but no 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.119
 only this is not only the subject 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 excess power die dioxide 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 carbon but the repeated falling 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.850
 times because when one is in a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.270
 ball of this type is very unstable and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.330
 You can not stop falling, too 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.510
 can cause important injuries 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 I have two American cases here 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.610
 that the truth is that they give enough 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.400
 think for example a girl of five 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.110
 years of usa that fainted within 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.690
 a ball for a short period of time 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 lack of oxygen and a small child who 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.720
 he fractured his arm when he fell inside 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.720
 of a ball 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.190
 all kinds of things can happen what 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.490
 it is clear that this new invention does not 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.010
 it's something sure it 's fun but it has 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.040
 to be done in a pretty way 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.110
 cautious and never exceed five 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.290
 minutes that say that the capacity is of 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.790
 ten minutes and in some cases it is left 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.280
 children play within these 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.679
 balls up to half an hour with the risks 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.220
 of carbon dioxide poisoning 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.490
 that entails do not be carried away by 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.220
 the fashions do not let us take this 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.380
 kind of tourist attractions because 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.670
 the end of the day they can become 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.670
 harmful to health
