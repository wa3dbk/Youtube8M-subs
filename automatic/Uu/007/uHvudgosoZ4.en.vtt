 sheer rubber body plastic glass and 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.330
 The truth is rounded, it can be seen 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.420
 Well, it seems to be kind of like true glass 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.250
 the fact that she is a safir, then I am sapphire closely 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.280

 open to me it's just a watch like 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.490
 this is not a watch with a call function 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.590
 my, that is, not quite a dome 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.560

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.560
 link to the item will be under the video so 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.070
 cool display see well, as I understand it 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.950
 that he is not exactly the color you are here 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.940

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.860
 call stake let's gazebo blow from 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.250
 course with cool that is possible in principle 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.980
 when you connect the clock to the smartphone 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.040
 accordingly make calls like this 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.120

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.360
 It looks like the main screen of the clock, that is, I 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:34.199
 Now I will try to go to him my girls 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.500

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.270
 enough like yes oh so if she should 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:48.900
 be like this clip 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.560
 no yes of course something never 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.560
 enough 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.490
 Well, how can you put it on somewhere 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:06.140
 lying around 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:07.820
 No, of course of course of course I don’t 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.630
 did you great 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.850
 you smartly smartly but simply do not watch 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.770
 Of course it's cool, but that's really how it is 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.130
 there is well how did the state have to check 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.560
 before sending from as 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:27.680
 for example, I can wear them in any way I can not 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.510
 walk unfortunately without special 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.180
 fixtures when the clip should have been 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.310
 be able to have 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:46.790
 she could not have grown anywhere 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:50.330
 not here, here, too, there is not so 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.330
 interesting so generally not interesting to me 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:58.730
 guys this is no business to be honest this 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.150
 it is not a matter of display we have yes 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.580
 slightly inverted that is it 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.350
 It seems that not lps 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.030
 Well, I do not even know purely sin what to do 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:12.590
 and what to say as if yes that is not 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.990
 I want to spoil the reputation of the store but 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.760
 yet I don't know how such a thing is 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.690
 I will write 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.520
 the manager may have reached accounting feet to 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.930
 Unfortunately, this is not immediately immediately 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.620
 it turns out well, except that so I lean 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.260
 let's see how here you are 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.090
 watch looks on hands on mink hand 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.060
 principle looks pretty let's say 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.420
 well normally it sits properly 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.300
 the quality of materials that is not not coarse 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.940
 rubber, that is, such more or less 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.190
 let's say it feels ok 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.280
 so the principle can be used gums 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.560
 limb it would still latch something 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.010
 it would definitely be possible as well 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.850
 that so far no okay that is it 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.860
 We review this for you 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.730
 from the store now and then reference and of course 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:08.660
 will I put it under the video whether I will write lilu 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.970
 Well, just ask how you breathe where is 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.610
 clip that is tok tok tok to walk like 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.200
 I do not want to review and test the well and 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.210
 so on, that is, if you give me some cruelties 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.020
 Most likely there will be a review in an hour too 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:23.240
 on the channel, if not reached then I do n’t know 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.660
 in short it will be seen in general as 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.120
 is said 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.850
 Well, on this I will finish my video with 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.710
 such a small first acquaintance 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.070
 unpacking and there will generally be further 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.590
 it is seen 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.820
 link to the product page will be 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.620
 be under the video so here 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.580
 interested watch will be going 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.620
 look 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.620
 I’ll finish the video for now because 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.979
 Basically what I saw first told 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.090
 but so far everything is big 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:49.530
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.310
 why did you put this video if the video 

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.659
 liked it like to write your own 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:58.699
 comments ask your questions 

00:07:54.659 --> 00:08:01.590
 what do you think about this 

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:04.919
 That's interesting, too, to know your thoughts and 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:08.990
 how do you do these things with him?
