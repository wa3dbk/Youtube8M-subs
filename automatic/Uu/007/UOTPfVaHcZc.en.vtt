00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.320
 just as you are while all my 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.230
 wounds I forget the silence of my 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.900
 thoughts and it's music the language of 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.740
 My life left hurt all the letters

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.960
 Oblivion has detected out bitter 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 I will write a paragraph leaves me 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.800
 unhappy spencer reflection that 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.840
 discover every day that writing is not 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.850
 only rhyme were made with two words 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.280
 I discover it in drafts thousands of 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 mistakes does not say sodium does not 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.960

 time is to talk to the mirror that I am 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.190
 flesh and bone writing I confess to 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.230
 compass of what took the context to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.239

 express what I feel I tell you 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.739
 friends but I go through the lines that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 it's to calm sadness because it's far from me 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.700
 or I will not live to remind you that I am getting old

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.269
 notebooks 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.030

 taiwan these letters all my wounds the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.070

 torment up of my words and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.120
 I condemn each letter to pay for this world 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.860
 without group and fate I write between 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 verses between souls and delusions 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.030
