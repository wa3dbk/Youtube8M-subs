00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.640 

you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.010 

you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.060 

nasty<00:00:50.610> least<00:00:51.610> it's<00:00:51.960> sort<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.170> paste<00:00:53.470> like<00:00:53.800> and

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
nasty least it's sort of paste like and

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.300 
nasty least it's sort of paste like and
not<00:00:54.190> just<00:00:54.570> totally<00:00:55.570> crunchy<00:00:56.020> but<00:00:56.970> yeah<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:59.739> a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
not just totally crunchy but yeah it's a

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:10.930 
not just totally crunchy but yeah it's a
bit<00:01:00.550> overdue<00:01:01.120> for<00:01:01.360> getting<00:01:01.660> her<00:01:01.900> placed

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.490 

you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.230 

not<00:01:16.500> sure<00:01:16.800> how<00:01:17.100> well<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> camera<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:17.970> focus

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
not sure how well the camera will focus

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.440 
not sure how well the camera will focus
on<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:23.100> Core<00:01:23.490> 2<00:01:23.520> Duo<00:01:23.760> as

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on that but this is not a Core 2 Duo as

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.730 
on that but this is not a Core 2 Duo as
it<00:01:25.080> originally<00:01:25.710> claimed<00:01:26.160> on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.150> case<00:01:27.740> this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it originally claimed on the case this

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.420 
it originally claimed on the case this
is<00:01:28.980> in<00:01:29.010> fact<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.490> pentium<00:01:29.970> d<00:01:31.070> 3.2<00:01:32.070> gigahertz

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
is in fact a pentium d 3.2 gigahertz

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:45.290 
is in fact a pentium d 3.2 gigahertz
pentium<00:01:33.150> d<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.570> that's<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:37.050> odd

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.510 

okay<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.600> computer<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.409> all<00:01:47.590> back<00:01:47.800> together

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
okay the computer is all back together

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.760 
okay the computer is all back together
fresh<00:01:48.880> thermal<00:01:49.510> compound<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.290> heatsink

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
fresh thermal compound on the heatsink

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.310 
fresh thermal compound on the heatsink
that's<00:01:51.040> all<00:01:51.250> properly<00:01:51.760> clamped<00:01:52.210> down<00:01:52.240> got<00:01:53.080> it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
that's all properly clamped down got it

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.760 
that's all properly clamped down got it
in<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> fan<00:01:53.860> all<00:01:54.370> scrubbed<00:01:55.000> out<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.450> dust<00:01:55.780> and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
in the fan all scrubbed out of dust and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.590 
in the fan all scrubbed out of dust and
it<00:01:56.860> plugged<00:01:57.100> into<00:01:57.280> my<00:01:57.370> kilowatt<00:01:57.910> here<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.570> I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
it plugged into my kilowatt here so I

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.540 
it plugged into my kilowatt here so I
can<00:01:58.900> keep<00:01:59.290> track<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.619> how<00:01:59.770> much<00:01:59.979> power<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
can keep track of how much power the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.800 
can keep track of how much power the
unit's<00:02:00.820> consuming<00:02:01.650> have<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.330> stove

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
unit's consuming have it on the stove

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.140 
unit's consuming have it on the stove

and<00:04:51.449> in<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.479> touch<00:04:53.069> heatsink<00:04:54.069> is<00:04:54.310> quite<00:04:55.120> warm

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
and in a touch heatsink is quite warm

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360

but<00:04:56.560> there<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:59.139> airflow<00:04:59.349> through<00:04:59.620> it<00:05:00.129> is

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
but there is the airflow through it is

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.570 
but there is the airflow through it is
almost<00:05:01.090> non-existent

most of the fans airflow is simply

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.379 
most of the fans airflow is simply
bypassing<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.919> heatsink<00:05:06.340> entirely<00:05:06.669> just<00:05:07.240> as

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
bypassing the heatsink entirely just as

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.100 
bypassing the heatsink entirely just as
I<00:05:07.509> suspected<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.180> can<00:05:10.330> hear<00:05:10.599> the<00:05:10.900> fan

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
I suspected and so you can hear the fan

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.999 
I suspected and so you can hear the fan
that's<00:05:11.319> running<00:05:11.650> like<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.860> jet<00:05:12.130> engine<00:05:12.270> yet

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
that's running like a jet engine yet

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.070 
that's running like a jet engine yet
most<00:05:15.009> back<00:05:15.729> nearly<00:05:16.180> all<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.509> air<00:05:16.630> is<00:05:16.840> just

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
most back nearly all the air is just

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.020 
most back nearly all the air is just
flowing<00:05:17.650> right<00:05:18.220> around<00:05:18.460> it<00:05:18.960> they<00:05:19.960> think<00:05:20.020> is

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
flowing right around it they think is

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.600 
flowing right around it they think is
kind<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.150> warm<00:05:22.479> and<00:05:22.860> well<00:05:24.449> yeah<00:05:25.449> it's<00:05:25.979> it's<00:05:26.979> not

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
kind of warm and well yeah it's it's not

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.230 
kind of warm and well yeah it's it's not
too<00:05:27.880> happy<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:29.500> first<00:05:29.770> prototype<00:05:30.310> is<00:05:30.669> just

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
too happy the first prototype is just

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.689 
too happy the first prototype is just

sort<00:06:46.270> of<00:06:46.360> I<00:06:46.630> guess<00:06:47.110> restore<00:06:48.009> it<00:06:48.190> to<00:06:48.370> original
