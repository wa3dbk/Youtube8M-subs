00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
find an appropriate open spot we've

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.860 
find an appropriate open spot we've

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
pulled all the excess wire through from

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.440 
pulled all the excess wire through from
that<00:02:17.050> side<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.010> they're<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.000> wires<00:02:19.209> on

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
that side so they're all the wires on

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.880 
that side so they're all the wires on
the<00:02:19.480> engine<00:02:19.900> side<00:02:20.110> are<00:02:20.319> correct<00:02:20.650> lengths

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
the engine side are correct lengths

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.490 
the engine side are correct lengths
running<00:02:21.280> roughly<00:02:21.550> where<00:02:21.730> they<00:02:21.850> should<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
running roughly where they should you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.110 
running roughly where they should you
always<00:02:23.709> end<00:02:24.130> up<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.430> better<00:02:24.610> extra<00:02:24.970> if

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
always end up with a better extra if

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.240 
always end up with a better extra if
you're<00:02:25.270> gonna<00:02:25.390> run<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:25.840> way<00:02:26.130> where<00:02:27.130> is

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
you're gonna run it this way where is

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.680 
you're gonna run it this way where is
the<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.640> both<00:02:27.790> come<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> each<00:02:28.270> other<00:02:28.450> you're

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the the both come to each other you're

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.970 
the the both come to each other you're
then<00:02:28.810> going<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.050> connect<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:29.560> bunch<00:02:29.800> to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
then going to connect the one bunch to

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920 
then going to connect the one bunch to
the<00:02:30.069> other<00:02:30.160> bunch<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:31.120> tie<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.420> wrist<00:02:31.720> up<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
the other bunch and tie the wrist up and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.449 
the other bunch and tie the wrist up and
put<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.319> down<00:02:32.410> beyond<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.890> dish<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.370> you

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
put it down beyond the dish so if you

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.610 
put it down beyond the dish so if you
have<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.610> little<00:02:33.760> bit<00:02:33.970> extra<00:02:34.239> why<00:02:35.170> should<00:02:35.530> you

have a little bit extra why should you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.140 
have a little bit extra why should you

it drives a relay which you can use to

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.940 
it drives a relay which you can use to
cut<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.660> engine<00:03:19.930> when<00:03:20.079> they<00:03:20.200> when<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> EMS

just to tidy up the wiring you're going

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.170 
just to tidy up the wiring you're going
to<00:04:41.260> pick<00:04:41.440> one<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.060> picked<00:04:44.850> no.16<00:04:45.850> let<00:04:46.090> me

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
to pick one so I picked no.16 let me

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.879 
to pick one so I picked no.16 let me
just<00:04:46.330> put<00:04:46.510> away<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.930> bulk<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.440> wiring

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
just put away the bulk of the wiring

00:04:47.889 --> 00:05:06.540 
just put away the bulk of the wiring
guys

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.370 

and<00:05:07.550> now<00:05:07.700> they<00:05:08.500> ugt<00:05:09.500> probe<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.280> bit<00:05:10.520> long

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
and now they ugt probe is a bit long

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.450 
and now they ugt probe is a bit long
contrary<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.470> be<00:05:12.560> cut<00:05:12.770> so<00:05:12.800> we're<00:05:13.160> just<00:05:13.190> going

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
contrary to be cut so we're just going

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.390 
contrary to be cut so we're just going
to<00:05:13.490> fold<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:13.970> up<00:05:14.680> take<00:05:15.680> up<00:05:15.860> all<00:05:16.040> our<00:05:16.160> extra
