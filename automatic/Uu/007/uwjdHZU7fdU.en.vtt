was on a busy main road and I failed a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.230 
was on a busy main road and I failed a
hill<00:02:43.920> start<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.400> couple<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.760> times<00:02:44.970> where<00:02:45.210> I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
hill start a couple of times where I

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.930 
hill start a couple of times where I
live<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.630> super<00:02:46.050> hilly<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.310> now<00:02:47.550> I'm<00:02:47.760> pretty

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
live it's super hilly but now I'm pretty

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.790 
live it's super hilly but now I'm pretty
much<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.390> while<00:02:48.660> ago<00:02:48.930> now<00:02:48.960> i'm<00:02:49.260> pretty<00:02:49.470> much<00:02:49.500> fun

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
much a while ago now i'm pretty much fun

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.860 
much a while ago now i'm pretty much fun
with<00:02:50.010> hill<00:02:50.250> starts<00:02:50.670> just<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.420> know<00:02:51.540> get<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
with hill starts just you know get the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870 
with hill starts just you know get the
clutch<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.500> accelerator<00:02:53.100> balance<00:02:53.670> take

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
clutch and the accelerator balance take

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.910 
clutch and the accelerator balance take
off<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.210> hand<00:02:54.450> brake<00:02:54.720> roll<00:02:55.050> forward<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.710> bit

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
off the hand brake roll forward a bit

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.820 
off the hand brake roll forward a bit
then<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.820> head<00:02:57.150> off<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.600> mean<00:02:58.350> there<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.650> so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
then just head off I mean there is so

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.860 
then just head off I mean there is so
much<00:02:59.010> coordination<00:02:59.400> to<00:03:00.300> deal<00:03:00.450> with<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
much coordination to deal with it but I

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.180 
much coordination to deal with it but I
guess<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.320> like<00:03:01.590> learning<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.980> walk

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
guess it's just like learning to walk

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.180 
guess it's just like learning to walk
eventually<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.000> will<00:03:03.420> become<00:03:03.830> natural<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.040> me

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
eventually it will become natural to me

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.400 
eventually it will become natural to me
and<00:03:05.400> probably<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.150> biggest<00:03:06.360> mess<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:06.990> i<00:03:07.140> did

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
and probably the biggest mess up i did

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.380 
and probably the biggest mess up i did
this<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.190> when<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.820> hear<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.150> you're<00:03:09.330> gonna
