00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.920
 the demand 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.660
 have to row to row to sunset eight 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.740
 days was the league 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.990
 today they are at a game of new account 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.119
 in the place and they found the equipment or 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.510
 maybe worse 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.900
 of active results can dawn the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.880
 next week 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.829
 the subject is not the strong subject of you take 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.450
 today the plan to decline but but more 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.460
 beyond their is that they have not achieved 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.329
 find the time after bad not no 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.850
 You can be regular even when bad but 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:53.390
 this guy found me a regularity 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.190
 same good bad regular that does not have 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.100
 arguments to go to win it populates as 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.820
 visitor for example on Friday 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 the blame 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.869
 if we compare what he has done that 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.190
 inherited throughout the tournament a 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.619
 team that chivas could not 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.720
 win against what the people have done 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.520
 it seems to me that today it has much less 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.830
 arguments with which to beat a town 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 that with what he could for example against 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.860
 blue cross was because fernando had him 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.860
 gave away the party 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.110
 he stopped with the best 20 minutes 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.789
 who played do the whole tournament in the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 blue stadium at the end match of the 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.569
 reality of chivas but that is the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.429
 chepo problem not found 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.179
 how to make the team keep 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.920
 At least 60 minutes of good football 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.830
 he can not find it in a game that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.720
 I also see it is what is going to you 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.640
 to say is not that poor time is being 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.350
 breaking the head the guy accepted a 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:03.829
 decision that is to throw the team back 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:06.189
 with higher scale the first time and 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.590
 then in the second it is no longer the same 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:13.269
 the team then when it's not going 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.269
 will not be able to generate those that have 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.540
 staff for example that happened to you level 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.799
 national team if it's the type 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.780
 There came a time when I did not know how 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.269
 attack how to generate goals and that happened to him 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.950
 invoice in the Aztec when here tied 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.600
 to zeros against jamaica when there came 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.130
 the debacle completely of josé manuel 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.959
 of the tower but you know that with chivas 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 they do the same thing as the lord does not know 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.970
 attack 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.799
 here the theme this mind Nestor and the chepo 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.600
 of the tower is very clear is analyzing 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.400
 the campus and where the men of 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.280
 experience the highest quality men 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.530
 are ahead would you think that what 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.870
 better does it equal to attack the ior and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 ring 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.810
 [Laughs] 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.810
 [Music] 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.880
 [Laughs] 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.109
 do not 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.700
 so cold truth is that no 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.370
 [Laughs] 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.370
 [Applause] 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:57.350
 I still think that to believe in love he 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.120
 it's already on paper it looks like it's 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.880
 feasible so it's model that your 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.530
 old age already left in the hands of puebla 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.530
 for now 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 what argument can you say that is going 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.260
 to win at morals and morelia being the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.229
 worse team a cartoon strong team 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.600
 won the game last season 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.600
 last season to today today today 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.110
 the results are very negative 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.110
 Morelia Morelia does little 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:43.900
 has been 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.510
 the factor 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.740
 with two substitutes that he will send because 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.590
 the list as calcite go the substitutes 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.760
 it's over by being with you see everything 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.370
 lies in the weekend game 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.630
 you do not have an official match that is 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.580
 much more important than a 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.530
 training for what the chepo has 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.380
 and he has to prove who is going to accompany 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.390
 forward to ferro 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:23.930
 clear he got injured better but hey ok 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:40.240
 but it would generate the cube 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:42.620
 do not have to prove that next Monday 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.180
 I would be offering apologies but all 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.180
 depends on this case 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.910
 that today is in your hands or not 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.830
 as two weeks ago no matter how much you add and 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.830
 sum of g now from above 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.190
 and he beat tigers 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:20.870
 it is a place the typical common place of 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.789
 journalism that's why the new generation 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.789
 has arrived because they do not analyze to see 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.590
 but this is how it happened, you have to see 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.260
 the performance 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:40.420
 I did see him defending the shots 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:43.420
 and second has a speed with a lot 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.420
 weather 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.460
 all the ground 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.190
 that the podóloga makes their masahito and 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.680
 kiss on the big toe is not a thing 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.000
 natural I yesterday came from a flight of three 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.270
 hours and a half and the car was 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.490
 dying of sleep and this house did not yield 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.530
 a soccer player is also human and if 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.770
 it's a 12 hour 14 hour flight because 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:23.000
 you end some brutal connections arrive 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.650
 tired forgive me but it's natural is 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.050
 that poor but had break the 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.150
 recovering drunken heels on a Saturday 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.900
 and Sunday night you're here crossing 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.900
 with the effect 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:49.350
 I live, I'm perfect, the leadership 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.350
 that's why the truth
