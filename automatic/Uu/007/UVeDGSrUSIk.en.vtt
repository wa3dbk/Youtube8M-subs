cars from one of the same handful of
suppliers<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:10.759> not<00:02:10.880> different<00:02:11.150> at<00:02:11.360> that

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.900

level<00:02:11.900> but<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.470> car<00:02:12.740> maker<00:02:12.980> customizes<00:02:13.790> how

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
level but the car maker customizes how

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.080

all<00:02:17.090> right<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.330> three<00:02:17.510> things<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.870> look<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.230> in

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
all right so three things to look for in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.650 
all right so three things to look for in
that<00:02:18.350> respect<00:02:18.830> how<00:02:19.670> visible<00:02:20.090> are<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.450> lights

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660
