 we are in it now is actually it 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.520

 that silo I saw so were here and there 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.630
 a cake that would do what I do well 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.180
 even if you already notice the whole event 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.700
 that the audience is very different 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.860
 there at a regular performance because 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.600
 You also know that they have a specific purpose 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.220
 end they are here there is there is money 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.460
 Collected there is with its all to one 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.540
 purpose worked and I believe if I have the 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.830
 posts may believe it all 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.600
 very well succeeded is that it is a whole 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.980
 successful evening was this 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.440
 yes, you also notice that in the energy 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.600
 that come loose in public I also found the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.670
 place and you have to do a lot 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.380
 occur at the sand and at the sand 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.180
 performance 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.950
 well that is just performance that i do 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.390
 I know it is August 23rd 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.780

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.400
 we go past the summer again 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.840

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.140
 the festival 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.910
 I think anyway I have one 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.380
 just understood that we arrived and that is 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.840
 not advance me that for a 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.820
 very very good cause is that you didn't know 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.110
 no we knew that soon in the agenda 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.100
 of course we see something it is already there 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.470
 in the neighborhood just look where to go 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.880
 so we arrived here in what 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.950
 good information about this building in and 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.650
 say about the terrible condition 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.360
 but which gives such a performance anyway 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.250
 yes there is a huge added value especially 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.020
 or humans animals 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.300
 work on this in that series of peace 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.980
 light lisette so you are just one 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.410
 fantastic that they organize it 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.790
 yes and I, and I think everyone 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.990
 it still doesn't cooperate here so we 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.070
 have done it with great pleasure 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.170
 with a lot of respect for the 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.780
 volunteers who yes again is in it 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.190
 sit I think we think open anyway 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.930
 air performances very nice 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.280
 in the summer to natural but weather 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.810
 hope we have already made a few mega 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.790
 it has not yet finished 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.900
 so maybe when we get a them later 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.310
 get in the in the in the flowing 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.590
 rain that we are very different about that 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.650
 think but so far we find open 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.740
 air performances very nice and yes indeed 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.479
 it this 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.979
 this initiative is beautiful in this building 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.990
 crazy 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.560
 okay and that disease where it is about 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.560
 Huntington's disease 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.770
 I didn't know anything about that and that is 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.789
 very serious 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.380
 yes yes people you know yes I have yes I who 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:01.560
 people walking around here and that is yes 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.930
 and I understand that those symptoms pass 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.880
 Start when you are 30 35 years old 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.560
 just read and it does so for 18 years 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.569
 and then they die 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.150
 equally beautiful around equally very blunt 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.949
 to say yes yes that and coarse yes no but 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:22.830
 that is that I have read so literally 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:24.720
 I think this is what yes and this one 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.690
 these monkeys 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.159
 music is fun to do anyway 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.389
 the people were fantastic and tonight 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.180
 if that is for a good cause 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.720
 then such a very happy with it I want you 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.560
 to thank 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.560
 thanks yes yes yes and see you next time 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.270
