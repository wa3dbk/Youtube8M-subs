00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.750
 the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.879
 hello how are you assholes who like 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.010
 the super more as you already know in 2014 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.639
 we will launch the new super mas for three 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.830
 times 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.599
 but not without telling them a little about 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.439
 what will be the game here is the 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.439
 3ds version 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.520
 as you can see we put more colors 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.200
 with rainbow of girls movie this 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.710
 we do it so they get confused and see 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.930
 better graphics in the game 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.059
 here we have also the immortal of 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.309
 mario that as you can see is dancing 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.320
 like asshole that's because we decided 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.809
 put ants on the pants too 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.760
 we have the bushehr pejelagarto in 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.890
 this version will no longer appear the chorus 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.879
 given that we also touch it so that it 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 move more smoothies 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.680
 so I left you as an omelette but as I know 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.150
 that many are not interested in this better 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.460
 let's go to the wii version 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.040
 how can you see the windows graphics 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.750
 they look totally in hd beating with 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.300
 you grow to the original wii version 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.820
 giving a complete immersion in the game 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.920
 so that it looks like fucking mother 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.110
 but I do not know why I keep talking about 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.330
 graphs I know that what they like most are 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.030
 the new characters yes yes it is 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.250
 the hour arrived that many expected but 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.020
 before I get to that I want to tell you 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.460
 who has seen many videos between october 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.650
 of the characters they want in the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.130
 new is more so here they have the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.130
 First 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 or 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.469
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha see I'm honest 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.719
 because of every 25 videos on YouTube from 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.880
 top 10 characters that they wanted to see in 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.189
 the new one is more the dance yesterday they appeared 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.350
 one in the 10th position so I thought that if 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.569
 appeared so low they actually wanted 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.640
 cheat me to put it so here what 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.640
 have now with the next character 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.420
 that's how I put the first mega man and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.490
 that unlike the dance yesterday there what 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.950
 I found in almost all the videos and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.140
 obviously I want to please my fans and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.210
 for camps with this conference I will tell you 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.220

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.170
