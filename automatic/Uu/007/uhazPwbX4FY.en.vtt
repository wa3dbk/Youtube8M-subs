00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 

I<00:00:48.300> don't<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.050> there's<00:00:49.290> really<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> set<00:00:49.950> age

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I don't know if there's really a set age

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
I don't know if there's really a set age
where<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.110> absolutely<00:00:52.110> should<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.649> should

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
where you absolutely should or should

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.459 
where you absolutely should or should
not<00:00:52.890> let<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.699> child<00:00:54.360> wear<00:00:54.690> makeup<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.230> think

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
not let your child wear makeup I think

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.920 
not let your child wear makeup I think
it<00:00:55.530> depends<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.040> lot<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> kid<00:00:56.730> should<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it depends a lot on the kid should not I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
it depends a lot on the kid should not I
think<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.410> important<00:00:59.190> though<00:00:59.280> there

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
think is really important though there

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
think is really important though there
is<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> not<00:01:00.000> ten<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.870> under<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.290> just<00:01:01.620> really

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is a not ten and under I just really

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
is a not ten and under I just really
don't<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:03.149> should<00:01:03.180> do

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
don't think that they should do

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
don't think that they should do
foundation<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.259> lip<00:01:04.440> liner<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.280> just

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
foundation and lip liner and I just

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.210 
foundation and lip liner and I just
don't<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.050> do<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:08.070> go

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
don't think they need to do that to go

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
don't think they need to do that to go
to<00:01:08.280> school<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.000> don't<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.810> there

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
to school so they don't be so there

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
to school so they don't be so there
should<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.200> rules<00:01:10.530> about<00:01:10.800> maybe<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.550> of

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
should be rules about maybe the kind of

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
should be rules about maybe the kind of
makeup<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.420> wear<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:13.110> PlayStation
