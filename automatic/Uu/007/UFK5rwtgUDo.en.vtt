comes to a lot of small bumps like that

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.390 
comes to a lot of small bumps like that
otherwise<00:03:07.320> they're<00:03:07.560> just<00:03:07.590> got<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.100> kind<00:03:08.280> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
otherwise they're just got to kind of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.740 
otherwise they're just got to kind of
slow<00:03:09.120> down<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:10.290> fast<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.710> new<00:03:13.860> record

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.690 

a<00:03:18.750> little<00:03:19.590> different<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.580> actually

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
a little different that you actually

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.210 
a little different that you actually
have<00:03:21.000> opponents<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.810> one

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.610 

all<00:03:29.820> right<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.600> said<00:03:30.840> doesn't<00:03:31.050> matter<00:03:31.350> how

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
all right like I said doesn't matter how

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.160 
all right like I said doesn't matter how
many<00:03:31.680> opponents<00:03:32.340> are<00:03:32.460> in<00:03:32.550> front<00:03:32.880> or<00:03:33.120> bottom<00:03:33.540> in

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
many opponents are in front or bottom in

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.790 
many opponents are in front or bottom in
front<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.650> or<00:03:34.860> behind<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:36.050> your<00:03:37.050> position<00:03:37.260> is

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
front of or behind you your position is

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.840 
front of or behind you your position is
still<00:03:37.830> entirely<00:03:38.550> based<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.210> time<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:41.670> can

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
still entirely based on time you can

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.500 
still entirely based on time you can
basically<00:03:42.360> clip<00:03:42.900> off<00:03:43.080> your<00:03:43.290> opponents<00:03:43.890> by

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
basically clip off your opponents by

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.150

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.960 

now

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.190 

running<00:03:57.970> into<00:03:58.270> an<00:03:58.540> opponent<00:03:59.640> will<00:04:01.050> make<00:04:02.050> you
