00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.979 
lateral line like most of their fish the
pin<00:02:26.709> bones<00:02:27.010> very<00:02:27.700> few<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.150> them<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.870> can

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
pin bones very few of them so you can

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.650 
pin bones very few of them so you can
just<00:02:29.140> cut<00:02:29.380> those<00:02:29.590> ones<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:30.540> nicely<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:32.739> that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
just cut those ones up nicely like that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090 
just cut those ones up nicely like that
and<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:36.489> can<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.880> take<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.300> flesh<00:02:38.100> cut

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
and then you can just take the flesh cut

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.930 
and then you can just take the flesh cut
the<00:02:39.280> little<00:02:39.489> entrails<00:02:40.000> off<00:02:40.860> look<00:02:41.860> cool<00:02:42.069> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the little entrails off look cool and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.699 
the little entrails off look cool and
then<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.330> take<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.600> fillet<00:02:44.080> off<00:02:44.319> the

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
then you just take the fillet off the

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.979 
then you just take the fillet off the
skin<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:45.580> make<00:02:46.150> sure<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.360> rock<00:02:46.600> fish<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:46.959> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
skin now make sure a rock fish are a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.070 
skin now make sure a rock fish are a
little<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:47.319> more<00:02:47.880> tender<00:02:48.880> skin<00:02:49.600> than<00:02:50.050> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
little bit more tender skin than the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.199 
little bit more tender skin than the
link<00:02:50.920> cut<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.459> easier<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> cut<00:02:51.970> through

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
link cut so it's easier to cut through

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.270 
link cut so it's easier to cut through
and<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.510> mess<00:02:52.660> up<00:02:52.780> your<00:02:52.840> village<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.530> be

gentle don't angle it like too much down

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.949 
gentle don't angle it like too much down
you<00:02:57.819> gotta<00:02:58.000> keep<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.390> little<00:02:58.420> bit<00:02:58.630> flatter
