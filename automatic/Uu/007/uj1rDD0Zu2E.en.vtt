00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.150 

I've<00:00:27.300> made<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.600> couple<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.109> more<00:00:28.830> o's<00:00:30.980> since<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
I've made a couple of more o's since the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.350 
I've made a couple of more o's since the
last<00:00:32.369> video

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.430 

so<00:00:37.900> we're<00:00:38.140> going<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:40.210> this<00:00:40.450> by<00:00:41.110> slip

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
so we're going to do this by slip

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.380 
so we're going to do this by slip
stitching<00:00:42.010> on<00:00:43.500> top<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:45.130> of<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.970> Afghan

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
stitching on top of the of the Afghan

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
stitching on top of the of the Afghan
stitch<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:48.130> we<00:00:49.090> are<00:00:49.180> going<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.510> do<00:00:49.870> this<00:00:50.170> by

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.530 

inserting<00:00:54.489> our<00:00:55.059> hook<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.340> first<00:00:57.640> vertical

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
inserting our hook to the first vertical

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.870 
inserting our hook to the first vertical
loop<00:00:58.930> just<00:00:59.230> like<00:00:59.680> that<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:03.720> below<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:05.110> loop

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
loop just like that and below this loop

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.090 
loop just like that and below this loop
on<00:01:06.880> top<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.680> through<00:01:09.070> both<00:01:09.340> loops<00:01:11.070> wrap<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
on top so through both loops wrap the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.270 
on top so through both loops wrap the
yarn<00:01:12.369> over<00:01:12.729> your<00:01:13.300> hook<00:01:15.090> pull<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.119> through<00:01:17.280> all

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
yarn over your hook pull it through all

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.560 
yarn over your hook pull it through all
those<00:01:18.790> loops<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:20.850> through<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.060> loop<00:01:22.270> you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
those loops and through the loop you

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.410 
those loops and through the loop you
already<00:01:22.780> had<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:25.360> like<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:27.390> insert<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
already had just like that insert the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.670 
already had just like that insert the
hook<00:01:28.720> below<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.910> vertical<00:01:30.910> loop<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:31.680> below

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
hook below the vertical loop and below

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.150 
hook below the vertical loop and below
the<00:01:32.740> loop<00:01:33.160> on<00:01:33.340> top<00:01:36.300> pull<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.570> yarn<00:01:37.750> through

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
the loop on top pull the yarn through

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.110 
the loop on top pull the yarn through
those<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.869> enter<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.140> loop<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.650> had<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:43.060> your

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
those to enter the loop you had on your

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.090 
those to enter the loop you had on your
hook<00:01:45.420> insert<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.750> hook<00:01:46.900> again<00:01:47.080> under<00:01:47.890> those

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
hook insert the hook again under those

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:58.230 
hook insert the hook again under those
two<00:01:49.979> loops<00:01:52.890> pull<00:01:53.890> their<00:01:54.250> slip<00:01:55.180> them<00:01:56.880> half<00:01:57.880> of

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
two loops pull their slip them half of

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.790 
two loops pull their slip them half of
the<00:01:58.450> loop<00:01:58.659> on<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.159> hook

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:21.710 

pull<00:02:08.490> them<00:02:08.790> through<00:02:09.229> all<00:02:10.229> three<00:02:10.650> hooks

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:42.010 

so<00:02:25.319> they<00:02:26.319> put<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.459> hook<00:02:27.640> below<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.180> two<00:02:28.569> loops

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.920 

and<00:02:42.620> we<00:02:42.830> are<00:02:42.890> going<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:43.880> until<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.750> end

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and we are going to do so until the end

00:02:44.930 --> 00:03:33.740 
and we are going to do so until the end
of<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:47.480> row

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.140 

and<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.740> whole<00:03:34.950> bit<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.280> all<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.520> two

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
and so the whole bit of all the two

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:45.650 
and so the whole bit of all the two
ropes<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.170> layout<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.860> them<00:03:41.190> three<00:03:44.660> star

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
ropes and the layout of them three star

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.160 
ropes and the layout of them three star

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
and then up on top of the chain pull

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.770 
and then up on top of the chain pull
yeah<00:03:54.930> throw<00:03:55.350> all<00:03:55.530> those<00:03:55.830> two<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.820> throw<00:03:57.570> this

be here so insert your hook through a
slope<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:13.340> look<00:04:14.340> right<00:04:14.700> here

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.640 

wrap<00:04:19.959> your<00:04:20.229> yarn<00:04:20.669> over<00:04:21.669> your<00:04:21.699> hook<00:04:22.620> pull<00:04:23.620> it

wrap your yarn over your hook pull it

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.719 
wrap your yarn over your hook pull it
through<00:04:23.830> those<00:04:24.460> two<00:04:24.849> loops<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:27.039> then<00:04:27.370> upon

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
through those two loops and then upon

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.930 
through those two loops and then upon
your<00:04:27.880> hook<00:04:28.979> just<00:04:29.979> like<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:31.380> now<00:04:32.729> you<00:04:33.729> would

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
your hook just like that now you would

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:42.900 
your hook just like that now you would
want<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:35.970> chain<00:04:36.970> another<00:04:37.419> one<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:41.699> cut<00:04:42.699> your

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
want to chain another one and cut your

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.190 
want to chain another one and cut your
yarn<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:45.490> is

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.580 

how<00:04:50.800> slip<00:04:51.190> stitching<00:04:52.200> it<00:04:53.200> is<00:04:53.770> done<00:04:54.750> on<00:04:55.750> top<00:04:56.380> of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
how slip stitching it is done on top of

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:11.650 
how slip stitching it is done on top of
the<00:04:56.800> album<00:04:57.220> stage

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660
