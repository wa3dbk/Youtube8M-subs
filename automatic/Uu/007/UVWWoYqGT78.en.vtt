00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.800

 But it is also experienced in the is not existential to have if jc Gabriel is cast 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:01:00.850
 Precisely because it is based and I'm a not want to thoroughly share to everyone, but first his 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.210

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.390
 so 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.409
 If you know something hunt like you guys 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.100
 I think I understand 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.620
 The person who is a conscious body who wants to attack 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:32.640
 It began entrusted now to the tribe 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:36.780
 As a result, since that year 92 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.700
 I've kept saying that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.759
 Then what is an alien? 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.000
 What is the What aliens look and 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:53.650
 Then say next what is an exhibition 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.780
 On the basis that their question I'm a reason I've been all the way to continue to do research 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.230
 Day 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.580

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.940
 And went to the ESCO turn any live now want Iona 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.200
 There is a specific contact for the change of two people there 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.360
 In my mind rather than a contour that is seen in the eyes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.360
 You can hear your voice 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:33.740
 Since this time of the broadcast is July Do not try now to the weather finally do is towards the person to be here. 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:38.860
 While enjoying various sports outside 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:45.790
 I am quite relaxed and live my life 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:51.840
 Because this remote island Tsu will be the report of the number one before leaving Japan 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:03:01.819
 I would like to report mainly on recent news 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:10.069
 The purpose of the stay in Japan for almost one month to the current as you propose is going to seminars and lectures 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:16.700
 And in fact, there is also an activity that I visit once again to Onagawa-cho 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:21.810
 It is not about the stage of carrying goods by any means 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.210
 From that point on, including what happened to the disaster area 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.510
 In fact 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.409
 ｰｰｰ foreigners saw 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.409
 It is this book 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.160
 east 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.160
 Book called Japan Earthquake 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:43.079
 Onagawa Chion 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:45.260
 As we include interview of person named Doi, we want to do handing instead directly 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.310
 think 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:55.880
 It is always so, but in Japan for 5 months 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:04:00.470
 Set schedule in setting and move various lectures and seminar events 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.160
 In fact, this time , it will be also the preparation of Arsoon 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.630
 It is 10 people to come 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.680
 If you have made the definition of the word pilgrimage a bit wider 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.769
 Load of new clonus t 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.060
 I would like to go back 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.959
 Naturally there are various people on the way of the road 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:29.759
 Even though it'll do the parks and stamina 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:32.660
 Once again, it's time for you to think about the meaning of this movie. 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.660
 I think there is no 

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:40.889
 Of 2012 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.260
 For the fourth chapter 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.800
 various 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.249
 Mind and body 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.750
 change 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.750
 Trouble 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.060
 Stress 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.080
 accident 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.590
 Relationship issues 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.050
 And wonder if health problems are often 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.190
 More and more 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.880
 almost every day 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.840
 What happened in a certain era 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.070
 People who are looking at this 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.420
 I said already clearly 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.160
 I think it is a disease to break up 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:25.460
 until now 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:28.340
 I would like to conclude my story a little 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:33.500
 With this Ingel story 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:37.070
 Mountain bike of the story is the hell is this are you doing to do what in 2014 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.969
 Cosmic change and response stories 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:44.380
 Everything is here 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:47.340
 We are in this 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.529
 I capture the universe 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:55.210
 The world we are looking at is 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:06:00.009
 Fact is that what we 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:04.340
 I mean it is that it is often said for a long time 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.729
 The universe experiencing the world we are watching 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.110
 Own 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.420
 Not only in Mind 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.529
 Myself to in my mind 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.270
 Living 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.190
 The meaning of that is 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:27.430
 It is this society 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:30.500
 So all things I'm following are all things 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.190
 In the shift of 2012 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.190
 It is related
