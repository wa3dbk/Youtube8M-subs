00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:11.550
 good a little tutorial for emptying box 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.759
 high moor hours 650 mclister this is the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.759
 box 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.789
 these little plastic plugs without 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:31.700
 force because it's plastic one 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:37.340
 cleans one cleans a screw after one 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.340
 in davis this is the filling screw 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 and that's the drain city then 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 a little trick not to fuck 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.230
 the ul everywhere I take a little 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.840
 plastic lid of boxes 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:08.020
 whatever is flexible 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:10.450
 and I put it under it like that 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.800
 when luc swells is their missteps 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:22.410
 everywhere on the on the protects that is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:28.810
 underneath that and we will unscrew the screw 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:34.210
 of emptying box at davis bridge and he 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:39.090
 need a key of 14.1 in davis for me 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.090
 I already loosen a so in davis 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.789
 be careful not to drop the bolt 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.509
 to put the slightest goal 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.509
 possible in the hands 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.370
 but there 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.600
 are careful not to lose 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:13.860
 joints apparently there are two and one 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.510
 let it flow quietly so the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:26.580
 little bib goes well we do not care 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:28.760
 everywhere so both 14 for plugs 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.760
 in plastic 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.720
 it's a clique 15 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.890
 we are going to let calmly flow is 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.370
 good black 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.370
 it's good to do it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:00.650
 good for the oil so I use 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:05.720
 the ippon the a34 box fight and 8 of 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.060
 cdh bridge at 80 90 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.570
 and as the constructor imposes a happy 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.330
 special so we learned I took 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:19.430
 like a happy one we do not see too well 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:24.500
 on camera these carpets g l five the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:28.240
 advice from 75 90 1 but good to 80 90 that 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:34.130
 is fine for 4-stroke engines 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.130
 hoti lindry when we took two because 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.570
 that I have the bridges to do too 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.690
 therefore the capacity and 400 milliliters 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.209
 for the box 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.650
 so that's not much and for them 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.630
 bridges are 650 lander maxis you are in front 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.050
 he recommends 500 milliliters 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.180
 and behind 250 that's for info in 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.180
 more and ben nan there we are on the box 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:12.010
 so it's gone, it's still flowing 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:17.500
 a little we will let flow for 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:22.080
 after putting the cap back we will clean 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.130
 that meanwhile but change the joints 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:36.550
 we still see who has a lot of 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:37.980
 dab on the tip is not too there we do not 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.120
 do not go too well 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:45.419
 finally it's really dirty 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:49.570
 clean up good life it's been reassembled 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.419
 clean up tight rise from there we go 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.620
 can do the filling then for 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.770
 I have a little trick a little 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.720
 graduated container beat laval up 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.030
 300 activists it takes 400 minutes and a 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.060
 tiny funnel 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:15.520
 with a small tip at the end 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.080
 able to put it in and be able to 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.240
 quietly fill the small or 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.040
 a little better here is put in and fill 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.919
 so we will fill it normally these 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.770
 four hundred thousand fast but must for the 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:36.490
 box can be identified at the thread 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:39.340
 that is to say, at the level of a stage internship 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.479
 times the oil romy 400 milliliters 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.590
 it happens at the flower of 1,2 no screws 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.510
 presents the plastic plug puts 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.360
 really squeezing it very gently 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.669
 because precisely he plastics for 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.450
 not that the son is damaged, it's just 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:01.090
 a quarter turn and without forcing and the 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.150
 emptying box is over here 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.740
 I hope these little news will you 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.360
 serve if you want to do a drain 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.699
 on another land hours 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.699
 658 100 or 500 this is him
