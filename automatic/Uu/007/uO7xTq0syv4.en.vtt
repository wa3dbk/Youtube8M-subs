00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
so I'm going to show you a few piping

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.980 
so I'm going to show you a few piping
techniques<00:00:06.680> with<00:00:06.890> three<00:00:07.160> piping<00:00:08.090> tips<00:00:08.299> first

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
techniques with three piping tips first

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.310 
techniques with three piping tips first
one<00:00:09.200> is<00:00:09.469> a<00:00:09.530> star<00:00:09.950> chip<00:00:10.190> the<00:00:11.059> second<00:00:11.450> one<00:00:11.600> is<00:00:11.900> a

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
one is a star chip the second one is a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.180 
one is a star chip the second one is a
petal<00:00:12.680> tip<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.850> third<00:00:14.029> one<00:00:14.209> is<00:00:14.420> a<00:00:14.449> leaf<00:00:14.779> tip

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
petal tip the third one is a leaf tip

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.410 
petal tip the third one is a leaf tip
now<00:00:16.190> with<00:00:16.340> our<00:00:16.369> star<00:00:16.730> chip<00:00:16.970> i'm<00:00:17.090> going<00:00:17.240> to<00:00:17.300> show

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
now with our star chip i'm going to show

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.420 
now with our star chip i'm going to show
you<00:00:17.449> real<00:00:17.750> simple<00:00:18.230> border<00:00:18.680> it's<00:00:19.130> called<00:00:19.310> a

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
you real simple border it's called a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.859 
you real simple border it's called a
shell<00:00:19.670> border<00:00:19.850> it's<00:00:20.150> really<00:00:20.420> popular<00:00:20.630> in

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
shell border it's really popular in

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.339 
shell border it's really popular in
cakes<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.449> cupcakes<00:00:23.449> and<00:00:24.019> it's<00:00:24.199> really

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
cakes and cupcakes and it's really

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.640 
cakes and cupcakes and it's really
simple<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.769> do<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.640> I'm<00:00:25.759> going<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:25.939> do<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.650> hold

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
simple to do so I'm going to do is hold

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.970 
simple to do so I'm going to do is hold
it<00:00:27.800> on<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.009> 45<00:00:28.669> degree<00:00:28.849> angle<00:00:29.710> I'm<00:00:30.710> going<00:00:30.859> to

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
it on a 45 degree angle I'm going to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.679 
it on a 45 degree angle I'm going to
squeeze<00:00:31.369> put<00:00:31.699> a<00:00:31.730> lot<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:31.970> pressure<00:00:32.270> in<00:00:32.599> the

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
squeeze put a lot of pressure in the

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.810 
squeeze put a lot of pressure in the
beginning<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:33.170> then<00:00:34.100> as<00:00:34.220> you're<00:00:34.400> going<00:00:34.610> back

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
beginning and then as you're going back

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.119 
beginning and then as you're going back
you're<00:00:35.060> going<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.329> release<00:00:35.630> pressure<00:00:36.129> because

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
you're going to release pressure because

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.510 
you're going to release pressure because
you<00:00:37.219> want<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.550> big<00:00:37.820> bulb<00:00:38.149> up<00:00:38.420> there<00:00:38.449> so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
you want that big bulb up there so

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.639 
you want that big bulb up there so
you're<00:00:40.520> going<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.760> squeeze<00:00:41.239> go<00:00:42.079> forward<00:00:42.590> a

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
you're going to squeeze go forward a

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.500 
you're going to squeeze go forward a
little<00:00:42.800> bit<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.219> come<00:00:43.640> back<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.180> release

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
little bit and come back and release

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.759 
little bit and come back and release
pressure<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.800> do<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.820> row<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:48.620> that

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
pressure and do that in a row and that

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.200 
pressure and do that in a row and that
makes<00:00:48.920> for<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.129> really<00:00:49.309> pretty<00:00:49.699> border<00:00:50.090> around

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
makes for a really pretty border around

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.650 
makes for a really pretty border around
your<00:00:50.480> cakes<00:00:50.750> that's<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.559> first<00:00:51.800> one<00:00:52.660> the

you're always going to have the narrow

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.800 
you're always going to have the narrow
end<00:01:06.560> of<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.340> petal<00:01:07.610> tip<00:01:07.760> facing<00:01:08.180> up<00:01:08.300> and<00:01:08.540> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
end of the petal tip facing up and the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.109 
end of the petal tip facing up and the
fatter<00:01:09.020> end<00:01:09.200> facing<00:01:09.650> down<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.460> want<00:01:10.640> this<00:01:10.850> end

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
fatter end facing down you want this end

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.280 
fatter end facing down you want this end
facing<00:01:11.479> up<00:01:11.600> because<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.900> makes<00:01:12.020> for<00:01:12.170> really

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
facing up because it makes for really

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.090 
facing up because it makes for really
delicate<00:01:12.829> nice<00:01:13.070> fragile<00:01:13.670> petals<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
delicate nice fragile petals so the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.550 
delicate nice fragile petals so the
motion<00:01:16.460> for<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:16.759> is<00:01:17.829> you're<00:01:18.829> going<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.420> start

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
motion for this is you're going to start

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.469 
motion for this is you're going to start
with<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.590> lot<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:21.950> pressure<00:01:22.159> at<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:22.970> 45<00:01:23.450> degree

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
with a lot of pressure at a 45 degree

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.980 
with a lot of pressure at a 45 degree
angle<00:01:24.130> go<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.250> an<00:01:25.369> arch<00:01:25.579> bring<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.689> right<00:01:26.930> back

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
angle go in an arch bring it right back

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.950 
angle go in an arch bring it right back
to<00:01:27.439> where<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:27.649> started<00:01:28.570> cpg<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.750> few

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
to where you started cpg that a few

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.590 
to where you started cpg that a few
times<00:01:30.070> get<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.189> hang<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.579> motion<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
times get the hang of that motion the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.590 
times get the hang of that motion the
nice<00:01:32.930> arch<00:01:33.610> always<00:01:34.610> end<00:01:34.850> back<00:01:35.270> where<00:01:35.509> you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
nice arch always end back where you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.840 
nice arch always end back where you
first<00:01:35.840> started<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.640> then<00:01:38.390> with<00:01:38.570> our<00:01:38.600> leaf<00:01:39.020> tip

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
first started and then with our leaf tip

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.810 
first started and then with our leaf tip
this<00:01:40.850> makes<00:01:41.090> our<00:01:41.240> leaves

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
this makes our leaves

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.580 
this makes our leaves
now<00:01:43.820> our<00:01:44.030> leave<00:01:44.179> tip<00:01:44.390> looks<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.960> prong<00:01:45.289> and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
now our leave tip looks like a prong and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.590 
now our leave tip looks like a prong and
you're<00:01:46.219> going<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.399> want<00:01:46.609> to<00:01:46.759> hold<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.450> that

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
you're going to want to hold it so that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.179 
you're going to want to hold it so that
it's<00:01:47.749> vertical<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.590> when<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.799> hold<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.069> the

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
it's vertical so when you hold you the

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.370 
it's vertical so when you hold you the
side<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.490> looks<00:01:49.549> like<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.759> little<00:01:50.030> mouth<00:01:50.380> so

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
side it looks like a little mouth so

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.469 
side it looks like a little mouth so
you're<00:01:51.469> going<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.619> hold<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:52.039> 45<00:01:52.969> degree<00:01:53.210> angle

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
you're going to hold it 45 degree angle

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.559 
you're going to hold it 45 degree angle
these<00:01:53.659> are<00:01:53.780> all<00:01:53.899> held<00:01:54.259> at<00:01:54.409> 45<00:01:54.770> degree<00:01:55.009> angle

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
these are all held at 45 degree angle

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.109 
these are all held at 45 degree angle
you're<00:01:56.569> just<00:01:56.689> going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.929> squeeze<00:01:57.850> put<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.880> lot

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
you're just going to squeeze put a lot

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.209 
you're just going to squeeze put a lot
of<00:01:59.149> pressure<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.439> as<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.799> pull<00:02:01.069> away

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
of pressure and then as you pull away

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.190 
of pressure and then as you pull away
you're<00:02:01.549> going<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.759> slowly<00:02:02.509> ease<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.049> pressure

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
you're going to slowly ease the pressure

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.429 
you're going to slowly ease the pressure
off<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.039> get<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.219> nice<00:02:04.399> point<00:02:04.759> at<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.060> end

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
off so you get a nice point at the end

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.240 
off so you get a nice point at the end
depending<00:02:06.439> on<00:02:06.530> how<00:02:06.709> big<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.039> want<00:02:07.159> your

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
flowers and then add the leaf and then

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.530 
flowers and then add the leaf and then
put<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> nice<00:02:28.430> border<00:02:28.790> around<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.239> have
