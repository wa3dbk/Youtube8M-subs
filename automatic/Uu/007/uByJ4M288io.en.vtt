00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 all beaver dear swami friends in india 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.500
 There is one not noticed thing which 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 would have changed Scott on my site 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 that we usually remember 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.679
 he had 8 7 8 7 8 7 in the source code 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 the site 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.710
 ok that meant that fnaf4 somehow 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.730
 way related to the bite but now there 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 one other thing appeared not 87 but 83 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.760
 and I have two options that it can 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.290
 mean 1 83 may indicate year in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.640
 which happens on v-4 year 1983 then 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 it explains why 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 background and room design is so weird and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 so old 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 for example there is a lava lamp which 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.870
 was famous in the seventies 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 eighties 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.879
 then we get in the source code 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.070
 h3 dates 83 87 and 93 2093 about 2093 i 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.030
 talked in this video is interesting 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.820
 you can see 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 In general, it all came down to the fact that 2093 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 probably meant 1 1982 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.220
 but then again it turns out 3 dates 82 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.409
 83 87 can it be that scott is all this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 one small time hid from us 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.799
 The moment that in fnaf 4 will be none 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.939
 location like i said before and three like me 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.820
 actually said before will be 82 83 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.829
 also 87 years old and it will all be 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 occur in different locations 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.909
 or in the same house on in different 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.790
 years this is possible although it was not 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.610
 no hint from scott should 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.060
 would there be something else there is another 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.840
 see option 83 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.670
 august the third thing is that month in 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.360
 foreign date is indicated by 1 second 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 indicates the number of August 3, given that 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.729
 what's our game coming out on August 8 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.729
 maybe it's such a little joke from 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.909
 scott which indicates that dna will be released 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.530
 August 3, after all, 83 is laid out completely 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.009
 recently i would say yesterday 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.250
 about yesterday 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.470
 he issued a demo foreign youtuber 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.720
 so dna is exactly ready for him and he 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.230
 and can survive at any time e.g. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.459
 August 3 what he decided to show in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.620
 your source code 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.930
 so sum up we have two options 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.450
 first option is that 83 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.280
 this is another year in which somehow either 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.549
 we will take part either he will somehow 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.959
 be related to fnaf4 and the second option 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.230
 that 83 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.980
 this month is the eighth month the third day 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.870
 August 3 release date or demo 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.359
 either games but i guess that's all 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.099
 same demo and what do you think write in 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.349
 comments well, that's all expensive 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.459
 friends all thanks for watching bye 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.459
 bye bye good luck
