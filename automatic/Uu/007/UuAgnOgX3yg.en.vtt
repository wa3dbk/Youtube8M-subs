00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
that the general consensus is just that

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.510 
that the general consensus is just that
the<00:05:01.430> game<00:05:01.669> will<00:05:02.120> die<00:05:02.479> come<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.320> update<00:05:03.710> so

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520

this is my one question to Jagex
is<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.300> worth<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.780> risk

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
is it worth the risk
