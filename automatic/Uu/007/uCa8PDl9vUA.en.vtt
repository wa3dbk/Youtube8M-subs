00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.460
 so it is welcome to 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.870
 bake and cook with stefan maybe 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.689
 just realize that I have one 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.529
 new camera a small hd camera 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.830
 video camera around customs a bit 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.020
 better picture and a little better 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.380
 to give tone 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.610
 I hope it works to show 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.550
 I'll give you a pie base today 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.040
 Above all , you can wait a little better 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.050
 uniform one has often the problem 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.059
 that he does that without a world power or 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.120
 gets cracks or even right 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.969
 bursts open the can you with a few 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 Easily reduce tools or 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:04.089
 even completely avoided 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:08.710
 For this we need kitchen paper something 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.110
 water and i take here paperclips 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.789
 but you can brace two pieces 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.720
 uray now take it must hold out 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.110
 be metal 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.330
 otherwise you can take what you 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 do you want to once the scope 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.179
 eat their baking dish 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.599
 accordingly the alufoil and the 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.390
 kitchen paper cut off about five 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:36.729
 centimeters longer than 10 cm 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.840
 we can cut that off afterwards 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:45.899
 rather a little too long than short even 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:54.580
 next to how the kitchen paper in the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:02:00.539
 insert aluminum foil and fold to center 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.539
 that he is third in principle 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 it should be the height of the baking mold afterwards 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.260
 given something too high is not a problem 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.730
 but less than the amount of growth 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.730
 it must not be 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.870
 have asked for these stripes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.269
 the water gently pours it on 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:46.410
 the kitchen paper so that 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:49.620
 kitchen paper absorbs everything if that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.010
 kitchen paper of water is the aluminum foil 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.010
 1 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:13.870
 so we then get a cuff 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 which end is her something to which no 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:25.209
 paper looks out what we here 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:34.420
 Now you can burn yours 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 back for develops the baking mold 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:50.159
 rhine a little too long would have 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:53.919
 merge and then go 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:59.310
 paper clips or hair clips or how 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.310
 always forgiven 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:15.299
 important is not to overlap because 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.600
 At this point, then it takes delicious 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.030
 until that day just ghost like that 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.130
 wrapping up these trends a bit too 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:31.509
 long is no problem better than 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.690
 to pay attention to it is still the 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.970
 baking time is about 30 and 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.639
 percent 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.380
 retain the soil in the eye makes for 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.860
 appropriate time the township sample 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.229
 then you are on the safe side 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.849
 I hope that helps little tools 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.590
 you something and you turn on 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.020
 Next time when it says 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.020
 bake and cook with stefan wyss si
