00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.929
 Tuesday I am very happy because I 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.430
 meeting in london one of the cities 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.430
 most beautiful in the world 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.460
 we will make a sketch of the 'big ben' 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 through the river Thames in the foreground 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.850
 we will bluff this will be the most 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.760
 dark I will not draw people the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.250
 boats or anything like that when I draw is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.089
 a landscape is good to have something in the first 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 plane that will stand out and something very far 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.910
 that is going to be ideally tenuous too 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 you are going to have a flat month this is going to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 Give depth of field to the drawing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 after some curved lines on the side 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.399
 left that will help me with the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.399
 perspective 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.700
 and now let's make the buildings 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.810
 how I want what is to the 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:25.320
 distance look clear I'm using 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.890
 a lace lasts an h instead 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.850
 the bluff I will use a 3 by a 6 b 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.400
 very soft 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.930
 you can see the list of materials in the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.930
 information under the video 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.640
 I will not try to do this 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.240
 perfectly or in detail this is the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.299
 charm of the sketches I recommend you 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.290
 do all these sketches you can 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.020
 they are very beneficial and delicious 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.530
 I mean it's delicious to draw them 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.229
 do not go eat them 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 my jokes are coming out every time I think 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.850
 that the other day I found someone 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.170
 who told me I love your tutorials to 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.170
 despite the bad 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.340
 ok i will try not to do so many 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.590
 better let's continue with the drawing 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.110
 Of course the lanterns should go 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.670
 making more and more smaller and more 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.670
 tenuous by the distance 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.130
 and I put 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.040
 as I told you at the beginning what is going 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.040
 the distance must be very clear 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 let's make some tree leaves and some clouds 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.739
 on the other side the reason why I'm going to 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.469
 put more intense clouds on the side 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 right is because I feel that the 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:07.620
 left was getting too 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:11.099
 heavy with the leaves and the lantern and so 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.980
 so much had to compensate and the 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.930
 Blur with the brush please tell me in 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.750

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.359
