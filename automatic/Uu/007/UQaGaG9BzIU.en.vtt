00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.070
 now handsome the Swede Tuesday 8 because you can see how the time 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.850
 children go away, and the little girl is the mother of the little ones 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.459
 Become a nation 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.079
 if you assume 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.999
 that the German average weight 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.949
 at the earliest with 14 or 15 years starts for politics 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.770
 or to interest politicians 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.349
 you have to be clear 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.169
 That's almost always nice for under 25-year-olds in the state of Angela Merkel 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.019
 Chairman of the CDU has been 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.390
 and only those over the age of 35 should have a memory of it like Angela Merkel 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 from which nothing emerged as Minister in Cabinet Kohl 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.310
 Who would have thought that this timid young woman would not have been ten years old? 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.390
 Later, without batting an eyelid, her promoter and mentor Helmut Kohl 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.330
 also dispose of swan place as honorary chairman of the CDU brand new and 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.670
 almost in passing Wolfgang Schäuble as party chairman push aside 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.600
 should 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.000
 who knows yet that our girls courage the two races around the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.640
 cdu-presidency anno 2000 fight pigs like Volker Rühe has slowed down 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.940
 At that time, she must have gotten a taste 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.770
 she then stumble upon emptying run Roland Koch and Christian Wulff 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.610
 whether distance kept Schroeder out of office and last but not least Friedrich 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.210
 Merz so frustrated that recovering his cock intervened and out of the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.000
 Politics withdrew 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.480
 Mirror Mirror on the wall who has the most scalps in his hand 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.080
 of course invited 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.160
 the political angel of death from the Uckermark 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.270
 by now she no longer has any natural enemies 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.090
 Most recently she joined the grand coalition of Frank-Walter Steinmeier 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.800
 App taken to the chest that no one knows whether the SPD everyone will fully recover 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.500
 At the moment she is cooking for Westerwelle and already has the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.150
 delicious greens in the eye of submission in a black and green 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.280
 Coalition could be their next big project 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.509
 and since she no longer tries to make his policy on her completely 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.359
 Being focused on being a Chancellor will make her more relaxed by the day and so on 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.849
 who should also be dangerous here Sigmar Gabriel Andrea Nahles 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.709
 any seriously meant suggestions 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.549
 Now it is no longer about other parties as they 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.689
 Chancellor to replace in the future general election is 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.179
 always just go to who's on top of the shot 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.879
 till 9
