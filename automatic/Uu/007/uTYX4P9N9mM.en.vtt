00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
ATM location I didn't know this for the

to find locations to deposit my money

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.570 
to find locations to deposit my money
and<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> perfect

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and this is going to be a perfect

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.490 
and this is going to be a perfect
example<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.570> why<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.869> guys<00:00:28.050> should<00:00:28.410> probably

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
example of why you guys should probably

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
example of why you guys should probably
just<00:00:28.830> use<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.010> phone<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
just use the phone it's going to be a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.189 
just use the phone it's going to be a
lot<00:00:30.119> easier<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> people<00:00:31.109> are

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
lot easier I know a lot of people are

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.990 
lot easier I know a lot of people are
doing<00:00:31.260> videos<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> ATM<00:00:32.309> locations<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.969> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
doing videos on the ATM locations it is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.910 
doing videos on the ATM locations it is
a<00:00:33.090> cool<00:00:33.360> feature<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.710> not

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
a cool feature but it's really not

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
a cool feature but it's really not
necessary<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.940> probably<00:00:36.270> could<00:00:36.420> cost<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
necessary and it probably could cost you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
necessary and it probably could cost you
some<00:00:37.020> money<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> guys<00:00:38.160> saw<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
some money so as you guys saw in the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
some money so as you guys saw in the
beginning<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> video<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.570> picked<00:00:40.140> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
beginning of the video I picked this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
random car and I guess I picked the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.979 
random car and I guess I picked the
wrong<00:00:42.030> car<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> messed<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> wrong
