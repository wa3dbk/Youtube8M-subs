blitzing<00:05:22.560> we<00:05:22.919> get<00:05:23.040> enough<00:05:23.310> time<00:05:23.520> take<00:05:23.820> these

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
blitzing we get enough time take these

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.880 
blitzing we get enough time take these
routes<00:05:24.240> because<00:05:24.390> they<00:05:24.600> develop<00:05:25.020> their<00:05:25.169> fairly

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
routes because they develop their fairly

quickly alright guys now the most
dynamic<00:05:28.770> wrapped<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.520> against<00:05:29.790> of<00:05:29.940> what<00:05:30.120> is

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
dynamic wrapped it against of what is

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.010 
dynamic wrapped it against of what is
our<00:05:31.080> circle<00:05:31.680> route<00:05:31.800> or<00:05:31.979> far-right<00:05:32.520> receiver

our circle route or far-right receiver
reason<00:05:34.020> being<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.380> because<00:05:34.410> when<00:05:34.860> it's<00:05:35.010> one<00:05:35.190> on

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
reason being is because when it's one on

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.490 
reason being is because when it's one on
one<00:05:35.370> we<00:05:36.240> can<00:05:36.450> do<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:36.810> many<00:05:36.900> things<00:05:37.020> like<00:05:37.320> right

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
one we can do so many things like right

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.740 
one we can do so many things like right
here<00:05:37.680> we're<00:05:37.830> putting<00:05:38.400> them<00:05:38.520> on<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.669> zig<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.210> you

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
here we're putting them on a zig and you

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.420 
here we're putting them on a zig and you
can<00:05:39.900> get<00:05:40.140> that<00:05:40.169> man<00:05:40.470> beater<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:40.860> sometimes

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
can get that man beater and sometimes

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.400 
can get that man beater and sometimes
you'll<00:05:41.580> catch<00:05:41.760> it<00:05:41.790> more<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.450> run<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:42.900> you'll

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
you'll catch it more and run and you'll

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.180 
you'll catch it more and run and you'll
be<00:05:43.500> able<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.710> take<00:05:43.919> off<00:05:45.770> okay<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:46.830> now<00:05:47.070> we're

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
be able to take off okay so now we're

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.620 
be able to take off okay so now we're
going<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.340> target<00:05:47.640> circle<00:05:48.120> again<00:05:48.330> but<00:05:48.540> this

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
going to target circle again but this

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.180 
going to target circle again but this
time<00:05:48.690> we're<00:05:48.960> gonna<00:05:49.050> make<00:05:49.260> him<00:05:49.470> dragged<00:05:50.010> across

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
time we're gonna make him dragged across

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.130 
time we're gonna make him dragged across
the<00:05:50.400> middle<00:05:50.729> of<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.850> field<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.210> this<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.900> the

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
the middle of the field and this is the

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.320 
the middle of the field and this is the
easiest<00:05:52.800> way<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.040> tear<00:05:53.370> up<00:05:53.460> one<00:05:53.850> on<00:05:53.970> one<00:05:54.150> man

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
easiest way to tear up one on one man

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330 
easiest way to tear up one on one man
coverage<00:05:54.720> if<00:05:55.050> they're<00:05:55.380> not<00:05:55.530> bumping<00:05:55.979> because

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
coverage if they're not bumping because

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.550 
coverage if they're not bumping because
he<00:05:56.880> will<00:05:57.000> get<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.270> basically<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.750> huge<00:05:58.200> speed

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
he will get it basically a huge speed

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.640 
he will get it basically a huge speed
burst<00:05:58.820> across<00:05:59.820> the<00:06:00.000> middle<00:06:00.380> okay<00:06:01.380> so<00:06:01.440> now

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
burst across the middle okay so now

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.050 
burst across the middle okay so now
we're<00:06:01.770> going<00:06:01.890> into<00:06:02.070> this<00:06:02.370> again<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.790> what's

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
we're going into this again and what's

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.700 
we're going into this again and what's
awesome<00:06:03.240> we<00:06:03.540> can<00:06:03.690> just<00:06:03.810> lob<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.260> up<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.470> Julio

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
awesome we can just lob it up to Julio

awesome we can just lob it up to Julio
Jones<00:06:04.919> on<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.250> right<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:05.640> he<00:06:05.760> will<00:06:05.880> get

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
Jones on the right and he will get

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.650 
Jones on the right and he will get
instant

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
instant

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.230 
instant
and<00:06:07.260> he'll<00:06:07.680> use<00:06:07.710> his<00:06:08.070> big<00:06:08.250> body<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.730> cover<00:06:09.000> and

and he'll use his big body to cover and

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.330 
and he'll use his big body to cover and
make<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.630> catch<00:06:09.860> lastly<00:06:10.860> we're<00:06:11.070> going<00:06:11.190> to<00:06:11.250> go

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
make the catch lastly we're going to go

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.860 
make the catch lastly we're going to go
up<00:06:11.460> against<00:06:11.730> the<00:06:11.880> zone<00:06:12.060> blitz<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.660> not<00:06:12.840> just

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
up against the zone blitz and not just

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.380 
up against the zone blitz and not just
any<00:06:13.140> zone<00:06:13.500> blitz<00:06:13.710> but<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.280> hot<00:06:14.820> rounded<00:06:15.210> zone

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
any zone blitz but a hot rounded zone

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.970 
any zone blitz but a hot rounded zone
but<00:06:15.600> switch<00:06:15.780> would<00:06:15.900> be<00:06:16.110> more<00:06:16.350> effective<00:06:16.440> and

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
but switch would be more effective and

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.010 
but switch would be more effective and
by<00:06:17.280> doing<00:06:17.460> this<00:06:17.670> we're<00:06:17.850> going<00:06:17.970> to<00:06:18.060> put<00:06:18.720> guys<00:06:18.960> on

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
by doing this we're going to put guys on

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.050 
by doing this we're going to put guys on
one<00:06:19.410> side<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.800> field<00:06:19.920> blitzing<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.670> Max

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
one side of the field blitzing and Max

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.810 
one side of the field blitzing and Max
ABS<00:06:21.300> on<00:06:21.480> the<00:06:21.630> other<00:06:21.750> side<00:06:22.020> of<00:06:22.050> field<00:06:22.320> so<00:06:23.190> this

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
ABS on the other side of field so this

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.040 
ABS on the other side of field so this
is<00:06:23.850> typical<00:06:24.420> you're<00:06:24.630> going<00:06:24.750> to<00:06:24.810> see<00:06:24.930> online

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
is typical you're going to see online

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.770 
is typical you're going to see online
guys<00:06:26.010> giving<00:06:26.610> you<00:06:26.700> a<00:06:26.730> weird<00:06:27.030> look<00:06:27.240> making<00:06:27.720> the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
guys giving you a weird look making the

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.270 
guys giving you a weird look making the
pressure<00:06:28.080> come<00:06:28.350> from<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.590> outside<00:06:28.980> on<00:06:29.100> one

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
pressure come from the outside on one

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.870 
pressure come from the outside on one
side<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.760> normally<00:06:30.690> one<00:06:30.900> side<00:06:31.170> is<00:06:31.470> open<00:06:32.430> for

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
side and normally one side is open for
