00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
going to put back together with some

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.860 
going to put back together with some
just<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.530> line<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.920> glue<00:01:07.130> down<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.360> center<00:01:08.840> and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
just a line of glue down the center and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.160 
just a line of glue down the center and
just<00:01:09.110> place<00:01:09.530> each<00:01:09.799> one<00:01:10.130> back<00:01:10.450> on<00:01:11.450> top<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:12.020> each

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
just place each one back on top of each

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.370 
just place each one back on top of each
other<00:01:12.440> so<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.010> little<00:01:13.510> pages<00:01:14.510> do<00:01:14.900> actually

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
other so the little pages do actually

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.420 
other so the little pages do actually
open<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.720> don't<00:01:17.720> think<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:18.170> um<00:01:18.440> die<00:01:18.860> set<00:01:19.250> is

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
open I don't think this um die set is

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.910 
open I don't think this um die set is
used<00:01:19.760> near<00:01:20.090> as<00:01:20.360> much<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.140> many<00:01:21.260> people<00:01:21.409> say

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
used near as much as so many people say

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.270 
used near as much as so many people say
to<00:01:21.950> me<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.840> mean<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.470> didn't<00:01:24.740> know<00:01:24.799> what<00:01:25.100> to

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to me that I mean I didn't know what to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.550 
to me that I mean I didn't know what to
do<00:01:25.430> with<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.570> buy<00:01:26.750> these<00:01:27.020> things<00:01:27.350> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
do with it so we buy these things and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.289 
do with it so we buy these things and
often<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:27.979> don't<00:01:28.190> know<00:01:28.369> what<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.820> do<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.119> them

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
often we don't know what to do with them

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.469 
often we don't know what to do with them
so<00:01:29.540> here's<00:01:29.869> another<00:01:30.110> idea<00:01:30.880> for<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.299> just

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
so here's another idea for you so just

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.679 
so here's another idea for you so just
stick<00:01:32.750> them<00:01:32.960> back<00:01:33.110> together<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:35.270> fold<00:01:35.570> that

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
stick them back together you fold that

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.020 
stick them back together you fold that
up<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.229> just<00:01:36.380> let<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.590> dry<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.310> taters<00:01:37.880> are

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
up and just let it dry so taters are

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.710 
up and just let it dry so taters are
still<00:01:38.270> going<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.750> be<00:01:39.380> usable<00:01:40.090> now<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.150> give<00:01:41.510> my

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
still going to be usable now to give my

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.899 
still going to be usable now to give my
book<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:42.080> raised<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.130> know<00:01:43.159> puffy<00:01:43.670> page

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
book that raised you know puffy page

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.719 
book that raised you know puffy page
look<00:01:44.240> I've<00:01:44.360> put<00:01:44.630> two<00:01:44.900> strips<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.530> foam<00:01:46.369> tape

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
look I've put two strips of foam tape

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.710 
look I've put two strips of foam tape
down<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.720> back<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:48.759> strip<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.970> glue<00:01:50.299> down<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
down the back a strip of glue down the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.109 
down the back a strip of glue down the
middle<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.590> strip<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.009> glue<00:01:52.189> either<00:01:52.610> side

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
middle and a strip of glue either side

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.840 
middle and a strip of glue either side
now<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.020> trick<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.159> lay<00:01:55.820> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
now the trick to this is to lay the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.880 
now the trick to this is to lay the
middle<00:01:56.330> down<00:01:56.509> first<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:58.579> your<00:01:58.790> book<00:01:59.619> puff<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
middle down first on your book puff the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.559 
middle down first on your book puff the
pages<00:02:01.340> up<00:02:01.520> as<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.880> stick<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.799> foam<00:02:03.799> down<00:02:07.569> to

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
pages up as you stick that foam down to

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.370 
pages up as you stick that foam down to
the<00:02:08.659> last<00:02:08.840> page

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
the last page

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.340 
the last page
and<00:02:10.710> then<00:02:11.190> move<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:12.090> those<00:02:12.830> edges<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:16.200> not

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and then move on those edges it's not

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.160 
and then move on those edges it's not
gonna<00:02:16.530> be<00:02:17.130> totally<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.910> puffy<00:02:18.600> looking<00:02:18.930> like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
gonna be totally like puffy looking like

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.710 
gonna be totally like puffy looking like
both<00:02:19.440> cuz<00:02:19.770> there's<00:02:20.010> separate<00:02:20.850> pages<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.540> there

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
both cuz there's separate pages in there

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.500 
both cuz there's separate pages in there
remember<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.410> winging<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.300> don't<00:02:24.300> know<00:02:24.390> with

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
remember I'm winging I don't know with

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.030 
remember I'm winging I don't know with
our<00:02:24.630> time<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:24.960> just<00:02:25.110> winging<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.740> haven't

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
our time I'm just winging this I haven't

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.340 
our time I'm just winging this I haven't
got<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.300> finished<00:02:27.300> card<00:02:27.540> actually<00:02:27.690> done<00:02:28.170> I'm

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
got a finished card actually done I'm

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.400 
got a finished card actually done I'm
just<00:02:28.850> fiddling<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.120> go<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.110> like

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
just fiddling as I go but you can like

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 
just fiddling as I go but you can like
puff<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> pages<00:02:32.280> up<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.300> you'll

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
puff the pages up like that then you'll

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.450 
puff the pages up like that then you'll
still<00:02:33.690> get<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> same<00:02:34.050> effect<00:02:35.060> okay<00:02:37.460> right

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
still get the same effect okay right

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.780 
still get the same effect okay right
okay<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.750> attach<00:02:40.170> our<00:02:40.440> book<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.950> we're

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
okay so to attach our book on we're

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.600 
okay so to attach our book on we're
going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.180> make<00:02:42.570> our<00:02:42.810> lattice<00:02:43.170> part<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
going to make our lattice part of it and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.910 
going to make our lattice part of it and
so<00:02:44.670> we're<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.360> put<00:02:45.630> spots<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.320> glue<00:02:46.620> on

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
so we're going to put spots of glue on

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.960 
so we're going to put spots of glue on
each<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.550> those<00:02:47.700> points<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.690> book<00:02:48.990> shape

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
each of those points on this book shape

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.850 
each of those points on this book shape
and<00:02:51.170> grab<00:02:52.170> your<00:02:52.850> one<00:02:53.850> eighth<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.600> an<00:02:54.780> inch<00:02:54.930> wide

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
and grab your one eighth of an inch wide

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.670 
and grab your one eighth of an inch wide
strips<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:58.050> glue<00:02:58.110> them<00:02:58.680> on<00:03:00.350> group<00:03:01.350> glued

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
strips and glue them on group glued

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.770 
strips and glue them on group glued
across<00:03:02.070> across<00:03:02.610> piece<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.630> going

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
across across piece on and this is going

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.470 
across across piece on and this is going
to<00:03:04.020> be<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.380> lattice<00:03:05.190> structure<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:06.030> hold<00:03:06.240> your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
to be the lattice structure to hold your

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.030 
to be the lattice structure to hold your
booking<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.900> think<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.200> said<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.770> didn't

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
booking I think I just said that didn't

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:18.790 
booking I think I just said that didn't
I<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.260> last<00:03:10.500> one<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.760> across<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.240> center

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.370 

okay<00:03:19.800> so<00:03:19.860> I've<00:03:20.160> put<00:03:20.430> my<00:03:20.690> inside<00:03:21.690> piece<00:03:21.990> in<00:03:22.230> to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
okay so I've put my inside piece in to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.020 
okay so I've put my inside piece in to
cover<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.770> all<00:03:22.980> those<00:03:23.100> messy<00:03:23.340> pieces<00:03:23.880> like

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
cover up all those messy pieces like

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.540 
cover up all those messy pieces like
I've<00:03:24.180> shown<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.690> other<00:03:24.810> videos<00:03:24.960> and<00:03:25.680> that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
I've shown you in other videos and that

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.130 
I've shown you in other videos and that
is<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:27.060> card<00:03:27.540> front<00:03:28.100> done<00:03:29.100> we'll<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.610> stick

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
is your card front done we'll just stick

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.530 
is your card front done we'll just stick
our<00:03:31.140> lattice<00:03:31.620> part<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.280> well<00:03:32.880> part<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
our lattice part of it well part of the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.660 
our lattice part of it well part of the
lattice<00:03:33.810> part<00:03:34.110> on<00:03:34.380> which<00:03:34.740> is<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> book<00:03:35.310> this

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
lattice part on which is the book this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.510 
lattice part on which is the book this
time<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:37.050> I'm<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:37.680> going<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:37.980> put<00:03:38.250> some<00:03:38.490> in

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
time and I'm just going to put some in

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.350 
time and I'm just going to put some in
the<00:03:38.790> corners<00:03:40.130> so<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.160> want<00:03:41.400> those<00:03:41.610> corners<00:03:42.180> to

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
the corners so I want those corners to

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.840 
the corners so I want those corners to
get<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:45.440> where<00:03:46.440> they<00:03:46.620> should<00:03:46.650> come<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
get on where they should come in the

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.720 
get on where they should come in the
center<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.710> just<00:03:49.710> want<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.920> be<00:03:50.010> careful<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.430> to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
center I just want to be careful not to

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.100 
center I just want to be careful not to
get<00:03:50.880> too<00:03:51.180> much<00:03:52.310> too<00:03:53.310> much<00:03:53.520> glue<00:03:55.730> everywhere

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
get too much too much glue everywhere

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.470 
get too much too much glue everywhere
because<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.590> do<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.280> try<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.880> keep<00:04:00.210> that

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
because you do want to try and keep that

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.470 
because you do want to try and keep that
back<00:04:00.780> fairly<00:04:01.410> neat<00:04:01.880> because<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:03.000> will<00:04:03.180> see

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
back fairly neat because you will see

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.570 
back fairly neat because you will see
whatever<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:04.050> open<00:04:04.440> at<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.710> back<00:04:04.860> there<00:04:05.220> on

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
whatever is open at the back there on

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.470 
whatever is open at the back there on
your<00:04:05.700> card<00:04:06.620> right<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:07.980> as<00:04:08.190> I'm<00:04:08.520> left<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.940> do<00:04:09.150> now

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
your card right so as I'm left to do now

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.690 
your card right so as I'm left to do now
I<00:04:09.750> could<00:04:10.440> have<00:04:10.560> stamped<00:04:10.920> something<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.490> there

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
I could have stamped something on there

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.790 
I could have stamped something on there
which<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.090> thought<00:04:12.300> about<00:04:12.480> later<00:04:12.810> that's<00:04:13.590> what

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
which I thought about later that's what

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.620 
which I thought about later that's what
happens<00:04:14.130> when<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.460> make<00:04:14.580> these<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.210> cards

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
happens when you make these on cards

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.800 
happens when you make these on cards
that<00:04:15.840> evolve<00:04:17.210> but<00:04:18.210> I'll<00:04:18.330> come<00:04:18.510> back<00:04:18.600> with<00:04:18.750> some

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
that evolve but I'll come back with some

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.340 
that evolve but I'll come back with some
decorations<00:04:19.700> okay<00:04:20.729> I'm<00:04:20.970> back<00:04:21.330> after<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.900> fabric

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
decorations okay I'm back after a fabric

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.500 
decorations okay I'm back after a fabric
plane<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:23.250> is

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
plane this is

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.310 
plane this is
I've<00:04:23.660> come<00:04:23.870> up<00:04:24.020> with<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.470> didn't<00:04:24.980> want<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:27.140> to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
I've come up with I didn't want it to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.610 
I've come up with I didn't want it to
look<00:04:27.440> like<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.650> girlie<00:04:27.950> card<00:04:28.310> or<00:04:29.620> something

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
look like a girlie card or something

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.500 
look like a girlie card or something
like<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:30.890> you<00:04:31.250> know<00:04:31.370> with<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.580> flower<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:32.180> I

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
like that you know with the flower so I

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.120 
like that you know with the flower so I
decided<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.110> put<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.350> little<00:04:33.530> owl<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.920> here

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
decided to put the little owl on here

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.890 
decided to put the little owl on here
because<00:04:34.310> ours<00:04:34.670> go<00:04:34.880> we've<00:04:35.090> been<00:04:35.300> lies<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
because ours go we've been lies and

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.690 
because ours go we've been lies and
books<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.380> sort<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.650> thing<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.550> think

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
books and that sort of thing so I think

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.390 
books and that sort of thing so I think
that<00:04:37.970> worked<00:04:38.150> well<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:39.500> was<00:04:39.890> finding<00:04:40.280> it

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
that worked well and I was finding it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.100 
that worked well and I was finding it
really<00:04:40.610> hard<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:41.060> put<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.270> stamp<00:04:41.630> on<00:04:41.810> here<00:04:42.080> that

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
really hard to put a stamp on here that

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.740 
really hard to put a stamp on here that
was<00:04:42.830> applicable<00:04:43.100> but<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.640> found<00:04:43.880> life<00:04:44.270> happens

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
was applicable but I found life happens

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.380 
was applicable but I found life happens
love<00:04:45.260> helps<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.190> think<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.760> matches<00:04:47.360> it

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390
