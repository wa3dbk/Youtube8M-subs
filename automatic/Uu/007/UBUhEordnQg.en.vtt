sizes 157 164 171 and 178 these binding
this<00:00:43.230> skis<00:00:43.440> also<00:00:43.680> comes<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.280> bindings

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this skis also comes with these bindings

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.709 
this skis also comes with these bindings
on<00:00:44.879> them<00:00:45.030> they're<00:00:45.239> an<00:00:45.329> atomic<00:00:46.910> binding<00:00:47.910> three

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
on them they're an atomic binding three

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.529 
on them they're an atomic binding three
to<00:00:48.930> ten<00:00:49.200> din<00:00:49.610> you<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> these

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to ten din you can see that these

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.189 
to ten din you can see that these
bindings<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:53.190> course<00:00:53.460> pass<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.719> safety

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bindings of course pass all the safety

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.319 
bindings of course pass all the safety
tests<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> everything<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.329> they're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
tests and everything like that they're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.349 
tests and everything like that they're
fully<00:00:57.570> adjustable<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.670> adjust<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
fully adjustable so you can adjust and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
fully adjustable so you can adjust and
have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> local<00:01:01.530> shop<00:01:01.710> wherever<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> live

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
have a local shop wherever you live

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
adjust them up real quick for you this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
adjust them up real quick for you this
also<00:01:05.909> gives<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.600> wide<00:01:06.900> range<00:01:07.229> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
also gives them a pretty wide range of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
also gives them a pretty wide range of
ability<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.740> size<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> people<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.700> use

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
ability and size of people that can use

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.080 
ability and size of people that can use
them<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> some

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
them you can see here they have a some

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
them you can see here they have a some
little<00:01:12.450> dampening<00:01:13.439> strips<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.820> that's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
little dampening strips here and that's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.020 
little dampening strips here and that's
so<00:01:18.180> when<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> turn<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:20.520> reduces

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so when you get into a turn it reduces

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.749 
so when you get into a turn it reduces
the<00:01:21.150> chatter<00:01:21.890> when<00:01:22.890> you're<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> hard

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the chatter when you're on on a hard

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
the chatter when you're on on a hard
snow<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.810> definitely<00:01:25.200> considered<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
