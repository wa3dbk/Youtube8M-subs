00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.830 

I<00:00:05.550> think<00:00:06.550> you<00:00:06.729> can<00:00:06.910> apply<00:00:07.090> a<00:00:07.210> lot<00:00:07.479> of<00:00:07.540> what<00:00:07.750> you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:07.840 
I think you can apply a lot of what you

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.140 
I think you can apply a lot of what you
learn<00:00:08.019> or<00:00:08.320> what<00:00:08.980> you<00:00:09.100> learn<00:00:09.280> racing<00:00:09.700> something

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
learn or what you learn racing something

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.200 
learn or what you learn racing something
to<00:00:10.809> any<00:00:11.320> other<00:00:11.550> category<00:00:12.550> of<00:00:12.670> racing<00:00:13.000> that<00:00:13.090> you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
to any other category of racing that you

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.530 
to any other category of racing that you
moved<00:00:13.420> to<00:00:14.340> especially<00:00:15.340> considering<00:00:15.969> that<00:00:16.000> the

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
moved to especially considering that the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.990 
moved to especially considering that the
quarter<00:00:16.810> midgets<00:00:17.110> are<00:00:17.290> pretty<00:00:18.099> similar<00:00:18.670> in

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
quarter midgets are pretty similar in

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.929 
quarter midgets are pretty similar in
the<00:00:19.470> configuration<00:00:20.470> that<00:00:20.650> they<00:00:20.859> race<00:00:21.100> to<00:00:21.910> a

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
the configuration that they race to a

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.179 
the configuration that they race to a
sprint<00:00:22.330> car<00:00:22.390> you<00:00:23.230> get<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.500> learn<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.680> lot<00:00:23.890> of<00:00:24.070> the

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
sprint car you get to learn a lot of the

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.460 
sprint car you get to learn a lot of the
basic<00:00:24.609> things<00:00:24.910> at<00:00:25.510> a<00:00:25.600> very<00:00:25.810> young<00:00:25.990> age<00:00:26.050> in

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
basic things at a very young age in

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.170 
basic things at a very young age in
quarter<00:00:26.740> midgets<00:00:27.070> that<00:00:27.609> I've<00:00:27.730> been<00:00:27.849> able<00:00:28.090> to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
quarter midgets that I've been able to

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.060 
quarter midgets that I've been able to
apply<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.570> both<00:00:28.810> my<00:00:28.990> micro<00:00:29.349> racing<00:00:29.769> and<00:00:29.890> my

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
apply to both my micro racing and my

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.939 
apply to both my micro racing and my
sprint<00:00:30.490> cars<00:00:30.699> so<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:31.990> far<00:00:32.230> I<00:00:32.290> say<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.800> the

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
sprint cars so so far I say that the

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.439 
sprint cars so so far I say that the
quarter<00:00:33.489> mates<00:00:33.670> who<00:00:33.820> were<00:00:33.850> such<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.150> great

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
quarter mates who were such a great

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.990 
quarter mates who were such a great
training<00:00:34.809> tool<00:00:34.989> and<00:00:35.440> they<00:00:36.400> really<00:00:36.699> helped<00:00:36.909> me

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
training tool and they really helped me

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.770 
training tool and they really helped me
a<00:00:37.030> lot

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.520 

well

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
well

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.920 
well
many<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:46.399> many<00:00:46.550> years<00:00:46.820> I<00:00:47.000> went<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.510> races

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
many for many years I went to the races

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.250 
many for many years I went to the races
as<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.920> fan<00:00:49.250> watching<00:00:49.520> him<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.660> definitely

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
as a fan watching him so I definitely

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.920 
as a fan watching him so I definitely
learned<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:52.039> lot<00:00:52.160> about<00:00:52.399> just<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.360> whole<00:00:53.540> sport

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
learned a lot about just the whole sport

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.290 
learned a lot about just the whole sport
in<00:00:54.079> general<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.649> was<00:00:55.129> really<00:00:55.430> too<00:00:55.640> young<00:00:55.670> to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
in general I was really too young to

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.840 
in general I was really too young to
take<00:00:57.050> anything<00:00:57.379> away<00:00:57.649> from<00:00:57.800> learning<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> whole

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
take anything away from learning a whole

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.310 
take anything away from learning a whole
lot<00:00:59.059> about<00:00:59.180> other<00:00:59.600> than<00:00:59.780> just<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.079> fan

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
lot about other than just a fan

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.399 
lot about other than just a fan
perspective<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:02.030> certainly<00:01:02.540> served<00:01:03.229> as<00:01:03.379> a

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
perspective but it certainly served as a

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.800 
perspective but it certainly served as a
good<00:01:03.620> background<00:01:03.829> for<00:01:04.190> me<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.720> help<00:01:05.720> me

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
good background for me to help me

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.230 
good background for me to help me
advance<00:01:05.960> along<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.800> raise<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.820> spring<00:01:08.060> car

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
advance along and raise the spring car

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.130 
advance along and raise the spring car
now<00:01:09.310> it's<00:01:10.310> kind<00:01:10.549> of<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.759> neat<00:01:11.240> experience<00:01:11.990> to

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
now it's kind of a neat experience to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.499 
now it's kind of a neat experience to
race<00:01:12.860> against<00:01:13.130> people<00:01:13.549> that<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:14.360> always

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
race against people that you always

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.080 
race against people that you always
looked<00:01:14.869> up<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.440> watched<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.100> racing<00:01:16.580> and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
looked up to and watched and racing and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.820 
looked up to and watched and racing and
along<00:01:17.420> with<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.840> fact<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:18.410> he<00:01:18.590> raced

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
along with the fact that he raced

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.070 
along with the fact that he raced
against<00:01:19.220> them<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:19.880> he's<00:01:20.060> always<00:01:20.240> able<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.630> shed

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
against them so he's always able to shed

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.649 
against them so he's always able to shed
a<00:01:21.110> little<00:01:21.229> light<00:01:21.410> into<00:01:21.910> maybe<00:01:22.910> a<00:01:23.030> few<00:01:23.509> things

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
a little light into maybe a few things

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.529 
a little light into maybe a few things
about<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:24.320> might<00:01:24.500> help<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.860> beat<00:01:25.429> them<00:01:25.610> but

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
about it might help you beat them but

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.200 
about it might help you beat them but
it's<00:01:27.170> kind<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.710> cool<00:01:28.159> thing<00:01:28.190> whenever<00:01:29.000> I

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's kind of a cool thing whenever I

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.330 
it's kind of a cool thing whenever I
used<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.600> be<00:01:29.720> walking<00:01:29.929> through<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.319> pits<00:01:30.590> when

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
used to be walking through the pits when

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.160 
used to be walking through the pits when
I<00:01:31.399> was<00:01:31.520> about<00:01:31.640> five<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.330> used<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.600> talk<00:01:32.990> to

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
I was about five and I used to talk to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.350 
I was about five and I used to talk to
people<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.619> now<00:01:33.740> I'm<00:01:33.950> competing<00:01:34.880> against

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
people and now I'm competing against

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.290 
people and now I'm competing against
them<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:35.690> it's<00:01:36.460> definitely<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.550> lot<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.729> fun<00:01:38.030> and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
them so it's definitely a lot of fun and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.609 
them so it's definitely a lot of fun and
I'm<00:01:38.420> just<00:01:38.450> very<00:01:38.810> fortunate<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.409> have<00:01:39.440> the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
I'm just very fortunate to have the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.740 
I'm just very fortunate to have the
opportunity<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.220> do<00:01:40.429> it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.030 

I<00:01:47.310> originally<00:01:48.310> met<00:01:48.760> them<00:01:48.970> through<00:01:49.240> my<00:01:49.360> dad<00:01:50.040> so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
I originally met them through my dad so

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.070 
I originally met them through my dad so
the<00:01:51.940> four<00:01:52.420> years<00:01:52.720> they<00:01:52.960> spent<00:01:53.490> racing

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
the four years they spent racing

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.650 
the four years they spent racing
together<00:01:56.080> themselves<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:58.060> spilled<00:01:58.510> over

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
together themselves then spilled over

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.200 
together themselves then spilled over
there<00:01:58.930> was<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.080> year<00:01:59.260> off<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.770> between<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.550> then

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
there was a year off in between and then

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.260 
there was a year off in between and then
they<00:02:01.570> were<00:02:02.400> not<00:02:03.400> currently<00:02:03.760> racing<00:02:04.000> with

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
they were not currently racing with

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.420 
they were not currently racing with
anybody<00:02:04.630> else<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.680> was<00:02:05.830> looking<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.250> move

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
anybody else and I was looking to move

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.190 
anybody else and I was looking to move
up<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.880> micros<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.690> kind<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:07.990> seemed

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
up to the micros and this kind of seemed

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.449 
up to the micros and this kind of seemed
something<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.740> something<00:02:09.039> they<00:02:09.250> would<00:02:09.280> be

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
something like something they would be

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.240 
something like something they would be

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
amount of determination he has we

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.580 
amount of determination he has we
continued<00:02:45.280> doing<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.720> not<00:02:46.720> getting<00:02:47.110> tired<00:02:47.350> or

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
continued doing it not getting tired or

burnt<00:02:47.800> out<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.280> after<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.670> few<00:02:48.970> years<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
burnt out of it after a few years the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.830 
burnt out of it after a few years the
way<00:02:50.410> he<00:02:50.560> continues<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.130> do<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.569> older

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
way he continues to do it and the older

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.559 
way he continues to do it and the older
he<00:02:52.930> gets<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.350> better<00:02:53.530> he<00:02:53.739> gets<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:55.150> if

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
he gets the better he gets so just if

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.210 
he gets the better he gets so just if
you<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.989> take<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.410> thing<00:02:56.560> away<00:02:56.620> from<00:02:57.010> him

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
you have to take one thing away from him

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.190 
you have to take one thing away from him
that<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.970> want<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.269> model<00:02:58.660> yourself<00:02:58.750> after

that you want to model yourself after

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800 
that you want to model yourself after
that's<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.519> stay<00:03:00.700> focused<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.420> be
