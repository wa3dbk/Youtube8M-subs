00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.399
 hey with friends youtube guitarists 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.200
 today I think to play this song the 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.070
 artist chris tyler because a song 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.750
 very easy and above all pretty 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.750
 I want to grow also the support that we 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.490
 they are giving through youtube to 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.449
 share the videos and subscribe and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.930
 thank you very much for that 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.180
 and good is rewarding doing the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.680
 requests that are asking us in the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.420
 comments 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.230

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.980
 greetings this site that is in my town 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 Greetings to all the other friends that we 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.910
 they are seeing is that we are going to use 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.910
 with the tutorial quickly 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 good to start we will use a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.720
 capo on the first fret if you do not have a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.420
 capo fret do not get discouraged here 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.860
 description is to leave a link of a video 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.070
 to check how they can make a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 very easy contrast 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.250
 good morning to the teeth chords all 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 and this fabio this 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.100
 the intro in this way 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.100
 Y 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.490
 as they saw we left everything and we are going to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 scrape down up and with others 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.270
 riders and we're going to put this note here in 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.159
 sun on the first string in the third 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.289
 fret splitting the first cap 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.289
 it's like we basically do everything 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.299
 ok very simple but the accommodations 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 as well 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.939
 same inmate all 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.320
 and we start with the verse part 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.550
 we can the next to cut the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.510
 various titles 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.510
 I'm dying 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.450
 fa 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.319
 whole 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.800
 A minor 'call you does not exist 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.180
 we have these 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.180
 and they will become orders 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.680
 and we went to the part of the pre chorus that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.770
 they are almost the same chords we make a 2 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.380
 but we do it with under the sun here like this 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.069
 if you do not want to do the basses you can 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.069
 leave 2 normal 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.880
 forever 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.880
 and also after I have 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.910
 they are basically the same as we put 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:19.900
 a low sun 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.900
 and here we do this but right away 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.770
 and let's move on to the choir part 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.770
 two 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.770
 we make the girlie 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.659
 our 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.520
 repeat again 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.459
 and once again the chorus ends 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.459
 with the verse that are the same chords 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.400
 that in the verse afterwards the same 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.349
 chords in the pre chorus and would lack a 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.430
 part that is like an interest where 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.430
 Fifth chords are used 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.209
 It's the funk 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.459
 look 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.459
 i love you 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.920
 we make a minor to be able to live 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.230
 we make a sun 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:39.610
 then the ones that go down we're going 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:44.540
 to do they are suspended 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.800
 2 of that part we would stay like this 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.800
 and in me 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.830
 flips 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.789
 to be able to live 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.040
 to serve 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.350
 more than note 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.770
 yes 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.090
 because in spite of me 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.090
 and nothing 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.639
 and its themes 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.180
 issues and it goes back to repeating everything up 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.860
 get to the end of the song 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.320
 and as you can see it is a song that has already reached 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.300
 its end is very simple in general 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.030
 there are only four chords that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 they use for the whole song I hope it's 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.880
 understood and if they had any doubt 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.370
 anyone let me know either here 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.590
 down in the comments or our 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.070
 good social networks that would be all for 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.070
 this election 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.750
 goodbye 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.230
 the chrysler I hope you're seeing this 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.160
 video if not then it is not true only 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.130
 I wanted to tell you that you are a good artist 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.660
 and please please please 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:23.730

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.730
 Good, same, I promise goodbye.
