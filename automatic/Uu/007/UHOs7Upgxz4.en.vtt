saying
it's<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:10.740> it's<00:02:11.850> by<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.210> past<00:02:13.450> twelve<00:02:13.810> years

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
it's it's it's by the past twelve years

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.920 
it's it's it's by the past twelve years
of<00:02:14.110> grade<00:02:14.800> school<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.420> didn't<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:16.810> like

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
of grade school and I didn't really like

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.740 
of grade school and I didn't really like
school<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.860> hopefully<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.510> didn't

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
school and hopefully you know I didn't

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.480 
school and hopefully you know I didn't
really<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.890> know<00:02:20.950> having<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.310> wake

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
really like that you know having to wake

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.910 
really like that you know having to wake
up<00:02:21.700> around<00:02:21.910> seven<00:02:22.480> o'clock<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.380> seven

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
up around seven o'clock and then seven

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.480 
up around seven o'clock and then seven
to<00:02:24.480> seven<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.600> two<00:02:25.870> classes<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.950> all<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.250> I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
to seven to two classes and all that I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.130 
to seven to two classes and all that I
wasn't<00:02:27.880> really<00:02:27.970> too<00:02:28.180> big<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.540> fan<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.840> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
wasn't really too big of a fan of that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.880 
wasn't really too big of a fan of that
and<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:30.360> think<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.990> when<00:02:32.260> college<00:02:32.620> comes

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and I think that when college comes

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.350 
and I think that when college comes
around<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.430> you're<00:02:33.550> able<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.730> schedule<00:02:34.060> your

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
around and you're able to schedule your

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.930 
around and you're able to schedule your
classes<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.930> not<00:02:35.050> have<00:02:35.320> them<00:02:35.530> be<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.280> early<00:02:36.850> in

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
classes and not have them be so early in

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.780 
classes and not have them be so early in
the<00:02:37.060> morning<00:02:37.480> that's<00:02:37.690> gonna<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.470> nice

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the morning that's gonna be really nice

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.180 
the morning that's gonna be really nice
but<00:02:40.860> I'm<00:02:41.860> trying<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.220> think<00:02:42.460> though<00:02:44.190> it's

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
but I'm trying to think though it's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.000 
but I'm trying to think though it's
interesting<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.330> think<00:02:46.360> about<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.890> know

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
interesting to think about that you know

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.920 
interesting to think about that you know
the<00:02:48.130> fact<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.580> all<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.390> people<00:02:49.720> who<00:02:49.810> I've

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the fact that all the people who I've

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.620 
the fact that all the people who I've
been<00:02:50.290> with<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:51.460> my<00:02:51.580> classes<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.270> all<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
been with in my classes and all that and

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.900 
been with in my classes and all that and
all<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.780> people<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.170> my<00:02:53.200> grade<00:02:53.880> right<00:02:54.880> now

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
all the people in my grade right now

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.670 
all the people in my grade right now
well<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> end<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.900> school<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.170> tomorrow

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
well if the end of school is tomorrow

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.000 
well if the end of school is tomorrow
shut<00:02:57.190> up<00:02:57.220> fun<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.750> want<00:02:58.990> alright<00:02:59.770> well<00:02:59.920> the

shut up fun you want alright well the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.300 
shut up fun you want alright well the
end<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.220> class<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.550> tomorrow<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.320> then<00:03:02.500> after

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
end of class is tomorrow and then after

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.730 
end of class is tomorrow and then after
that<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.880> think<00:03:04.000> all<00:03:04.510> that's<00:03:04.720> left<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.590> have

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
that I think all that's left is we have

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.160 
that I think all that's left is we have
graduation<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.880> then<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.570> all-night<00:03:07.930> grad

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
graduation and then the all-night grad

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.550 
graduation and then the all-night grad
party<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.010> after<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.730> old<00:03:09.850> my<00:03:09.970> grad<00:03:10.210> party

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
party and after the old my grad party

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.130 
party and after the old my grad party
everyone<00:03:11.970> well<00:03:12.970> ninety<00:03:13.540> I'm<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:13.990> say<00:03:14.110> a

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
everyone well ninety I'm going to say a

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.660 
everyone well ninety I'm going to say a
good<00:03:14.380> ninety<00:03:14.740> five<00:03:14.920> percent<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.460> people

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
good ninety five percent of the people

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.820 
good ninety five percent of the people
I'm<00:03:16.060> excluding<00:03:17.020> just<00:03:17.200> seeing<00:03:17.380> them<00:03:17.530> around

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
I'm excluding just seeing them around

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.620 
I'm excluding just seeing them around
town<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.610> all<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:18.910> won't<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.300> seeing<00:03:19.540> him

town and all that I won't be seeing him
again<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.080> probably<00:03:20.290> won't<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:20.680> talking<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.130> him

again I probably won't be talking to him

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.060 
again I probably won't be talking to him
and<00:03:21.960> that's<00:03:22.960> kind<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.410> crazy<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.860> think<00:03:23.950> about

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
and that's kind of crazy to think about

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.530 
and that's kind of crazy to think about
it<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.430> know<00:03:24.520> but<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.850> think<00:03:24.970> that's<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.360> good

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
it you know but I think that's a good

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780 
it you know but I think that's a good
thing<00:03:25.720> because<00:03:25.870> being<00:03:26.080> stuck<00:03:26.620> with<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.550> same

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
thing because being stuck with the same

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.250 
thing because being stuck with the same
people<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.540> many<00:03:28.660> years<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.080> become

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
people for so many years to become

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.400 
people for so many years to become
stagnant<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.250> by<00:03:31.060> going<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.570> college<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.320> I'm

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
stagnant and by going to college and I'm

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.930 
stagnant and by going to college and I'm
actually<00:03:32.560> not<00:03:32.830> going<00:03:33.160> too<00:03:33.310> far<00:03:33.550> away<00:03:33.760> for
