00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.809
 of revenue 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 It's no longer enough for everything that we go through 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.730
 with games here in brazil the abusive price 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.019
 It is absurd that we now pay the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 Join our community now! 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.250

 brazil video game is facing the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.840
 launches although the average of 200 reais 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.700
 already tired of talking around here 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 imports of these securities presented 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.090
 problems between March and July 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.920
 games are stuck in the recipe 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.289
 federal leaving stores in games 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 produced the term used thought out 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.320
 from the country 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.789
 I need outside the country is what is in 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.039
 game is the interpretation of how they 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.690
 play with the houses in order to be defined 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.129
 tax burden on that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 product that is divergent between 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.479
 between the organs and the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 distributor is thus one of the taxes 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.869
 for the absurdity of money the other you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.340
 pay a theft scandal 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.360
 only these two tax options in the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540
 brazil for games 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.210
 there is the reason that the general inspection 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.340
 been initiated was not disclosed it was not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 revealed if you want to stick your hand 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 Brazilian money games already 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.549
 are an expensive nonsense but what if you do the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 who called me the fucking peace that the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.530
 people went because by agreement read 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.880
 according to the chief inspector of the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.159
 recipe province of curitiba 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.619
 federal claudia regina tomás may have 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.119
 been a denunciation or study 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.490
 submitted by the representative of the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.689
 denouncing the study makes the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 general management coordination 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.509
 increase your radar to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.399
 determine the problem and if you have 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.439
 placed the games on channel gray channel 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.119
 that I call this means that 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.920
 companies that imported games between 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.869
 March and April fell on this channel to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.719
 more thorough inspection 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.930
 kaká ie there was nothing illegal 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.000
 there was nothing 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.350
 it's underneath the cloths so people 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.510
 were therefore normally 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.300
 they were now fucking the federal revenue 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.860
 who only shit themselves are not 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.510
 If you understand what's going on there 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.010
 because complaint that he worked 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.340
 all import to all stores 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.840
 you report to a regional retailer 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.640
 and not one of them 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 do yourself a favor if you want to fool anyone 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.580
 play in my face that thinks I 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.380
 I have jj's face going to continue here. 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:43.910
 O difference in price 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:45.380
 imported games have 164% wariró games 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.060
 imported are one hundred and sixty-four 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.930
 per cent of taxes on the value of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 product 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.520
 this way the game would be 100 reais 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.840
 added the import duty of 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:01.750
 20 percent asked for and 65 with purposes of 7.60 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.330
 of São Paulo which is 25% ipi of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.860
 50% ends up being sold for two hundred and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.690
 sixty four reais 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.970
 in practice currently eggs sold by 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.150
 $ 60 in the United States for 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.390
 videogames is playstation 3 xbox are 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.260
 boys Brazil between 170 and 200 only 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.690
 people know right? 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.540
 that's why any doubt they 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.000
 are here fighting that networks 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.570
 retailers are fighting video game is 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.400
 considered toy is the game 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.440
 videogame considers the toy what 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.900
 has absurdity and wants it to be 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.660
 talk about software that has lower tax 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.790
 let's read in practice games currently 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.290
 sold for 60 canal was already if 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.720
 classified with the software when the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.209
 game comes to Brazil only collect the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.079
 same taxes for the media as the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.840
 tax burden reaches 78 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:58.370
 a 164% tax burden on another load 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.070
 taxable income separately are 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.480
 collected 17.65 on copyright 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.260
 income tax withheld in the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.090
 source 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.530
 the game's classification with the software is 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.540
 most suitable product in the understanding 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.780
 of the Brazilian association of 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.780
 software 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.709
 The point is this, it's all wrong, right? 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.120
 face gets software with the toy is 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.639
 a technical discussion 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.680
 Neither do we have what we 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.380
 have to argue even is because the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.540
 toy has a rate of this size and 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.960
 because the software also has the bizarre rate 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.010
 of this size is 72% for the sort of 164% 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.370
 after the toy how does that 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.350
 Dude, we gotta hear the word. 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.340
 you will all get organized that 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.660
 lives a fee in a way 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.449
 transparent from another already seen also 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.790
 games are billed as games of chance 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.889
 it is certain that the space rate also 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.990
 So what do we have to ask? 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.150
 here is no toy and a partner has to 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.220
 be the absurd rate of this and beyond 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.310
 to tax this nonsense besides stealing 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.930
 both so taxed so they are 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.580
 fighting the fucking game is the galera 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.949
 who will want to buy now and up to 50 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.380
 coming up O der great way is so 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.810
 arrive in 1999 so there will be day 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.360
 19 in stores as if you want to know 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.400
 talk is that I do not know but even the fifth was 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.010
 postponed from 17 and 19 may have already been 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.380
 preaching that it's shit I do not know but it 's 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.669
 a totally possible possibility, right? 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.650
 It's just that I just leave my 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.960
 indignation about this case 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.120
 bizarre that we see all the time 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.190
 here in brazil and then I only needed this 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.360
 idea of ​​taxing at absolutely high 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.830
 games in brazil they are now 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.750
 recently blocking 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.220
 download games here in Brazil such 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.860
 Any way you want in the store buy no 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.270
 You can do it because of this shit. 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.889
 some time I do not buy physical media 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.389
 I'm buying a lot of digital media. 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.550

 Sao Paulo and the paraná that was quite 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.039
 affected because of this then comments

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.620
 does that sort of thing you're doing 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.660
 again only impeding free trade 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.099
 hindering the free economy and only 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.099
 holding the development of that country 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.900
 clear that the government is 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.630
 doing all this time with these 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.120
 bizarre taxes that have no meaning 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.159
 from the reasons that the government 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.260
 having this southern door are ridiculous and the 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.090
