00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
industry ah so was it a small bump in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
industry ah so was it a small bump in
terms<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> specs<00:00:39.420> between<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> third<00:00:40.350> gen

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
terms of specs between the third gen

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
terms of specs between the third gen
ipad<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> 4th<00:00:41.550> gen<00:00:41.730> ipad<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.750> say

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
ipad and the 4th gen ipad i would say

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.190 
ipad and the 4th gen ipad i would say
yes<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.710> significant<00:00:44.520> bump<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.450> cpu

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
yes it was a significant bump the cpu

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
yes it was a significant bump the cpu
will<00:00:46.680> drive<00:00:46.950> twice<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> performance<00:00:47.579> twice

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
will drive twice the performance twice

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
will drive twice the performance twice
the<00:00:48.600> graphics<00:00:49.020> performance<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.649> boot<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the graphics performance to boot and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.880 
the graphics performance to boot and
that's<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> big<00:00:51.210> deal<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> ipad<00:00:52.680> on

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that's a big deal if you use the ipad on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
that's a big deal if you use the ipad on
a<00:00:52.920> regular<00:00:53.250> basis<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> gaming

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
a regular basis if this is a gaming

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.139 
a regular basis if this is a gaming
machine<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.230> even<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.620> productivity<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
machine or even for productivity the the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
machine or even for productivity the the
faster<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.719> machine<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.559> better<00:00:58.739> off<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
faster that machine the better off you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.279 
faster that machine the better off you
are<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.579> even<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> speed<00:01:00.750> increase

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
are but even with that speed increase

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
are but even with that speed increase
even<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.070> processor<00:01:02.699> bump<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.539> have

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
even with that processor bump they have

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
even with that processor bump they have
not<00:01:04.019> sacrificed<00:01:04.799> battery<00:01:05.280> life<00:01:05.430> they<00:01:05.610> also

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
not sacrificed battery life they also

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
not sacrificed battery life they also
improved<00:01:06.299> other<00:01:06.600> internals<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
improved other internals like the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.100 
improved other internals like the
cameras<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
cameras which is good for those of you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
cameras which is good for those of you
who<00:01:10.260> use<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.010> cameras<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> ipad<00:01:11.850> i<00:01:12.060> think

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
who use the cameras on the ipad i think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.730 
who use the cameras on the ipad i think
i've<00:01:12.420> only<00:01:12.540> used<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.840> once<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.110> twice<00:01:13.200> but

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
i've only used it once or twice but

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.820 
i've only used it once or twice but
specifically<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.460> facetime<00:01:14.850> conversations

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
specifically for facetime conversations

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.880

the<00:06:43.900> screen<00:06:44.110> is<00:06:44.140> too<00:06:44.380> large<00:06:44.500> for<00:06:44.620> your<00:06:44.920> needs<00:06:45.070> I

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
the screen is too large for your needs I

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.120 
the screen is too large for your needs I
that<00:06:46.720> some<00:06:47.050> people<00:06:47.350> believe<00:06:47.620> that<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:48.010> ipad

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
that some people believe that the ipad

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.120 
that some people believe that the ipad
screen<00:06:48.730> is<00:06:49.660> just<00:06:49.720> too<00:06:50.020> big<00:06:50.200> and<00:06:50.410> that's<00:06:50.650> fine<00:06:50.920> I

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
screen is just too big and that's fine I

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.380 
screen is just too big and that's fine I
mean<00:06:51.280> there<00:06:51.430> are<00:06:51.550> plenty<00:06:51.790> of<00:06:51.910> devices<00:06:52.360> that

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
mean there are plenty of devices that

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.510 
mean there are plenty of devices that
have<00:06:52.570> smaller<00:06:53.020> screens<00:06:53.830> out<00:06:54.010> there<00:06:54.280> for<00:06:54.490> you

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
have smaller screens out there for you

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.050 
have smaller screens out there for you
to<00:06:54.790> choose<00:06:55.450> uh<00:06:55.860> and<00:06:56.860> that's<00:06:57.010> a<00:06:57.100> valid<00:06:57.340> reason

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
to choose uh and that's a valid reason

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.260 
to choose uh and that's a valid reason
