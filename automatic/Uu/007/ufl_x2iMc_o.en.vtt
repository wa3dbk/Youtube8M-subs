price now the only way I could see as

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.609 
price now the only way I could see as

going<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.210> in<00:02:51.300> price<00:02:51.360> now<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.380> would<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.710> been

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
going up in price now it would have been

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.190 
going up in price now it would have been
a<00:02:53.040> big<00:02:53.460> difference<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.360> certain<00:02:54.960> player

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
a big difference if that certain player

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.840 
a big difference if that certain player
you're<00:02:55.440> holding<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.280> only<00:02:56.430> player<00:02:56.700> that's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
you're holding is the only player that's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.760 
you're holding is the only player that's
going<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:57.210> in<00:02:57.390> price<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.410> isn't<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
going up in price but that isn't the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.130 
going up in price but that isn't the
case<00:02:58.980> right<00:02:59.490> now<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> profit<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.870> you're

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
case right now so the profit that you're

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.440 
case right now so the profit that you're
making<00:03:01.260> isn't<00:03:01.890> exactly<00:03:02.400> profit<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.210> know

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
making isn't exactly profit if you know

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.120 
making isn't exactly profit if you know
what<00:03:03.600> I'm<00:03:03.690> talking<00:03:03.720> about<00:03:04.110> now<00:03:04.770> if<00:03:04.920> there's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
what I'm talking about now if there's

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
what I'm talking about now if there's
potentially<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> chance<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.300> your<00:03:06.570> player

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
potentially a chance of your player
