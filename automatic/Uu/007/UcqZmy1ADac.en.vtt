three new AC Delco plugs which are

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.839 
three new AC Delco plugs which are
supposedly<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.860> ones<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.160> want<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> six

point two so I just got to retest them

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.679 
point two so I just got to retest them
because<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.699> can't<00:00:20.910> remember<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.270> ones<00:00:21.539> are

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
because I can't remember which ones are

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.070 
because I can't remember which ones are
the<00:00:21.810> bad<00:00:21.960> ones<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.490> I'll<00:00:23.490> show<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.080> okay

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.660 
the bad ones and I'll show you that okay
so<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.380> first<00:00:25.560> thing<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.949> want<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.490> go

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so the first thing you want to do is go

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.970 
so the first thing you want to do is go
ahead<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.939> pull<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> wires<00:00:27.840> off<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
ahead and pull all the wires off of the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.080 
ahead and pull all the wires off of the
plugs<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:31.309> let's<00:00:32.309> see<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> find<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
plugs and let's see if I can find a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.020 
plugs and let's see if I can find a
place<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.540> set<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.050> where<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.380> actually

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
place to set this where it actually

00:00:35.030 --> 00:01:00.520 
place to set this where it actually
maintains<00:00:36.200> connection<00:00:55.760> one<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> these<00:00:57.000> Vista

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.049 

it's<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.160> heads<00:01:02.370> no<00:01:02.550> making<00:01:02.879> any

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it's right on your heads no making any

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.080 
it's right on your heads no making any
kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> connection<00:01:08.510> there<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.750> go

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
kind of connection there we go

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.070 
kind of connection there we go
okay<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.700> side<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.210> ground<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
okay so you have one side on ground and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.880 
okay so you have one side on ground and
then<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> touch<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.430> other<00:01:17.549> end<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> tip

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
then you touch the other end to the tip

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.760 
then you touch the other end to the tip
to<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.369> connector<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> globe<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to the connector on the globe and you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.149 
to the connector on the globe and you
get<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> reading<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> case<00:01:24.659> one

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
get a reading here in this case one

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
get a reading here in this case one
point<00:01:26.420> six<00:01:27.420> seven<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.780> one's<00:01:30.780> good<00:01:31.049> move

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
point six seven so that one's good move

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.170 
point six seven so that one's good move
on<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> next<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:38.030> nothing<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
on to the next one and nothing at the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.899 
on to the next one and nothing at the
moment<00:01:42.079> okay<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.680> one's<00:01:43.920> infinite

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
moment okay so that one's infinite

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
moment okay so that one's infinite
resistance<00:01:46.549> dead

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.750 

that<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> also<00:01:51.810> infinite<00:01:52.409> resistance

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.320 

that<00:01:56.760> one<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.300> good

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
that one is good

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.530 
that one is good
1.6<00:02:00.330> 1.5<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:02.400> I've<00:02:02.490> got<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:02.909> dead<00:02:03.150> ones<00:02:03.360> on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
1.6 1.5 so I've got two dead ones on

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.830 
1.6 1.5 so I've got two dead ones on

the threads are out just keep spinning
it<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:54.690> you'll<00:02:54.900> wear<00:02:55.260> off<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.739> know

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890

it's<00:02:59.880> not<00:03:00.060> totally<00:03:00.480> swollen<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.489> will

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
it's not totally swollen but and it will

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.960 
it's not totally swollen but and it will
eventually<00:03:02.850> come<00:03:03.329> out<00:03:04.400> anyways<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.730> side

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
eventually come out anyways on this side

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.850 
eventually come out anyways on this side
was<00:03:06.420> two<00:03:06.750> ends<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.950> were<00:03:09.079> bad<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.709> two

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
was two ends that were bad and the two

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.860 
was two ends that were bad and the two
middle<00:03:11.010> ones<00:03:11.160> were<00:03:11.400> good<00:03:11.579> so<00:03:11.870> complete

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
middle ones were good so complete

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.110 
middle ones were good so complete
opposite<00:03:13.230> at<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.530> other<00:03:13.650> side<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
opposite at the other side and the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.860 
opposite at the other side and the
backbone<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.630> still<00:03:15.870> bad<00:03:17.540> like<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.630> said<00:03:18.840> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
backbone is still bad like I said I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.000 
backbone is still bad like I said I
couldn't<00:03:19.110> afford<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:19.709> Villa<00:03:19.950> plugs<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
couldn't afford for Villa plugs so but I

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.530 
couldn't afford for Villa plugs so but I
need<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.489> thing<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.820> start<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.150> little<00:03:24.329> bit

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
need this thing to start a little bit

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.530 
need this thing to start a little bit
easier<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.230> it's<00:03:26.100> only<00:03:26.220> about<00:03:26.400> 25<00:03:26.970> degrees<00:03:27.150> out

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
easier so it's only about 25 degrees out

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.270 
easier so it's only about 25 degrees out
in<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> morning<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.260> I'm<00:03:28.590> kind<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:28.890> surprised

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
in the morning and I'm kind of surprised

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
in the morning and I'm kind of surprised
it<00:03:29.489> was<00:03:29.640> starting<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.360> four<00:03:30.570> gold<00:03:30.810> looks

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
it was starting on just four gold looks

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.890 
it was starting on just four gold looks
at<00:03:31.260> all<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.670> do<00:03:32.880> need<00:03:33.120> an<00:03:33.299> ohmmeter

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
at all and you do need an ohmmeter

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.020 
at all and you do need an ohmmeter
not<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> light<00:03:34.560> or<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.600> sound<00:03:36.600> because<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:38.489> will

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
not a light or a sound because it will

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.600 
not a light or a sound because it will
there<00:03:39.750> are<00:03:39.930> such<00:03:40.500> thing<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:40.920> in-between<00:03:41.459> glow

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
there are such thing as in-between glow

there are such thing as in-between glow
plugs<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.390> said<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.690> other<00:03:42.810> day<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.350> I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
plugs like I said the other day when I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.190 
plugs like I said the other day when I
tested<00:03:43.829> these<00:03:44.269> one<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.540> side<00:03:45.600> actually

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
tested these one on that side actually

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.490 
tested these one on that side actually
read<00:03:46.560> 150<00:03:47.489> ohms<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.660> wasn't<00:03:48.959> quite<00:03:49.230> dead

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
read 150 ohms so it wasn't quite dead

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.270 
read 150 ohms so it wasn't quite dead
yet<00:03:49.859> but<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.190> was<00:03:50.310> certainly<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.209> its<00:03:51.359> way<00:03:51.540> out

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
yet but it was certainly on its way out

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.420 
yet but it was certainly on its way out
and<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:54.299> test<00:03:54.570> light<00:03:54.810> would<00:03:55.200> have<00:03:55.320> came<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.769> or<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
and a test light would have came on or a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.330 
and a test light would have came on or a
buzzer<00:03:56.850> would<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.209> sounded<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:59.160> would

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
buzzer would have sounded so you would

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.580 
buzzer would have sounded so you would
have<00:03:59.400> never<00:03:59.640> known<00:03:59.879> that<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.180> was

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
have never known that it was

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.350 
have never known that it was
going<00:04:01.010> bad<00:04:02.200> alrighty<00:04:03.760> there<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:04.879> go

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
going bad alrighty there you go

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.330 
going bad alrighty there you go
I'll<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:06.440> cold<00:04:06.739> start<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.310> tomorrow

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
I'll do a cold start on it tomorrow

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.930 
I'll do a cold start on it tomorrow
we'll<00:04:07.940> see<00:04:08.150> how<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.480> does<00:04:09.200> with<00:04:09.790> three<00:04:10.790> new

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
we'll see how it does with three new

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.449 
we'll see how it does with three new
glow<00:04:11.120> plugs<00:04:11.420> other<00:04:11.780> than<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:12.230> now<00:04:13.099> I<00:04:13.129> got<00:04:13.340> my

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
glow plugs other than that now I got my

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.880 
glow plugs other than that now I got my
-<00:04:13.700> off<00:04:14.000> like<00:04:14.269> Korver<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> while<00:04:14.930> because<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.500> put

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
- off like Korver a while because I put

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.800 
- off like Korver a while because I put
in<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.160> stereo<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:16.850> still<00:04:17.120> got<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.359> cut<00:04:17.570> a

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
in a stereo and I still got to cut a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.219 
in a stereo and I still got to cut a
hole<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.680> fit<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.630> -<00:04:20.870> cover

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
hole to fit it in the in the - cover

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.020 
hole to fit it in the in the - cover
there<00:04:23.860> know<00:04:24.860> what<00:04:24.979> I<00:04:25.040> want<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.460> do<00:04:25.580> I'm<00:04:25.880> going

there know what I want to do I'm going
to<00:04:26.090> try<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.330> get<00:04:26.540> my<00:04:26.720> oil<00:04:27.610> pressure<00:04:28.610> gauge<00:04:28.760> to

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
to try to get my oil pressure gauge to

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.090 
to try to get my oil pressure gauge to
work<00:04:29.330> it's<00:04:29.600> ascending<00:04:30.229> in<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.470> anyways<00:04:30.830> other

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
work it's ascending in it anyways other

than that see there
I<00:04:34.090> haven't<00:04:35.090> installed<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.110> CB<00:04:36.530> antenna<00:04:36.830> mount

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
I haven't installed the CB antenna mount

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.550 
I haven't installed the CB antenna mount
the<00:04:37.970> antennas<00:04:38.450> back<00:04:38.660> there<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.229> to<00:04:39.350> take

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
the antennas back there I have to take

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.280 
the antennas back there I have to take
off<00:04:39.830> because<00:04:40.600> otherwise<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.840> wouldn't<00:04:42.050> fit<00:04:42.139> in

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
off because otherwise it wouldn't fit in

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.260 
off because otherwise it wouldn't fit in

hub<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.810> was<00:04:47.960> being<00:04:48.229> all<00:04:48.380> sticky<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.280> that's

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
hub that was being all sticky and that's

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.280 
hub that was being all sticky and that's
got<00:04:49.880> dirt<00:04:50.060> in<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.360> because<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.630> just<00:04:50.660> drove<00:04:51.080> it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
got dirt in it because I just drove it

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.140 
got dirt in it because I just drove it
without<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.740> freaking<00:04:52.400> crap<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:53.000> there

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
without the freaking crap in there

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.550 
without the freaking crap in there
because<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.479> won't<00:04:53.630> go<00:04:53.780> back<00:04:53.990> together<00:04:54.169> now

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
because it won't go back together now

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
of those and it just doesn't really seem

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.430
