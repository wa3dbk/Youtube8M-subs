condensers<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:51.409> on<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.890> top<00:02:52.069> left<00:02:52.310> slot

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
condensers you know on the top left slot

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.280 
condensers you know on the top left slot
is<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.969> item<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.329> want<00:02:53.359> to<00:02:53.569> make<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.109> top

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
is the item you want to make and the top

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.190 
is the item you want to make and the top
right<00:02:54.500> slot<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.950> your<00:02:55.790> tome<00:02:56.030> you're<00:02:56.750> going<00:02:57.049> to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
right slot is your tome you're going to

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.190 
right slot is your tome you're going to
need<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.700> learn<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.030> items<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.510> ordinance<00:03:00.019> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
need to learn the items in ordinance and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.149 
need to learn the items in ordinance and
is<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.409> works<00:03:00.530> similar<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.069> the

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
is it works similar to the

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.710 
is it works similar to the
transportation<00:03:01.519> tablet<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.989> OOP<00:03:03.379> OOP<00:03:04.720> and

transportation tablet so OOP OOP and
they<00:03:05.900> you'll<00:03:06.170> see<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:07.069> Taman<00:03:07.879> they're

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
they you'll see the Taman they're

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.720 
they you'll see the Taman they're
totally<00:03:08.390> didn't<00:03:08.629> copy<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.989> from<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
totally didn't copy that from the

from the top you can insert the items
you're<00:03:41.370> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.050> condense<00:03:43.050> up<00:03:43.410> from<00:03:43.739> the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
you're going to condense up from the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.280 
you're going to condense up from the
sides<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.370> output<00:03:45.000> from<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.209> bottom<00:03:45.510> so

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
sides and the output from the bottom so

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.850 
sides and the output from the bottom so
I<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> chest<00:03:47.340> full<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:48.650> alternative<00:03:49.650> fuel

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
I have a chest full of alternative fuel

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.430 
I have a chest full of alternative fuel
and<00:03:50.069> it's<00:03:50.250> going<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.400> make<00:03:50.489> TNT<00:03:51.860> up<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
and it's going to make TNT up there and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.930 
and it's going to make TNT up there and
boom<00:03:55.440> oh<00:03:55.819> I<00:03:56.819> mean<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> mistake<00:03:58.080> hold<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.730> go<00:03:59.730> I

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
boom oh I mean a mistake hold on I go I

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.500 
boom oh I mean a mistake hold on I go I
didn't<00:04:00.540> learn<00:04:00.630> tnt<00:04:00.840> probably<00:04:01.830> do<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.510> there

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
didn't learn tnt probably do that there

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.970 
didn't learn tnt probably do that there
you<00:04:03.599> go<00:04:04.160> yeah<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.519> just<00:04:05.880> ice<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:07.620> mix<00:04:07.860> a

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
you go yeah it just ice just mix a

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.800 
you go yeah it just ice just mix a
little<00:04:08.099> bit<00:04:08.280> automation<00:04:08.849> right<00:04:09.209> here<00:04:09.450> we're

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
little bit automation right here we're

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.870 
little bit automation right here we're
going<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.170> make<00:04:10.349> diamonds<00:04:10.650> using<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:11.430> block

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
going to make diamonds using some block

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.789 
going to make diamonds using some block
of<00:04:12.000> alternate<00:04:12.360> fuel<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:13.380> put<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> hopper

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
of alternate fuel to put a hopper

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.030 
of alternate fuel to put a hopper
beneath<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.400> boom<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:16.169> will<00:04:16.500> start

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
beneath and boom it will start

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.150 
beneath and boom it will start
outputting<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.729> dimes<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.180> creates

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.220 

it<00:04:21.610> usually<00:04:21.910> produces<00:04:22.450> a<00:04:22.510> lot<00:04:22.750> faster<00:04:22.930> than

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
it usually produces a lot faster than

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.840 
it usually produces a lot faster than
the<00:04:23.350> output<00:04:23.770> with<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.190> copper<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:24.730> you

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
the output with the copper so you

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.880 
the output with the copper so you
probably<00:04:25.030> want<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.270> want<00:04:25.420> another<00:04:25.750> mondi

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.930 

sucks<00:04:29.890> out<00:04:30.040> items<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.430> lot<00:04:30.520> faster<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:32.340> oh<00:04:33.340> I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
sucks out items a lot faster and oh I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.839 
sucks out items a lot faster and oh I
almost<00:04:34.600> forgot

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
almost forgot

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.529 
almost forgot

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
will consume indefinitely so they just

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.639 
will consume indefinitely so they just
