have to go away and read and think about

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.170 
have to go away and read and think about
immediately<00:00:38.040> everyone<00:00:38.400> has<00:00:38.519> a<00:00:38.550> response<00:00:38.940> to

immediately everyone has a response to
it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.110 
it
darkly<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.010> first<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.910> first

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
darkly the first thing I think we first

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.549 
darkly the first thing I think we first
started<00:00:42.510> talking<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.080> it's<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
started talking about was it's kind of

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.770 
started talking about was it's kind of
contemporary<00:00:43.949> relevance<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:45.030> our<00:00:45.210> society

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
contemporary relevance in our society

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
contemporary relevance in our society
and<00:00:46.320> particularly<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> Fritzl<00:00:47.670> story<00:00:47.970> from

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and particularly the Fritzl story from

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.350 
and particularly the Fritzl story from
Austria<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.839> and<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.619> horrible<00:00:50.360> story

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
Austria and and that that horrible story

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
Austria and and that that horrible story
that<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.839> almost<00:00:52.049> incomprehensible<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that was almost incomprehensible that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
that was almost incomprehensible that
kind<00:00:53.519> of<00:00:53.549> but<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.089> know<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.479> can't<00:00:54.720> quite

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
kind of but you know you can't quite

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.439 
kind of but you know you can't quite
believe<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.739> could<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.010> happened<00:00:56.449> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
believe that that could have happened in

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.079 
believe that that could have happened in
our<00:00:57.600> world<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.409> I<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.220> it's<00:00:59.369> that<00:00:59.699> that

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
our world and I think it's that that

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.090 
our world and I think it's that that
allowed<00:01:00.540> us<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.960> find<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> key

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
allowed us to find a kind of key

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
allowed us to find a kind of key
Holloway<00:01:02.580> in<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.659> meant<00:01:03.869> that<00:01:03.930> we

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
Holloway in that meant that we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.830 
Holloway in that meant that we
understood<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.189> story<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.760> us<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
understood the story to us so I think

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.450 
understood the story to us so I think
what<00:01:10.080> we've<00:01:10.229> created<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.799> Hansel<00:01:11.100> Gretel

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
what we've created in Hansel Gretel

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
what we've created in Hansel Gretel
is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> contemporary<00:01:12.479> telling<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.740> very

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
is a contemporary telling that's very

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
is a contemporary telling that's very
dark<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.119> places<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.049> also<00:01:16.259> quite<00:01:16.590> humorous

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
dark in places but also quite humorous

audience point of view we will be

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
audience point of view we will be
showing<00:02:06.210> something<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.080> very<00:02:07.320> immersive

Bri so I'm trying to use every part of

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.370 
Bri so I'm trying to use every part of
the<00:02:45.190> limb<00:02:45.340> Bri<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:46.120> create<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.480> vastness<00:02:46.990> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
the limb Bri to create that vastness and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.950 
the limb Bri to create that vastness and
elongation<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.340> scale<00:02:48.610> it's<00:02:49.510> very<00:02:49.780> much

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
elongation of scale it's very much

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.170 
elongation of scale it's very much
informed<00:02:50.350> by<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.740> liberal<00:02:51.100> architecture<00:02:51.790> so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
informed by the liberal architecture so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.730 
informed by the liberal architecture so
I've<00:02:52.330> created<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.810> kind<00:02:52.990> of<00:02:53.080> upper<00:02:53.320> mezzanine

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
I've created a kind of upper mezzanine

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.010 
I've created a kind of upper mezzanine
level<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.340> I've<00:02:55.030> even<00:02:55.180> used<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.600> cupboard

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
level and I've even used the cupboard

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.710 
level and I've even used the cupboard
which<00:02:56.890> normally<00:02:57.250> stores<00:02:57.580> chairs<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.390> has<00:02:58.570> no

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
which normally stores chairs and has no

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.020 
which normally stores chairs and has no
access<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.710> we've<00:03:00.370> addressed<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
access to it so we've addressed the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.940 
access to it so we've addressed the
cupboard<00:03:01.330> as<00:03:01.450> Gretel's<00:03:01.840> bedroom<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.500> that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
cupboard as Gretel's bedroom and that

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.310 
cupboard as Gretel's bedroom and that
leads<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.460> into<00:03:03.730> Hansel's<00:03:04.090> bedroom<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:05.080> is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
leads out into Hansel's bedroom that is

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.550 
leads out into Hansel's bedroom that is
using<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.250> good<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.970> know<00:03:07.090> twelve<00:03:07.420> foot<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:08.110> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
using a good you know twelve foot of the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.770 
using a good you know twelve foot of the
audience<00:03:09.130> gallery<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:09.850> when<00:03:10.000> they<00:03:10.150> walk<00:03:10.510> into

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
audience gallery so when they walk into

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.120 
audience gallery so when they walk into
the<00:03:11.020> space<00:03:11.140> they<00:03:11.530> will<00:03:11.620> actually<00:03:11.770> get<00:03:12.100> a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
the space they will actually get a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.770 
the space they will actually get a
chance<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.490> walk<00:03:12.640> through<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.180> bedroom<00:03:13.300> as

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
chance to walk through the bedroom as

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.200 
chance to walk through the bedroom as
though<00:03:14.350> they're<00:03:14.530> exploring<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.130> space<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:16.060> I

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
though they're exploring the space and I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.300 
though they're exploring the space and I
think<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.510> helps<00:03:16.840> draw<00:03:17.200> audiences<00:03:17.860> into<00:03:18.280> a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
think that helps draw audiences into a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.920 
think that helps draw audiences into a
space<00:03:18.670> then<00:03:19.450> I've<00:03:19.600> created<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.550> stairway<00:03:21.550> down

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
space then I've created a stairway down

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.900 
space then I've created a stairway down
from<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.140> upper<00:03:23.350> mezzanine<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.700> leads

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
from that upper mezzanine and that leads

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.240 
from that upper mezzanine and that leads
to<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> livingroom<00:03:25.450> area<00:03:25.750> with<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> lower<00:03:26.830> low

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
to a livingroom area with a lower low

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.670 
to a livingroom area with a lower low
slightly<00:03:27.580> lowered<00:03:27.880> kitchen<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.410> kind

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
slightly lowered kitchen and it's a kind

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680 
slightly lowered kitchen and it's a kind
of<00:03:29.740> deconstructed<00:03:30.610> version<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.150> house

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
of deconstructed version of a house

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.750 
of deconstructed version of a house
I<00:03:31.720> suppose<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.440> it's<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.190> sense<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.610> the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
I suppose so it's that sense of the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.460 
I suppose so it's that sense of the
house<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.209> fragmented<00:03:34.660> like<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.080> family<00:03:35.380> are

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
house is fragmented like the family are

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.800 
house is fragmented like the family are
fragmented
