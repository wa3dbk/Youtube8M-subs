 we have 180 grit sandpaper blocks 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.090
 with the help of jose we are going to 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.000
 explain how you can do to paint 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.659
 your walls of your houses 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.640
 First of all we will protect baseboards 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.060
 windows and plugs with tape 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.659
 body-builder 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.610
 once this process is done 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 we will begin to remove with the spatula the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.659
 imperfections of the wall roughness 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.659
 so please josÃ© 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.290
 after having given a first hand 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.269
 of primer as I have explained 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.100
 diluted a part of primer by 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.590
 three parts of water 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.290
 we will apply the first hand of the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.340
 paint the desired color always 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.000
 diluting the 30% with water 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 please, jose 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.130
 with the first hand we will always try 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.470
 cover the wall to the maximum 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.470
 so I do not have to give many more hands 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.290
 once six or eight hours have passed 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.220
 from our application that is well 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.930
 dry the wall we will proceed to fix 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:02.320
 possible bumps and small cracks 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.720
 with water putty plast good we have two 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.510
 water putty types plast we have a 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.120
 putty that comes to us and that is a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.490
 putty to use and then we have the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.430
 putty powder that is a putty that 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.440
 we will do it to our liking 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.620
 said putty can not be too thick 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.100
 not very clear it has to be easy 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.100
 application 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.150
 the next step that we will take once 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.209
 more and it fixed and fixed the imperfections 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.640
 will give you a sandpaper to give us 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.769
 everything is very smooth and then we do not know 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.709
 note in the irregularities of the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.590
 putty still sanding so that we 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.450
 be smooth smooth good I wanted to explain you 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 that we have different sanding grains 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.580
 If the number is higher, the grain is more 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.060
 fine this for example is 180 and if the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.000
 number is lower the grain is wider 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.420
 The recommended sandpaper for this job is 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.849
 sandpaper 180 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.120
 I think that's fine that's how it was 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.459
 next step that we are going to give 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.739
 is to remove the dust well removed both 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.010
 with a broom with a cloth with what 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.109
 let's have more important hand to 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.470
 be able to have a good grip of the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.240
 paint have nothing nothing dust a 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.350
 once removed the dust when we already have 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.229
 the clean surface we will apply the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.169
 second coat of plastic paint 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:39.280
 color that we have chosen is 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:43.919
 important that we have a good wall 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.919
 peinadito because this is the final hand 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.349
 well after having given the second 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.779
 hand paint and once dry we 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.240
 have gone from 6 to 8 hours 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.789
 we will proceed to remove the tape from 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.529
 skirting boards and then we can hang on 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.199
 our pictures make our 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:07.620
 decoration and so on you have to remember 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.529
 whenever you have to wait about 15 days 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.629
 to be able to clean the walls because if 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:16.169
 we did it before we could start 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:20.370
 the good painting I hope you have 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.020
 liked and if you do not dare to 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.259
