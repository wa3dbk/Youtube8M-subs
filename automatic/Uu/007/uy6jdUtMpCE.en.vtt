00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
power-ups not really something I

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.290 
power-ups not really something I
typically<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.520> I'll<00:00:35.850> let<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.149> guys

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
out of hat here there's definitely a lot

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
out of hat here there's definitely a lot
of<00:00:40.680> content<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.309> there's<00:00:41.460> 95<00:00:41.910> levels<00:00:42.390> or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of content I think there's 95 levels or

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
of content I think there's 95 levels or
so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.989> launched<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.800> more<00:00:44.129> levels<00:00:44.340> coming

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so I launched with more levels coming

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
so I launched with more levels coming
down<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> road<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.410> episode<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
down the road the first episode is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
down the road the first episode is
hammer<00:00:47.670> fest<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:49.910> launch<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.210> can

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
hammer fest and you launch that you can

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
hammer fest and you launch that you can
see<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.809> there's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> bunch<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.649> levels<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
see it's there's a bunch of levels in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
see it's there's a bunch of levels in
here<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:54.030> unlocked<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> linearly

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
here that are unlocked kind of linearly

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
here that are unlocked kind of linearly
it<00:00:56.219> definitely<00:00:56.640> starts<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it definitely starts out as kind of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
it definitely starts out as kind of
linear<00:00:57.629> gameplay<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.910> as<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> progress

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
linear gameplay but as you progress

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
linear gameplay but as you progress
there<00:01:00.750> tends<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.410> offshoots<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there tends to be some offshoots and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.729 
there tends to be some offshoots and
different<00:01:02.609> challenges<00:01:03.059> different

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
different challenges different

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.960 
different challenges different
objectives<00:01:04.739> within<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> levels<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.640> mean<00:01:05.670> some

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
objectives within the levels I mean some

of the levels have you know kind of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100 
of the levels have you know kind of
basically<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.850> objective<00:01:09.080> which<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
basically just one objective which is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140 
basically just one objective which is
just<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.010> rescue<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> Vikings<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.970> are

just to rescue the Vikings that are
trapped<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.540> ice<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> once<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.070> through

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
trapped in ice and once you go through

all the dialogues you can see you do

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.850 
all the dialogues you can see you do
that<00:01:15.900> by<00:01:16.140> cutting<00:01:17.009> similar<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.060> cut<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> rope

that by cutting similar to cut the rope

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.230 
that by cutting similar to cut the rope
but<00:01:19.860> you're<00:01:20.130> basically<00:01:20.820> you're<00:01:20.909> trying<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
but you're basically you're trying to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.520 
but you're basically you're trying to
cut<00:01:21.979> with<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.130> fewer<00:01:23.460> cuts<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.880> possible

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
cut with as fewer cuts as possible

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
cut with as fewer cuts as possible
dropping<00:01:25.530> ice<00:01:25.680> into<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> boat<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.630> his

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
dropping ice into the boat so that his

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
dropping ice into the boat so that his
Viking<00:01:28.530> buddy<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.100> free<00:01:29.400> him<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.390> ice

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
Viking buddy can free him from the ice

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.260 
Viking buddy can free him from the ice
and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.310> objective<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and then your other objective in this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
and then your other objective in this
particular<00:01:33.479> level<00:01:33.780> where<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> collect<00:01:34.380> coins

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
particular level where you collect coins

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
particular level where you collect coins
so<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.400> primary<00:01:35.790> objective<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> free<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.490 
there are power objectives which
basically<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.490> try<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> do

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
basically is you have to try to do

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.690 
basically is you have to try to do
complete<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> level<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.009> fewest<00:01:47.399> number<00:01:47.490> of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
complete the level and fewest number of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.240 
complete the level and fewest number of
cuts<00:01:48.000> possible<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
cuts possible and then there are like a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.450 
cuts possible and then there are like a
hurting<00:01:50.700> objective<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.920> kind<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
hurting objective that you know kind of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
hurting objective that you know kind of
again<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.880> separate<00:01:54.299> objective<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
again a separate objective which is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
again a separate objective which is
related<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.890> shepherding<00:01:56.430> goats<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
related to like shepherding goats I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240 
related to like shepherding goats I
think<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.500> anyway<00:01:59.100> we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
think is what they are but anyway we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.469 
think is what they are but anyway we
haven't<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.520> progressed<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.090> far<00:02:00.149> in

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
haven't really progressed that far in

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.359 
haven't really progressed that far in
the<00:02:00.570> game<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.259> haven't<00:02:01.829> yet<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.130> show<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the game or I haven't yet to show you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.649 
the game or I haven't yet to show you
that<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> other<00:02:03.149> people<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.540> have

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that some of the other people that have

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.690 
that some of the other people that have
played<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.979> we'll<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.189> walk<00:02:05.460> throughs

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
played have so we'll have walk throughs

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
played have so we'll have walk throughs
and<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> check<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.210> out<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> see<00:02:06.719> see

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and you can check that out to see see

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.359 
and you can check that out to see see
those<00:02:07.350> different<00:02:07.619> objectives<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.190> anyway

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
those different objectives but anyway

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.390 
those different objectives but anyway
the<00:02:08.489> game<00:02:08.610> plays<00:02:08.849> which<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.780> fun<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.110> unique

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
the game plays which is fun and unique

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
the game plays which is fun and unique
so<00:02:11.400> let's<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:11.970> after<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.810> started<00:02:13.170> here

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
so let's just go after we started here

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.670 
so let's just go after we started here
let's<00:02:13.470> go

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
let's go

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.819 
let's go
back<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.099> map<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.260> see<00:02:16.409> as<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
back to the map and you can see as you

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.860 
back to the map and you can see as you
progress<00:02:17.069> here<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:17.969> are<00:02:18.180> different

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
progress here there are different

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.839 
progress here there are different
numbers<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> coins<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.069> are<00:02:20.250> available<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
numbers of coins that are available and

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.360 
numbers of coins that are available and
this<00:02:21.599> level<00:02:21.870> actually<00:02:22.049> shows<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this level actually shows you that the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.059 
this level actually shows you that the
level<00:02:23.640> start<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:23.909> get<00:02:24.030> quite<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> bit<00:02:24.569> bigger

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
level start to get quite a bit bigger

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.309 
level start to get quite a bit bigger
this<00:02:26.069> one<00:02:26.250> actually<00:02:26.430> has<00:02:26.760> two<00:02:27.599> finger<00:02:27.959> scroll

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
this one actually has two finger scroll

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.530 
this one actually has two finger scroll
shows<00:02:28.829> it's<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.219> tutorial<00:02:29.579> stage<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.450> you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
shows it's like a tutorial stage and you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.759 
shows it's like a tutorial stage and you
have<00:02:30.689> that<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.019> use<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.379> fingers<00:02:31.739> to

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
have that you can use two fingers to

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.280 
have that you can use two fingers to
scroll<00:02:32.099> back<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.489> forth<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.019> also<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
scroll back and forth so this is also a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.539 
scroll back and forth so this is also a
good<00:02:34.409> example<00:02:34.469> of<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.159> being<00:02:35.370> multiple

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
good example of there being multiple

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.479 
good example of there being multiple
objectives<00:02:36.329> so<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.689> one<00:02:37.099> first<00:02:38.099> objective

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
objectives so this one first objective

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.220 
objectives so this one first objective
getting<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.030> Vikings<00:02:39.420> into<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> ship<00:02:40.049> is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
getting the Vikings into the ship is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.959 
getting the Vikings into the ship is
usually<00:02:40.530> pretty<00:02:40.859> easy<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.579> don't<00:02:41.760> mess<00:02:41.939> up

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
usually pretty easy if I don't mess up

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.569 
usually pretty easy if I don't mess up
here<00:02:42.389> know<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:42.840> recording<00:02:43.139> and<00:02:43.579> freeze

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
here know that I'm recording and freeze

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.699 
here know that I'm recording and freeze
him<00:02:44.879> let's<00:02:45.720> free<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.139> guy

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
him let's free this guy

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.830 
him let's free this guy
I<00:02:47.120> don't<00:02:48.120> know<00:02:48.180> how<00:02:48.329> hitting<00:02:48.599> him<00:02:48.689> with<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I don't know how hitting him with a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
I don't know how hitting him with a
giant<00:02:49.109> hammer<00:02:49.439> is<00:02:49.680> freeing<00:02:50.010> him<00:02:50.159> but<00:02:50.430> he<00:02:50.819> seems

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
giant hammer is freeing him but he seems

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.520 
giant hammer is freeing him but he seems
to<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.269> happier<00:02:51.659> now<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.840> he's<00:02:52.109> in<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.349> book

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
to be happier now that he's in the book

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.229 
to be happier now that he's in the book
but<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.340> see<00:02:53.400> once<00:02:53.669> all<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.909> Vikings

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
but as you can see once all the Vikings

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.659 
but as you can see once all the Vikings
are<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.450> boat<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.870> level<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.620> done<00:02:55.919> so<00:02:56.639> I

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
are in the boat the level is done so I

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.550 
are in the boat the level is done so I
actually<00:02:56.909> get<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> other<00:02:57.689> objective<00:02:58.349> which

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
actually get the other objective which

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.339 
actually get the other objective which
is<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.859> rest<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.219> the<00:02:59.340> coins<00:02:59.549> you<00:03:00.349> actually

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
is the rest of the coins you actually

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.429 
is the rest of the coins you actually
have<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:02.510> get<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.659> treasure<00:03:03.870> chest<00:03:04.109> which<00:03:04.260> I

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
have to get the treasure chest which I

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.030 
have to get the treasure chest which I
already<00:03:04.590> grabbed<00:03:06.469> but<00:03:07.469> you<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.709> see<00:03:07.859> you<00:03:07.919> get

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
already grabbed but you can see you get

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.399 
already grabbed but you can see you get
the<00:03:08.129> coins<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.549> then<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.079> endings

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
the coins and then I see the endings

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.149 
the coins and then I see the endings
music<00:03:10.739> roll<00:03:11.689> so<00:03:12.689> let's<00:03:13.349> see<00:03:13.560> see<00:03:13.799> if<00:03:13.889> we<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.069> do

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
music roll so let's see see if we can do

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.729 
music roll so let's see see if we can do
this<00:03:14.310> oh<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.519> cut<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.000> wrong<00:03:15.150> rope<00:03:15.480> oh<00:03:15.810> that's

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
this oh I cut the wrong rope oh that's

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.240 
this oh I cut the wrong rope oh that's
horrible

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
horrible

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.330 
horrible
but<00:03:18.169> anyway<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:20.190> go<00:03:20.310> back<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.760> map

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
but anyway we go back to the map

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.589 
but anyway we go back to the map
basically<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.729> complete<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.209> different
