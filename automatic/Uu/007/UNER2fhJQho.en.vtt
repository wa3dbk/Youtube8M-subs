00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello my name is romance 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.099
 Today I will tell a little bit of August flour 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.990
 bathroom and here such a submariner as 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 his make me at work is like 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.540
 stepwise lines allows me to remove 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.730
 video I did not shoot the installation video itself 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
 bath because there really isnâ€™t 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 places now the camera is generally in 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.960
 the corridor so that you can 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.269
 to show something but I am an ordinary image here 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.910
 acrylic bath on ordinary standard 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.790
 legs adjustable legs i 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.370
 adjusted set bath in the wall and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.379
 from below on this here edge outlined 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 the line here is the bath height 60 centimeters 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.050
 I removed the bamboo and took the mounting 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 bar for mounting kitchen mezzanines 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.629
 screwed it along the wall on that wall and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.860
 on this and not twisting probably 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.100
 seven centimeters long 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.350
 Further I raised this bath and completely 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.090
 put the guides on it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 there we will make guides 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.610
 groove as he reached well, such Ivanna 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.400
 just getting 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.200
 but can in this case go there mind 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.660
 guide completely fill 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.450
 silicone but if you remember with the icons 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.970
 and you need to be there to raise or something 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.710
 change in adjusting silicone if you 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.410
 save whether to get it will be unrealistic 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.920
 so during the installation I'm this one 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.740
 here is the edge 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.010
 the calf turned away near the wall and here 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.970
 gave a layer of silicone somewhere 1cm it all 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.160
 the case came he even had my top cut 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.070
 shows sticks out probably millimeter 2 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.520
 it will be cut and here the tile will be on 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.950
 it gave me a bath I along two 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.080
 from the walls is so tough that she 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 doesn't even move at all 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.110
 to keep working on and do 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 dab I 'm always about me completely 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.100
 catching water 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.710
 why should I do it all the same 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.610
 of the summer I fly some form I really 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.410
 set installed set 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.690
 tag or squares checked four 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.000
 corner she stood perfect after 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.600
 bath is typed all here these tags 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.150
 sizes change and sometimes even 12 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.410
 millimeters because under the weight of water 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.480
 All the same there will be weight before and everything changes 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.660
 after that how i got the whole bath 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.660
 I'm still fresh 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.620
 I will adjust the legs, I expose everything 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.170
 four corners of the bath below the level 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.690
 when this thing is done legs I already 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 nuts are clamped and now in u2 itself is not 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.550
 see such a rather convenient submariner 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.180
 here here i will install drywall 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.490
 at an angle 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.100
 This is understandable so that I can access 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.960
 show you can approach the plan at all 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.690
 why i tell divers in this 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.760
 because see guys do who like me 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.890
 I also do it from drywall 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.990
 but in this case, here are the bars 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.720
 You know, there is no stuck Vanya. 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.970
 that is to screw one 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.010
 drywall guide profile 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.740
 there is nothing very convenient material 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.750
 foam blocks of them can be cut all that 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.840
 it turns out like that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.330
 you need to stand completely out of the foam block 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.550
 cut anything here think you 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.520
 I can see very well what I did 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.170
 drew a line like mine 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.060
 drywall will still be and i tried to 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.420
 how much will the tile be 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.720
 come up here here laid out the letters n 3 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.580
 foam block cut in half here 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.130
 I set this drywall risk 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.150
 first of all it is completely glue-free 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.640
 smeared 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.150
 he stuck here tight you see 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.190
 sound tight he stuck to the foam block 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.530
 also he is glued to you here and here 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.230
 when i installed this drywall sheet 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.959
 I cut these two slashes here 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.140
 such foam block wedges cut us 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.690
 convenient to 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.700
 cut perfectly up to the whole thing 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.069
 here we have installed exactly the eyes 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.200
 well, you know the distance of course all 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.970
 calculated all this i did yesterday here 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 you can see the mounting foam on the first not 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.480
 pay attention just worked backs 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.780
 and through was a small gap in the hotel 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.400
 usually I fill everything with glue 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.260
 the way he needs to bath leaked yet 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.830
 stands still and here he sold everything 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.200
 dried up 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.300
 here this case could still be given 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.690
 jumper but it's a habit absolutely not 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.510
 i need here i'm gonna make 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:43.210
 which we have for the movie is bad and here 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:45.580
 so just stuck a gypsum and me 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.290
 it will turn out that the tile will be 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.050
 here here there is still a small gap 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.169
 millimeters 5 is the residue on the glue cell 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.090
 it will be exactly with you now I'm these two 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.120
 I will fix the gordon dog with vacations 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.120
 on the screws and we will be fully prepared 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.120
 the paddle I'll stick only this part for 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.790
 so that you can see it not much 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.790
 uncomfortable glue can work 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.340
 apply to the block can be on 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:23.180
 drywall like him 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:23.180
 not important for foam blocks 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:34.470
 foam block holds better 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:41.160
 so the bike we are not but think on 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:47.220
 drywall would be and was clearly 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.270
 and take drywall , I expose it 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:06:01.830
 snapped up 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:06:03.000
 it comes right on top and where 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.919
 dino block allows 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.919
 Screws five tree 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:34.689
 you can take the phone shorter as you can see everything 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:37.419
 happens very quickly and exactly more 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.159
 My friend works Germany once 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.650
 He said they had the whole thing done 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:44.050
 social formation but we worked together 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.650
 such a design but part of the foam 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.539
 density 25 thickness 4cm 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.319
 nothing will still be there neither 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.319
 single crack 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.930
 it was wearing 2004 the fifth year that is 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:58.449
 it makes everything a lot more common 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.389
 then all these angles are internal and 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.830
 outdoor as well as drywall connection 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.259
 table necessarily when you will 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.520
 install tile 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:09.509
 the need for ice on the skin to give everything 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.919
 corners serpyanku tile stickers 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.719
 so if you liked the device 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.659
 such a submariner please do 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:18.939
 use very easy and easy to press 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.219
 there will be a hatch after we 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:24.159
 buy a flap because I don't know which one 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:25.510
 he will still mark the tile and very 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.340
 will be easy to cut out 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.460
 the hatch falls on the foam block 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.670
 trim that is very convenient practical 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.970
 and fast all of you good luck and good to new 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.970
 video
