00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
another big pause and short correction

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.640 
another big pause and short correction
pouring<00:02:18.940> them<00:02:19.060> very<00:02:19.420> very<00:02:19.720> deep<00:02:19.989> correction

very<00:02:21.190> significant<00:02:21.970> break<00:02:22.239> down<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.810> then

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
very significant break down and then

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.540 
very significant break down and then
ironically<00:02:24.420> quite<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> more<00:02:25.780> vigorous<00:02:26.550> break

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
ironically quite a more vigorous break

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.910 
ironically quite a more vigorous break
out<00:02:27.790> much<00:02:28.360> higher<00:02:28.599> afterwards<00:02:29.379> all<00:02:29.709> right<00:02:29.800> so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
out much higher afterwards all right so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.890 
out much higher afterwards all right so
the<00:02:30.010> big<00:02:30.129> takeaway<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.489> 2012<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.720> gold

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the big takeaway for 2012 is that gold

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.630 
the big takeaway for 2012 is that gold
will<00:02:32.140> move<00:02:32.440> higher<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.340> be<00:02:33.430> aware<00:02:33.580> of

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640

will move higher you have to be aware of
some<00:02:33.910> Corrections<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.599> breakdowns<00:02:34.959> though
