00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello, I want to make a video review 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.330
 this scooter for sale scooter 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 called yu b nails the price of such 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.410
 scooter new Voronezh 50,000 but two 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.260
 words tell you about up scooter scooter 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.410
 there is a deal optics led you 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:26.400
 turn signals for diode brake light 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.699
 mileage of this scooter 5190 four 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.099
 kilometer run carefully even 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 not the first technique I know how it sits that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.710
 in the future everything will depend 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 Is the scooter oil run correctly? 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.309
 only flooded the motul or motul action 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.649
 40 heat but cooler was 5th 40 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.620
 I poured oil on the service book 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.989
 after 300 after you look then with 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 interval after two also changed 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.940
 gearbox oil filter all 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 so shooting range engine in the motor never 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.770
 climbed 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.770
 Did not do anything 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.760
 the riders of the six dispersed 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.479
 just as the engine and say that at no time 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.700
 did not climb at all did nothing only 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.450
 adjusted valve pass 3000 because 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.310
 that graduation started tapping a little 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.500
 motor without a problem candle once 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 looked also spun running 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.670
 no problem at all without problems 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 after a week after a month prapor 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:40.470
 built-in scooter 2012 and departure and on 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.259
 it's half past summer and whole summer 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.710
 Well here it is not even the whole of his earlier 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:51.140
 numbers from additional equipment 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.950
 what i installed on a scooter is i set 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.950
 oil temperature sensor 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.220
 then I set the reverse alarm 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.080
 communication because the scooter is generally shelby 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.420
 climbed alarm 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.819
 Well put with feedback to be 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.370
 easier who do not know such an alarm with 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:16.260
 I will not demonstrate feedback 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.870
 look on the internet and put xenon 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.440
 6 kelvin more precisely not xenon bi xenon 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.440
 near far 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.350
 dipped high beams are very good 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.320
 optics decent on it is installed in 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.930
 difference from other scooters so about 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.380
 appearance Well, you can on this video 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.530
 actually a rug just like that at all 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.950
 here everything is ideally scooter to be honest 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.850
 brushing one bucket never drail but 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.579
 only from Karcher can it be easier better 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.040
 at least how much from which side 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.329
 look at the sun such a rahil 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.950
 brush questions anywhere else you find here 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.629
 that's basically all 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.040
 and about the fact that the Chinese scooter 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.220
 plastic does not rattle anywhere 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.239
 You can come check everything keeps 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.510
 all and ideally 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.090
 scuto pretty pretty caught 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.489
 butts just some damn here 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.290
 nothing rattles nothing knocks runs 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.000
 he is pretty frisky unlike 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.319
 others do not know the video to 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.410
 the internet on y tube like the others 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.830
 accelerate to be honest honestly speaking 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.569
 the speedometer here is less accurate 80 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.209
 you are driving 80 real kilometers per hour 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.190
 measured just for your interest with 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.769
 three cars compared with the Volga 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.040
 we even volsvagen a little less 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.959
 shows acceleration to 80 puts 15 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.510
 seconds if you don't believe you can come 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.260
 check well, that 's basically all thanks 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.209
 for your attention 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.060
 show turn signals like they are 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.040
 I certainly will not work like others 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.130
 Reviewers do this but everything is up to 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.130
 dating
