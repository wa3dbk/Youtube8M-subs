00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.380
 and then here we have the first brand 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.170
 in this case it is about kyocera with its 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.270
 torque device and a true brand 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.910
 that we quite well because we 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.290
 gave a special room to record us 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.059
 apart a little bit of what the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.640
 stand and the noise but we still had 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.430
 so much noise is to say that it is marked 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.830
 that's why I really liked the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.840
 presentation that I had is that they put you 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.540
 a helmets in standard in the fields 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.519
 well for like this and to teach you the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.140
 main function of the terminal a 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.420
 terminal of all battle is a terminal 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.530
 it's not a terminal truth tank and 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.239
 the first function that the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.580
 main function that has that is or not 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.610
 given by the brand itself is that through 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.970
 from the screen to vibrate mode is 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.710
 able to transmit the sounds and a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.180
 try that from this distance this time 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.000
 who put on helmets and put 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.330
 play a song and they hit you 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.280
 helmets the device to helmets and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.490
 through the vibrations of the screen 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.840
 the sound was passed to the helmets and it was 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 a wonder could also be put 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.890
 here on the neck and through the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.030
 vibrations that the sound could pass to 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.760
 ear 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.549
 the main things that the 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.830
 attention of this because in addition to being a 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.640
 terminal I already say a tank supports 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.880
 virtually all water shock or be 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.800
 a wonder a terminal that good that 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.680
 It's good for me to send us a copy 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.720
 if possible but at the moment it's not going to 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.520
 be because he's going out for france and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.500
 Germany and then it will go out to 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.810
 Spain so good I leave you with the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.540
 video of the review recited and on the stand 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.390
 of torque in mobile world congress 2015 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:08.709
 in video we are here in a project 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.570
 on why because the truth that I have been 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.040
 liked pretty has a technology 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.769
 awesome about how 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.269
 in the vibration function in hawaii 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.189
 snowplow also here in the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.689
 device the only thing that I have that I 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.609
 I would say it's a little fat and what 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.189
 only worse but you know it's a 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.049
 off-road the terminal 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.769
 all buttons are all physical buttons 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:35.189
 merge a multi button multitasking a 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.680
 trans and the audio device for 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.290
 multimedia that we will talk activity 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.290
 mind about him but the most important thing and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.250
 it's a function of Tuesday are and rest and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.680
 see what he does because the simple way is 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.829
 that when we are listening or when 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.470
 we transfer the sound to our to 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.680
 our person only by placing the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.959
 device on the helmet on the motorbike 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.329
 more anywhere glued the mobile 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.480
 to alter the phone to the helmet of the motorcycle 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.100
 for example it is not even super 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.240
 interesting that I like a lot 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.850
 we're going to see a little bit more about 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.880
 the terminal because good is missing it does not 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.150
 lack of nothing 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.850
 when you see the interface of the kindle 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.040
 determine very very nice and already gave the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.280
 technology that you carry unique from the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.380
 company patented by you that is 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.790
 completely sealed so if you 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.770
 we put as you see here in water or 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.360
 any the land has the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:40.170
 articulation 168 for water dust heat 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.690
 temperature drops that good even 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.300
 in water you could hear perfectly 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.460
 how the device keeps working 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.490
 As I did not like it, I liked it a lot and 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.800
 well I hope soon to test the whole 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.180
 so we have the chance to have him is 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.180
 say let's see a little more 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.249
 we see that in storage we have 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.840
 all together means that one thing I 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:09.120
 I always like to emphasize that 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.639
 is all all more elements in one in 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.439
 this case is perfectly the 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.819
 kioto company 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.880
 Well, that's pretty good, 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:22.109
 task and pretty good enough to talk about 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.300
 in battery 15,100 upper medium that gives 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.669
 a quite pretty good autonomy 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.669
 because it really has a screen that 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.960
 is full hd 2 gigs of ram 16 gigas of 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.110
 storage that you have seen in the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.080
 400 dragon and potential for there will 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.360
 lack of anything you can do any 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.400
 kind of use leeks and so on since 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.669
 besides all this I always said in the 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.710
 field so in presence of the field you can 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.320
 they are walkie talkie function that yes with 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.820
 another terminal of the same company the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.150
 same brand party is in cooking 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.949
 walkie-talkie that even without having 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.320
 opening coverage of our agencies 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.820
 and we can keep looking at everything 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.249
 moment determined in walkie function 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.409
 Very very intense talkies 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.229
 especially also other things for me 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.179
 very much like certain that on the 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.639
 flag are processed any kind of 

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:13.729
 glove that is resistant to everything 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.289
 type of devices 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.209
 it's a pretty pretty mobile 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.229
 interesting now keep watching more 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:21.949
 features of the android terminal 4 4 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.420
 two 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.550
 kit kat there you have it 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.920
 multitasking you know that it is native to 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.900
 chopping earth when you decide on everything 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.990
 It was specifications that supports 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.560
 both 3g and 4g networks of all kinds of 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.840
 networks between 850 and 900 thousand 900 thousand one hundred 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.220
 in four years it's absolutely almost 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.200
 practically all could be used 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.450
 practically in any country of 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.170
 Latin America even a screen that 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:54.400
 I do not know if I said that they are 4.5 4.5 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.650
 inch screen hd also say that 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.730
 supports external debit cards 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.850
 cards up to 128 gb connectivity 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.770
 has bluetooth wifi 4.0 in this regard 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.460
 that practically does not lack detail 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.970
 the cameras are pretty good 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.570
 8 megapixels for the third and two for 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.570
 the frontal 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.110
 a little 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.490
 how it works wonder the truth is 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:31.750
 the camera look to be 8 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.130
 megapixels that there are ending with 36 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.500
 but this terminal is focused 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.780
 back to people venture the 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.670
 country people who are the weight of everything 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.490
 ground the truth I see that here it has 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:45.540
 all the devices but that 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.750
 trigger here with physical trigger 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.540
 slot for sim cards and sd cards 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.580
 it supports cards are odd 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.220
 giving without for its operation and the 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.370
 true that the design of 21 looks very 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.680
 robust helps to see how it is 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.870
 practically screwed why 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.630
 must this super tight but even the 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.600
 local connections 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.700
 what are you certain products said 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.080
 the testers all kinds of respect 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.930
 about him 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.090
 very very good everything covered with technology 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.620
 same general form what yes I 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.240
 I stay and I like especially 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.450
 finished in smart technology that's 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.580
 than to know what a technology is 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.460
 which sound is transmitted by 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.580
 vibration to any area either 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.110
 banks whether it's even already in the field 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.830
 listening to music and 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.600
 present we can not put the area of 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.160
 neck and you could even hear it not 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.260
 perfectly transmits life a 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.900
 wonder that I like a lot and we wish 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:56.120
 very soon have a copy to shoot 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:57.979
 all terrain but to the desert this author 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.310
 that as a device remains so good 

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:03.680
 that is all finished and that we have 

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.180
 seen in the fair see the car lot 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.949
 that there do not do a lot of things like 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.320
 this one not here also have the option of 

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:11.090
 transmit the audio by vibrations 

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.449
 and that's all friends 

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.449
 goodbye
