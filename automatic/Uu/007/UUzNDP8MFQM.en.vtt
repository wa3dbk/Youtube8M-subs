00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
they don't have that and the stories
anymore<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.100> might<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.280> hard<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.730> find

anymore so it might be hard to find
maybe<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.399> diverting<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> while

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
