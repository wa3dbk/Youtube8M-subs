is<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.420> deconstruction<00:01:40.990> table<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.500> let<00:01:41.590> me

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
is the deconstruction table and let me

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.740 
is the deconstruction table and let me
show<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.010> how<00:01:42.160> you<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:42.940> actually<00:01:43.090> use<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.480> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
show you how you can actually use it so

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
deconstruction table you get this kind

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.890 
deconstruction table you get this kind
of<00:01:50.710> new<00:01:51.310> kind<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.730> GUI<00:01:52.060> looking<00:01:52.510> thing<00:01:52.690> here

items Baxter's going me to diamonds and
a<00:02:11.349> stick<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.040> what<00:02:12.190> i<00:02:12.220> use<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.730> craft<00:02:13.060> my

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600

diamond sword but guys like i just said

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.570 
diamond sword but guys like i just said
if<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.150> item<00:02:16.540> has<00:02:16.780> durability<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.980> it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
if the item has durability on it

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.070 
if the item has durability on it
this<00:02:18.730> chest<00:02:19.060> plate<00:02:19.270> right<00:02:19.480> here<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.900> has<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
this chest plate right here it has a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080 
this chest plate right here it has a
little<00:02:20.290> bit<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.530> durability<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.700> put<00:02:21.910> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
little bit of durability if I put that

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.080 
little bit of durability if I put that
in<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:23.020> stop<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.560> mod<00:02:23.800> being<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.340> overpowered

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
in to stop this mod being so overpowered

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.750 
in to stop this mod being so overpowered
what<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.420> will<00:02:25.600> do<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.170> will<00:02:26.230> take<00:02:26.650> away<00:02:27.070> from

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
what it will do it will take away from

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.510 
what it will do it will take away from
the<00:02:28.630> materials<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.680> use<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.950> craft<00:02:30.340> it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
the materials that you use to craft it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.210 
the materials that you use to craft it
if<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.180> item<00:02:31.690> has<00:02:31.900> some<00:02:32.230> damage<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
if the item has some damage to it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.920 
if the item has some damage to it
because<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.490> guys<00:02:33.730> know<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.510> diamond

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
because you guys know that a diamond

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.420 
because you guys know that a diamond
chestplate<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.410> used<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> make<00:02:35.860> like<00:02:36.220> this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
chestplate you used to make like this

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.830 
chestplate you used to make like this
there's<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.760> diamond<00:02:37.120> missing<00:02:37.420> right<00:02:37.600> there

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
there's a diamond missing right there

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.200 
there's a diamond missing right there
but<00:02:38.020> that's<00:02:38.170> taken<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.950> away<00:02:39.040> because<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
but that's taken it away because the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.550 
but that's taken it away because the
diamond<00:02:40.600> chestplate<00:02:40.750> has<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.170> little<00:02:41.440> bit<00:02:41.530> of

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
diamond chestplate has a little bit of

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.080 
diamond chestplate has a little bit of
damage<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.160> kind<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.430> balances<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:43.000> out

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
damage so that kind of balances it out

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.610 
damage so that kind of balances it out
it<00:02:43.300> doesn't<00:02:43.450> make<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.780> too<00:02:43.930> overpowered<00:02:44.500> so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it doesn't make it too overpowered so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.160 
it doesn't make it too overpowered so
you<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:44.920> get<00:02:45.550> all<00:02:45.880> majority<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.780> Diamonds

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you can get all majority of the Diamonds

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.690 
you can get all majority of the Diamonds
back<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> gave<00:02:48.280> me<00:02:48.460> nine

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
back like that and it gave me nine

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.520 
back like that and it gave me nine
diamonds<00:02:49.210> there<00:02:49.510> which<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.900> think<00:02:50.140> take<00:02:50.410> away

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
diamonds there which I think take away

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.890 
diamonds there which I think take away
two<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.040> gave<00:02:51.130> me<00:02:51.250> seven<00:02:51.520> diamonds<00:02:51.900> for

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
two so it gave me seven diamonds for

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.840 
two so it gave me seven diamonds for
that<00:02:53.050> damage<00:02:53.650> chess<00:02:54.070> player<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.550> really

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850

that damage chess player it's really
really<00:02:55.090> cool<00:02:55.270> so<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:55.960> let<00:02:56.290> me<00:02:56.380> give<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.620> an

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
example you guys are fully done this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.600 
example you guys are fully done this
before<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.350> going<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.980> make<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.370> iron

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
before you going to make some iron

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.750 
before you going to make some iron
swords<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:01.860> let's<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.100> grab<00:03:03.400> half<00:03:03.610> of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
swords like this let's like grab half of

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.890 
swords like this let's like grab half of
these<00:03:03.940> you're<00:03:04.510> going<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.750> add<00:03:04.870> you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
these you're going to add you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.540 
these you're going to add you
accidentally<00:03:05.530> press<00:03:05.709> shift<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.190> you've<00:03:06.280> made

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
accidentally press shift and you've made

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.570 
accidentally press shift and you've made
too<00:03:06.760> many<00:03:07.650> iron<00:03:08.650> swords<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.490> you
