00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.179

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.230
 I had I know I do a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.230
 map 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.420

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.440
 surprise for most of you 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 probably not that big 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.610
 Most of you want surprise 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 because martin jet are in a team 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.579
 official statement that we are in 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.649
 a team and we will 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 hopefully shave the old ones properly 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.049
 Round is fully decimated already because team 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.700
 Green does not mean it has scared yes 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.990
 people and we can also attend this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.330
 make another announcement 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 Do not just do it in a skewer team 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.020
 are but what else jx there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.600
 something they have to train yes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 we would not until newron was there 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.300
 train my brother yes as would 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 we karl would be it and your brother would 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.710
 want to train with us 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.410
 Well, we will train it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.390
 training with mainly lasts 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:44.680
 exist and thief is language to take off 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:48.270
 as with the pvp who were already good 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 shots the celebrated 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.940
 no you have just gone there 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.990
 built 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:01.270
 I now have time I say I 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 made me a monkey because I wanted 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.280
 it so rarely something to iron 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.770
 People as I said we will try 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:28.000
 is a little less common too 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:29.740
 do what the language and that 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.850
 other announcement we are only now 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.970
 come to a point 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.830
 the application is that we have a set 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.450
 Exercise the scripting language a bit 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.200
 for the right moments and 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.440
 On the other hand, we just become like that 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:57.580
 Doing a few training sessions means 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:58.810
 just times and on the occasion of our was 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.220
 but three teams will be with this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.410
 break tradition and with this 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:15.070
 tradition reckoned with a tradition 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:17.130
 I probably have a short movie 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.420
 but they sometimes run like that 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.670
 Wahlparty months yours in two teams 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.280
 we'll be able to do it maybe 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.290
 sometimes hunger games or because 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.540
 something freaky that we do 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.470
 play sg as if there would be a game 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.650
 where we send your brother away spd 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.890
 top 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.450
 I still have more important where we are then 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.950
 made a huge mess 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.950
 have bigger in the background 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.500
 I do not know. I believe in something 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.500
 chuck norris and classroom 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.930
 exactly this language 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.790
 we will become these runners of language 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.420
 for respect behind the behind and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.720
 must not have our gold the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:21.290
 always funny from 9 to 11 and tyson 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:27.330
 Worst traveling welded fomc 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:29.520
 I have something for you then go 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:38.000

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.000
 so typical hate and founder of team red 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.320
 then jog by the hand of tomorrow 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:05:04.350
 We will make your goals so you have them 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:09.890
 falls off and you bloomed flowers to me 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.890
 a duel with that he has a bow 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.010
 michael klenner toccata from the top 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.620
 but was already given him three hit 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.970
 frosty it was the sword which my 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.530
 Alter I hate this ob eck sticks one 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.870
 I'm not good that I sturmfrei 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.490
 have been around for a few days I was 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.460
 write in recent times always to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.530
 if I'm going to take her but rightly 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.630
 also i have destroyed team red very much 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.700
 good for you, you are full of people 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.500
 that is, the teamwork of the others 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.790
 Of course, other teams just have to do so 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.480
 but we are simple 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.740
 I think you already have that 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 We realized that we are together and 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:05.280
 I was just a runway to Erich 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.960
 ran along there in the middle was missing 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.750
 unfortunately a blog and I do not have it 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:18.420
 and unfortunately I'm in the gorge 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:24.780
 disturbed ok just marched through boy 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:31.550
 because otherwise it will be okay what are going on 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.550
 yes, not if you are beaten 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:51.910
 she looks up people we have 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.590
 perfectly harmonized the come out 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.680
 no no has it harmonized in 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.670
 the video said someone wrote 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.670
