00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
because of yesterday I guess there was a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.910 
because of yesterday I guess there was a
problem<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.750> don't<00:00:12.780> think<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.200> disrespect<00:00:13.830> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the cronut guy I think the underlying

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.950 
the cronut guy I think the underlying
thing<00:00:16.770> was<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.730> were<00:00:18.180> protecting<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
thing was that we were protecting the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.450 
thing was that we were protecting the
guy

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
guy

back<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.820> were<00:00:23.910> mocking<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> fact<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.660> so

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
back we were mocking the fact that so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.480 
back we were mocking the fact that so
many<00:00:25.050> people<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.470> ripping<00:00:25.800> them<00:00:25.920> off<00:00:26.070> right

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and then the payoff when we got the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.189 
and then the payoff when we got the
