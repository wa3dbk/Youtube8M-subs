it happened and they were eaten by
electabuzz<00:00:35.859> so<00:00:36.859> basically<00:00:37.160> just<00:00:37.399> take<00:00:37.519> a

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
electabuzz so basically just take a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.680 
electabuzz so basically just take a
picture<00:00:37.760> of<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:38.000> Haunter<00:00:38.239> when<00:00:38.390> he<00:00:38.480> comes

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.080 

so<00:00:48.000> yeah<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.830> do<00:00:49.830> think<00:00:50.190> however<00:00:50.310> it's<00:00:50.700> really

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
so yeah I do think however it's really

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.470 
so yeah I do think however it's really
really<00:00:51.330> cool<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.670> photo<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
really cool that the photo that you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
really cool that the photo that you
don't<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.900> Haunter<00:00:55.380> until<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> photos

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
don't see Haunter until the photos

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.080 
don't see Haunter until the photos
develop<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:56.910> awesome<00:00:57.060> I<00:00:57.360> think

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
develop that's pretty awesome I think

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
develop that's pretty awesome I think
let's<00:01:00.090> try<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.200> get<00:01:01.320> him<00:01:01.410> facing

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
let's try you want to get him facing

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.360 
let's try you want to get him facing
your<00:01:02.400> direction<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.120> much<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.450> possible<00:01:04.370> to

get the highest pose like not VAT but
like<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.860> let's<00:01:08.340> try<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.320> 970<00:01:10.320> going

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
like this let's try this 970 going

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
like this let's try this 970 going
pretty<00:01:10.740> well<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> we
