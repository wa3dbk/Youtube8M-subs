00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
finger fastball once they know how to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.920 
finger fastball once they know how to
grip<00:01:52.130> these<00:01:52.340> pitches<00:01:52.880> I'll<00:01:53.299> teach<00:01:53.720> them<00:01:53.900> how

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
grip these pitches I'll teach them how

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.870 
grip these pitches I'll teach them how
to<00:01:54.080> pull<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:54.650> pitch<00:01:54.950> from<00:01:55.189> their<00:01:55.430> glove<00:01:55.670> and

to pull that pitch from their glove and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.520 
to pull that pitch from their glove and
and<00:01:56.030> use<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.689> right<00:01:56.869> wrist<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.320> forearm

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
and use the right wrist and forearm

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.260 
and use the right wrist and forearm
angle<00:01:58.159> however<00:01:59.150> as<00:01:59.390> they<00:01:59.570> get<00:01:59.780> older<00:02:01.270> what

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
angle however as they get older what

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.880 
angle however as they get older what
they<00:02:02.420> can<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.869> pull<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.619> like<00:02:03.829> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
they can do is pull it out just like a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.760 
they can do is pull it out just like a
fastball<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.759> then<00:02:04.909> find<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.630> find<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
fastball and then find that find the
