a ziplock baggie so first you're gonna

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250 
a ziplock baggie so first you're gonna
take<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> cup<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.400> peanut<00:00:29.730> butter<00:00:30.109> pour<00:00:31.109> the

take the cup of peanut butter pour the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440 
take the cup of peanut butter pour the
chocolate<00:00:31.410> chips<00:00:31.830> into<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.910> tablespoon

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
chocolate chips into it and a tablespoon

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
chocolate chips into it and a tablespoon
of<00:00:33.719> butter<00:00:33.809> you're<00:00:34.410> gonna<00:00:34.530> pop<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
of butter you're gonna pop this in the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.290 
of butter you're gonna pop this in the
microwave<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.790> you're<00:00:35.910> gonna<00:00:36.059> use

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
microwave and you're gonna use

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.740 
microwave and you're gonna use
thirty-second<00:00:37.200> increments<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:38.040> find<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
thirty-second increments I find that it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
thirty-second increments I find that it
does<00:00:39.989> take<00:00:40.230> two<00:00:40.559> thirty-second<00:00:41.280> increments

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
does take two thirty-second increments

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
does take two thirty-second increments
so<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.540> looks<00:00:42.780> after<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.320> first

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so this is how it looks after the first

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.740 
so this is how it looks after the first
one<00:00:43.770> you're<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.309> gonna<00:00:44.579> mix<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.390> well

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
one you're just gonna mix it really well

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.060 
one you're just gonna mix it really well
and<00:00:45.780> you'll<00:00:46.110> still<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.440> some<00:00:46.649> chunky

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and you'll still have some chunky

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
and you'll still have some chunky
consistency<00:00:47.250> pop<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> back<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:49.320> second

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
consistency pop it back in this second

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.130 
consistency pop it back in this second
time<00:00:50.129> around<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> perfect<00:00:51.149> consistency<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
time around is the perfect consistency I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.220 
time around is the perfect consistency I
find<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.039> melt<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.699> you're<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
find to melt it you're also going to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.459 
find to melt it you're also going to
need<00:00:55.620> six<00:00:56.370> total<00:00:56.879> cups<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> rice<00:00:57.840> krispies

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
need six total cups of the rice krispies

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.599 
need six total cups of the rice krispies
or<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> rice<00:00:59.070> Chex

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
or the rice Chex

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
or the rice Chex
and<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.940> usually<00:01:00.690> yields<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and that usually yields about one and a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.560 
and that usually yields about one and a
half<00:01:01.680> boxes<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:03.030> careful<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.480> your

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
half boxes be careful with your

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.000 
half boxes be careful with your
chocolate<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> let<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.739> sit

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
chocolate because if you let it sit

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
chocolate because if you let it sit
there<00:01:05.189> while<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.610> pouring<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> chucks

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there while you're pouring your chucks

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
there while you're pouring your chucks
mix<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> trying<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> film<00:01:07.860> you'll<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
mix and trying to film you'll get this

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
mix and trying to film you'll get this
like<00:01:09.000> chunky<00:01:09.659> consistency<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> does<00:01:11.460> take

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
like chunky consistency so it does take

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
like chunky consistency so it does take
a<00:01:11.880> little<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.409> more

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
a little bit of more a little bit more

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.460 
a little bit of more a little bit more
time<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.250> work<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.330> than<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.200> just

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
time to work with it than if you just

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.580 
time to work with it than if you just
melted<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:18.210> does<00:01:18.509> eventually<00:01:18.840> come<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
melted it it does eventually come to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.340 
melted it it does eventually come to
consistency<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.580> folding<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> pani<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
consistency and folding in a pani you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.490 
consistency and folding in a pani you
know<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.100> does<00:01:23.939> work<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.900> me

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
know over and over does work out so me

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
know over and over does work out so me
being<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.070> silly<00:01:26.400> person<00:01:26.670> didn't<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
being a silly person didn't have a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
being a silly person didn't have a
ziplock<00:01:27.780> bag<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.290> using<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.770> steam<00:01:29.009> bag

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
ziplock bag so I'm using a steam bag

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.100 
ziplock bag so I'm using a steam bag
which<00:01:29.460> works<00:01:29.670> perfectly<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.479> instead<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
which works perfectly and instead of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.780 
which works perfectly and instead of
using<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> spoon<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.920> scooping<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.549> Trek's
