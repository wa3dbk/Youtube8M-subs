touch<00:00:06.480> before<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.200> speak<00:00:07.529> first<00:00:08.280> keyboard

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
touch before the speak first keyboard

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.190 
touch before the speak first keyboard
made<00:00:08.970> by<00:00:09.150> synaptics<00:00:09.690> which<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.960> course<00:00:09.990> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
made by synaptics which of course is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.320 
made by synaptics which of course is
known<00:00:10.500> more<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:10.800> its<00:00:11.340> touch<00:00:11.580> controllers<00:00:12.120> for

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
known more for its touch controllers for

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.480 
known more for its touch controllers for
phones<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.780> also<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.110> touch<00:00:13.349> pads<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.950> laptops

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
phones it also is touch pads for laptops

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.910 
phones it also is touch pads for laptops
so<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.690> here<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.960> still<00:00:16.289> very<00:00:16.560> far

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so what we have here is still very far

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.140 
so what we have here is still very far
from<00:00:17.070> final<00:00:17.490> version<00:00:17.820> there<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.029> many

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
from final version there are many

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.640 
from final version there are many
features<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.600> are<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:18.960> enabled<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.529> this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
features that are not enabled in this

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.380 
features that are not enabled in this
version<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> thing<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.029> when<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
version here but the thing is when I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
version here but the thing is when I
last<00:00:21.660> saw<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.680> early<00:00:23.100> demo<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:24.150> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
last saw this in a very early demo all I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.660 
last saw this in a very early demo all I
saw<00:00:24.630> were<00:00:24.779> single<00:00:25.230> keys<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.830> little<00:00:26.130> blocks<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
saw were single keys on little blocks of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.099 
saw were single keys on little blocks of
wood<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.779> time<00:00:27.930> I've

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
wood so what this is the first time I've

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.500 
wood so what this is the first time I've
seen<00:00:28.289> all<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> keys<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.070> an<00:00:29.220> actual<00:00:29.580> qwerty

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
seen all the keys in an actual qwerty

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.760 
seen all the keys in an actual qwerty
layout<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.260> actually<00:00:32.000> type<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.210> here

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
layout that I can actually type on here

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.900 
layout that I can actually type on here
what's<00:00:34.770> interesting<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.340> what's<00:00:35.489> coming<00:00:35.790> in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
what's interesting and what's coming in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
what's interesting and what's coming in
later<00:00:36.090> versions<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> entire

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
later versions is that the entire

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.280 
later versions is that the entire
underlying<00:00:37.980> panel<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.700> will<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.809> Coquette

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
underlying panel here will be a Coquette

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
underlying panel here will be a Coquette
will<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> capacitive<00:00:41.370> surface<00:00:41.760> similar<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
will be a capacitive surface similar to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
will be a capacitive surface similar to
a<00:00:42.300> touchpad<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.290> instance<00:00:43.399> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.520> do

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a touchpad so for instance you can do

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.950 
a touchpad so for instance you can do
things<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.120> you'll<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.420> able<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.780> things

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
things like you'll be able to do things

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110 
things like you'll be able to do things
like<00:00:46.200> hover<00:00:46.440> over<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> key<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> key

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
like hover over a key and have the key

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.720 
like hover over a key and have the key
do<00:00:48.270> something<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:49.350> once<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> keyboard<00:00:50.460> sense

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
do something or once the keyboard sense

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
do something or once the keyboard sense
your<00:00:50.940> fingers<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.750> automatically

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
your fingers here it can automatically

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439 
your fingers here it can automatically
disable<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> trackpad<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.000> goes<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
disable the trackpad that goes with it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.350 
disable the trackpad that goes with it
presumably<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> synaptics<00:00:55.920> trackpad<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.180> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
presumably a synaptics trackpad so that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
presumably a synaptics trackpad so that
you<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> cursor<00:00:58.289> flying<00:00:58.590> around

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you don't have the cursor flying around

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
you don't have the cursor flying around
random<00:00:59.460> parts<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> page<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.390> don't

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
random parts the page when you don't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.080 
random parts the page when you don't
want<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.309> pronounce<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.579> should<00:01:02.910> say

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
want it to pronounce you I should say

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.170 
want it to pronounce you I should say
that<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> final<00:01:04.920> feel<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> keyboard<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that the final feel of the keyboard is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
that the final feel of the keyboard is
well<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> final

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
well this is not going to be the final

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
well this is not going to be the final
feel<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> keyboard<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.030> personally<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
feel of the keyboard so personally I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
feel of the keyboard so personally I
think<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.860> keys<00:01:11.070> feel<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> little<00:01:11.520> bit

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
think that the keys feel a little bit

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.820 
think that the keys feel a little bit
flappy<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.479> part<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> reason<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
flappy right now part of the reason for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.899 
flappy right now part of the reason for
that<00:01:13.860> might<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.220> Dickies<00:01:14.610> move

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that might be the Dickies move

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.249 
that might be the Dickies move
diagonally<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.229> like

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
diagonally and not up and down like

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.929 
diagonally and not up and down like
traditional<00:01:16.860> keys<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.400> why<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.670> feel<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
traditional keys that's why they feel a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.580 
traditional keys that's why they feel a
little<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.600> trapdoors<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.939> but<00:01:20.939> what

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
little bit like trapdoors here but what

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.920 
little bit like trapdoors here but what
what<00:01:22.590> synaptic<00:01:23.040> says<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.450> keys<00:01:24.659> will

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
what synaptic says is that the keys will

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.719 
what synaptic says is that the keys will
be<00:01:24.960> fine<00:01:25.290> tuned<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:25.770> different<00:01:25.979> OEM<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.549> some

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
be fine tuned four different OEM so some

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
be fine tuned four different OEM so some
OEMs<00:01:27.180> might<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> different<00:01:27.780> feel<00:01:28.170> for

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
OEMs might want a different feel for

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
OEMs might want a different feel for
their<00:01:28.710> keyboard<00:01:29.130> maybe<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.610> wanted<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> feel

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
their keyboard maybe they wanted to feel

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
their keyboard maybe they wanted to feel
firmer<00:01:30.659> maybe<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.049> wanted<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> feel<00:01:31.530> bit

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
firmer maybe they wanted to feel bit

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
firmer maybe they wanted to feel bit
softer<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> sort<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> thing

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
softer that's the sort of thing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.060 
softer that's the sort of thing
synaptics<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.810> actually<00:01:34.259> able<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.560> adjust

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
synaptics is actually able to adjust

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.289 
synaptics is actually able to adjust
even<00:01:35.460> though<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> underlying<00:01:36.119> architecture

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
even though the underlying architecture

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.340 
even though the underlying architecture
of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> keys<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
of the keys is it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.800 
of the keys is it
so<00:01:39.580> we'll<00:01:40.580> be<00:01:40.670> looking<00:01:40.700> forward<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.360> testing<00:01:41.750> a

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
so we'll be looking forward to testing a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.290 
so we'll be looking forward to testing a
more<00:01:41.990> final<00:01:42.380> version<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.760> more

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
more final version of this in a more

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.970 
more final version of this in a more
final<00:01:44.690> machine<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.170> course<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.620> an<00:01:45.710> older

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
final machine of course this is an older

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.110 
final machine of course this is an older
Lenovo<00:01:46.340> machine<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:46.790> just<00:01:46.970> been

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
Lenovo machine it's just been

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360 
Lenovo machine it's just been
retrofitted<00:01:47.510> with<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.020> sample<00:01:48.410> keyboard<00:01:48.770> but

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
retrofitted with the sample keyboard but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.890 
retrofitted with the sample keyboard but
this<00:01:49.430> has<00:01:49.580> been<00:01:49.700> my<00:01:49.850> first<00:01:50.030> experience<00:01:50.660> just

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
this has been my first experience just

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.800 
this has been my first experience just
typing<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:51.850> all<00:01:52.850> together<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.330> bet<00:01:53.570> there<00:01:53.750> is

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
typing on it all together I bet there is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.200 
typing on it all together I bet there is
a<00:01:53.840> bit<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.140> learning<00:01:54.260> curve<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:55.210> that's

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
a bit of a learning curve but that's

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.440 
a bit of a learning curve but that's
been<00:01:56.390> our<00:01:56.480> first<00:01:56.600> take<00:01:56.870> thanks<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.290> much
