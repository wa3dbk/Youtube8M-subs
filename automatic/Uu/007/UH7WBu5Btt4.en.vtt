00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.480
 bergamasco di bari never domo mai camera 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.480
 but the number 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.449
 2 right or left 2 for brake food 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.410
 on the right where of mud 20 left 3 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.409
 less mud among three menos of mud in 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.800
 right one gets mud and left turn now 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.909
 make mud sorry turn around the mango the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.259
 hard right and dry long dry mud 2 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.259
 long mud 20 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.860
 but yes we say the race itself 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.020
 it was going very well because the first one 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.750
 once we use the fi5 r 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.870
 very competitive machine we liked it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.790
 lots of dinner since the tests and we did 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.890
 the race very well pity today 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.960
 sculpturine his descent we have 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.640
 lightly touched the right wheel e 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.610
 so it broke they had to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.890
 unfortunately there was a plate of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.190
 ice that I have not seen well and I am 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.120
 slipped on against the wall we have 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.670
 touched the wheel a little 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.130
 pity that it is part of the game because it is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.630
 such a difficult race every corner is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 always a risk 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 so let's take note of it too 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.950
 for the future serious we will understand again in 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.110
 this beautiful race not to do 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.190
 make mistakes like these the proof 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.930
 long 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.230
 I think it was more difficult because 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.990
 we ran many kilometers like 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.050
 help on snowy sections so not 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.670
 however, there was nothing going on in the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.040
 complex went pretty well by 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.470
 we have done secondino branch of the pros 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.640
 motion so we were not looking for risk 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.440
 to risk that much 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.720
 as I said the car there too on those 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.330
 funds so slippery it behaved 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 the tires worked well too the team worked 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.260
 really good
