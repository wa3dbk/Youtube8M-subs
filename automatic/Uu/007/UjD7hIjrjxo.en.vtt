00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
around the edges that's what we're

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:37.090 
around the edges that's what we're
looking<00:03:23.600> for<00:03:31.990> back<00:03:32.990> to<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> boil<00:03:33.560> here<00:03:36.100> I'm

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
looking for back to a boil here I'm

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.400 
looking for back to a boil here I'm
going<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.790> add<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.360> little<00:03:38.390> bit<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:39.020> cream

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
going to add just a little bit of cream

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.850 
going to add just a little bit of cream
to<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:40.210> that<00:03:41.210> it<00:03:41.600> takes<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.020> harshness<00:03:42.440> off

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
to this that it takes the harshness off

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.670 
to this that it takes the harshness off
it<00:03:43.220> smoothes<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.240> a<00:03:44.300> bit<00:03:44.420> not<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.500> this

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
it smoothes it out a bit not that this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.310 
it smoothes it out a bit not that this
is<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.890> harsh<00:03:46.250> sauce<00:03:46.640> it's<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.600> good

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
is a harsh sauce it's just a good

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.500 
is a harsh sauce it's just a good
complement<00:03:49.000> typically<00:03:50.000> if<00:03:50.060> you're<00:03:50.150> going<00:03:50.390> to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
complement typically if you're going to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.290 
complement typically if you're going to
add<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.690> lot<00:03:50.960> of<00:03:50.990> cream<00:03:51.490> cold<00:03:52.490> or<00:03:52.730> room

temperature<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:54.200> something<00:03:54.620> hot<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.520> should

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
temperature to something hot you should

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.580 
temperature to something hot you should
heat<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> up<00:03:56.210> first<00:03:56.540> if<00:03:56.990> you're<00:03:57.140> just<00:03:57.320> going<00:03:57.500> to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
heat it up first if you're just going to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.790 
heat it up first if you're just going to
add<00:03:57.770> a<00:03:57.800> little<00:03:58.160> bit<00:03:58.690> like<00:03:59.690> I'm<00:03:59.960> adding<00:04:00.290> one<00:04:00.530> cup

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
add a little bit like I'm adding one cup

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.310 
add a little bit like I'm adding one cup
you<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.880> do<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.270> but<00:04:02.570> add<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.750> little<00:04:03.080> at<00:04:03.290> a

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
you can do that but add a little at a

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.340 
you can do that but add a little at a
time<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.680> stir<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.460> right<00:04:04.670> away<00:04:05.170> if<00:04:06.170> you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
time and stir it in right away if you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.260

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
add too much and it's ice-cold it will

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.720 
add too much and it's ice-cold it will
break<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.870> your<00:04:09.530> whole<00:04:09.800> sauce<00:04:10.370> will<00:04:10.700> be

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
break and your whole sauce will be
