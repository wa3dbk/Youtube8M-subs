question card and read it out loud to
all<00:01:20.610> players<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.630> question<00:01:21.990> might<00:01:22.170> look

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
all players the question might look

all players the question might look
something<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.130> how<00:01:23.729> many<00:01:23.939> even

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
something like this how many even

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
something like this how many even
numbers<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.260> other<00:01:25.530> racks

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
numbers do you see on the other racks
the<00:01:26.520> reader<00:01:26.760> will<00:01:26.970> answer<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.450> question

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
accordingly so if he sees four even

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
accordingly so if he sees four even
numbers<00:01:30.930> his<00:01:31.200> answer<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.830> for<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.549> other

numbers his answer will be for all other

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
numbers his answer will be for all other
players<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:33.930> take<00:01:33.990> notes<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.619> their

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
