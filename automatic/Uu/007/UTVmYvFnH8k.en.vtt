00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
all the chords are kind of structured

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.010 
all the chords are kind of structured
you<00:01:36.729> can<00:01:36.850> kind<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.119> split<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.509> into<00:01:37.689> five<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
you can kind of split that into five and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.139 
you can kind of split that into five and
four<00:01:38.409> works<00:01:38.770> quite<00:01:38.979> well<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:39.429> first<00:01:39.880> five<00:01:42.149> and

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
four works quite well so first five and

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.499 
four works quite well so first five and
then<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:45.569> what's<00:01:46.569> quite<00:01:46.840> well<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.579> however

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
then three what's quite well but however

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.179 
then three what's quite well but however
you<00:01:49.689> get<00:01:49.869> around<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.259> your<00:01:50.380> head<00:01:50.500> it's<00:01:50.799> in<00:01:50.979> nine

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
with our little finger okay and then it

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.400 
with our little finger okay and then it
repeats<00:03:32.690> around<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.500> we<00:03:33.590> go<00:03:33.709> again

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:50.370 

you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.710 

okay<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.730> essentially<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.330> whole

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
okay and that is essentially the whole

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.960 
okay and that is essentially the whole
intro<00:03:53.110> part<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.650> verse<00:03:53.860> there<00:03:54.730> may<00:03:54.820> be<00:03:54.850> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
intro part the verse there may be a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.670 
intro part the verse there may be a
couple<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.510> little<00:03:55.660> variations<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.560> you

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
couple of little variations that you

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.880 
couple of little variations that you
might<00:03:56.890> do<00:03:57.130> on<00:03:57.430> occasion<00:03:57.640> but<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.740> most

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
might do on occasion but for the most

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.070 
might do on occasion but for the most
part<00:04:00.190> that's<00:04:01.030> what<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.750> part<00:04:01.990> is<00:04:02.290> okay<00:04:04.080> the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
part that's what that part is okay the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.190 
part that's what that part is okay the
next<00:04:05.350> part<00:04:05.650> we're<00:04:05.920> going<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.630> B<00:04:07.630> minor<00:04:07.870> shape

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
next part we're going to a B minor shape

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.110 
next part we're going to a B minor shape
I<00:04:08.470> guess<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.460> call<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.760> bridge<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
I guess you call it the bridge of the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.660 
I guess you call it the bridge of the
pre-chorus<00:04:10.710> if<00:04:11.710> we<00:04:11.830> just<00:04:11.950> look<00:04:12.190> at<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.400> last

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
pre-chorus if we just look at that last

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.880 
pre-chorus if we just look at that last
D<00:04:12.940> shape<00:04:13.240> in<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.630> verse<00:04:13.930> it's<00:04:14.320> worth<00:04:14.620> looking

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
D shape in the verse it's worth looking

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.290 
D shape in the verse it's worth looking
at<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.160> fingering<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.790> get<00:04:15.970> into<00:04:16.180> it

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
at the fingering to get into it

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.660 
at the fingering to get into it
otherwise<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.840> really<00:04:17.290> really<00:04:17.680> tricky<00:04:18.070> so

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
otherwise is really really tricky so

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.250 
otherwise is really really tricky so
we're<00:04:18.790> going<00:04:18.940> from<00:04:19.239> our<00:04:19.480> D<00:04:19.660> shape<00:04:19.930> at<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.170> end

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
we're going from our D shape at the end

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.430 
we're going from our D shape at the end
of<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> verse

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.110 

I<00:04:25.870> would<00:04:26.870> recommend<00:04:27.370> getting<00:04:28.370> your<00:04:28.520> bar<00:04:28.790> ready

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
I would recommend getting your bar ready

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.360 
I would recommend getting your bar ready
for<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.420> b-minor<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.290> last<00:04:30.710> eighth<00:04:31.010> note

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
for the b-minor on that last eighth note

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.460 
for the b-minor on that last eighth note
of<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:32.120> verse<00:04:32.510> bar<00:04:32.870> there<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.170> go<00:04:33.290> into

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
of that that verse bar there to go into

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.320 
of that that verse bar there to go into
this<00:04:33.590> section<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.040> they<00:04:34.100> play<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.430> again

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.719 

okay<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.389> I'll<00:04:40.539> play<00:04:41.370> second<00:04:42.370> fret<00:04:42.580> on<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
okay so I'll play second fret on the

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.370 
okay so I'll play second fret on the
g-string<00:04:43.000> but<00:04:43.539> I'm<00:04:43.600> actually<00:04:43.720> borrowing<00:04:44.289> it

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
g-string but I'm actually borrowing it

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.279 
g-string but I'm actually borrowing it
with<00:04:44.500> my<00:04:44.590> first<00:04:44.889> finger<00:04:45.479> so<00:04:46.479> I'm<00:04:46.599> ready<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:47.169> go

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
straight on to the first note of the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.800 
straight on to the first note of the
pre-chorus<00:04:49.539> here<00:04:49.840> which<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:51.720> second<00:04:52.720> fret

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
pre-chorus here which is the second fret

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.300 
pre-chorus here which is the second fret
on<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.960> a-string<00:04:53.080> there<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:53.830> we're<00:04:53.979> gonna<00:04:54.069> go

okay<00:05:01.130> so<00:05:02.130> from<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.640> we've<00:05:03.180> got<00:05:03.420> essentially

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
okay so from that we've got essentially

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.639 
okay so from that we've got essentially
B<00:05:04.530> minor<00:05:04.710> shape

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:09.649 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:11.119

so<00:05:16.660> get<00:05:16.960> another<00:05:17.470> little<00:05:17.950> tricky<00:05:18.250> one<00:05:18.430> there

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.890 

okay<00:05:24.370> okay<00:05:25.150> next<00:05:25.480> well

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:38.180 

it's<00:05:31.800> all<00:05:32.040> familiar<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.610> shape

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.930 

across<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.210> date

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.869 

I'm<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:45.020> f-sharp<00:05:45.200> again<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.890> tricky<00:05:46.160> one

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.129 

little<00:05:50.879> variation<00:05:51.419> there<00:05:51.659> slightly

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
little variation there slightly

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.229 
little variation there slightly
different<00:05:52.409> to<00:05:52.499> the<00:05:52.529> verse<00:05:52.799> one<00:05:53.129> and<00:05:53.369> then

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:54.239 
different to the verse one and then

00:05:54.239 --> 00:06:09.879 
different to the verse one and then
we're<00:05:54.389> back<00:05:54.419> into

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.860
