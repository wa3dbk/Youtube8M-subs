 video that you at 5 hello and as third and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 last video today I'll bring you three 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 special paintings hidden as you want 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.260
 call him and they are seeing this in 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 screen is worth the venom the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 enemy of spiderman those of joker the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.080
 batman's enemy and those of the movie 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 tron legacy of disney which is this one of the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.760
 little machines that get inside and one of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 the motorcycles with blue lights and the motorbike 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 black well I will not show you how 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 you put these three types of colors and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 If I like this, I'll do a kind of 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.480
 series with different colors so 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
 come with the first color as they come 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 the saints we're just going to set this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.879
 so it's the color of ve is not worth the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 let's say the spiderman antagonist that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.680
 would be the villain let's say the other side of 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.190
 spiderman 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.470
 and it would be with paint we wanted here to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.730
 main color painting we would go to 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.080
 metalized we would go to black is worth this 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.140
 black that is here 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.930
 and we would select to go to pearl and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.340
 in the face two we have to take a 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.900
 kind of purple voucher 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.740
 who is here to see if it is for what 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 now we will see it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.940
 golden purple 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.940
 a plate is something 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.480
 it would be him 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.570
 the safer dweller I think they were two sides 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.570
 dark 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.700
 the first would be the lilac would be the lilac 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.720
 we give the lilac and in secondary color 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.530
 we would go to mate and put the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.530
 white frost 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.240
 over here white white frost full of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.350
 fire 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.710
 white ice valencia 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.080
 in wheels 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.330
 we would go to the color of the wheels 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.320
 I have this kind of wheels in your pack 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.289
 and his country is called the tires and in 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.010
 color of tires we would go to white 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.710
 what to see where is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.920
 It is captcha, it is here 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.010
 and already would be now we would have the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.770
 color less as you are seeing this 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.300
 would be let's say the color of venom is something 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.480
 to be a little videos and simple 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.170
 but it is the black and white color that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.180
 distinguishes ben or 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.790
 as you are seeing there we have with the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.450
 color joker vale would be the antihero by 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.670
 excellence that is bad batman is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.830
 the batman antagonist and it would be joker 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.050
 worth the bad par excellence and we 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.200
 we would go to paint we would go to color 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.420
 main and we would go to metal and this one 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.750
 we decided to purple schiffer I think it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.500
 call 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.760
 speaker prepared for the purple zamora 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.140
 purple bruise since it was seeing 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.020
 in alphabetical order it would be software us 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.210
 we would go to pearl and we would put 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.910
 the bright purple this here 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.380
 and we'd go with the side we 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.270
 we would go to classic and we would put the green 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.480
 green green green green that i love you 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.950
 green where green is green here 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.510
 we could the bright green is worth it 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.810
 here 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.750
 and as for the wheels 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.360
 we would put there are two types of errors 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.230
 you can put that is the guide this is 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.770
 the one that I have and then another 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.230
 is this what is it that is 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.040
 It's in a racing car I think it's a racing car 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.040
 it can be a fireball 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.900
 these are 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:04.510
 so that it is and the color would be the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.510
 green here would be to lose to dry 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.340
 here would be the green would be this here and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.620
 we would have the color of the joker here 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.900
 you are seeing the joker color of you 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.639
 forming traffic but that this would be 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.520
 let's say the color of the joker 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.889
 bad par excellence of the truth that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.229
 the color is very cool the tires 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.479
 you can put these or others as you want 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.740
 what happens that is looks more green more 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.870
 more green tire 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.139
 color tron legacy is worth the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.639
 disney tron ​​legacy movie of the 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.949
 little machines this ex put in and was 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.770
 like some motorcycles like that, black and blue with 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.990
 a blue front 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.530
 and it is done in the following way we will go to 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.379
 main color paints and we'll go to 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.379
 metallized we will take the graphite one 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:03.199
 what is this here and in pearlescence we 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.199
 we would go to ultra blue 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.100
 heart 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.180
 here ultra blue we will go to the color 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.640
 secondary 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.060
 metalized and we would also go blue 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.060
 winter 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:28.389
 do ultra and we would go to the wheels and 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.090
 in rolas we will have what kind of low wheel 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:37.520
 rider and we would put the one that is here 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.820
 we will paint it the color of blue 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.830
 fluorescent 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.849
 and accessible tires we could 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.869
 personalized 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:50.539
 and we would have the tron ​​de legacy here 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:51.139
 the little color that feels to the air and is the 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.360
 colour 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.089
 tron legacy as always trying 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.819
 caravan in is pretty cool truth 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.979
 you can choose the color you want and 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.770
 put it if you want to see it here are the 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.360
 23 so a little flashy well 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.249
