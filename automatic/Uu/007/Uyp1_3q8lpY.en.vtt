00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 here we are, the sunset is falling 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.750
 we arrived in the second area of ​​the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.320
 competition field of this trophy 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 there are the sectors a and b on this side 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.990
 first more to the east we find the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 sector b and then from west to sector a 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.000
 we will now see developments like that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.920
 they are going out if the race is on 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.200
 playing with other species than 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 those of other sectors or who is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.030
 in line with the captures just seen and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.480
 with the two antonio antonio perri that already 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.450
 you will know from youtube and antonia gresta 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.890
 a Genoese fisherman who mates with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.399
 he in this too many now we go to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.399
 get to know them closely 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.539
 here is what neo paris irons for 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.109
 youtube friends how are you and dear a 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.859
 all right we are seen already before if in the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.890
 within a month 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.700
 let us first look at anzio in more below Rome 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.950
 then qua genoa but you weren't in the air it was 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.500
 d'Aosta but not mica 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.650
 all the parts now also because it makes me 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.210
 pleasure 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.729
 a gathering even friends allegedly 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.190
 and entertainment and also how it's going 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.860
 the catch but for the moment I have to 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.000
 say that everything is silent we are waiting for a 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.280
 at dusk 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.020
 let's see what happens, however, mine 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.060
 fishing buddy I have to say that at least 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 another china is a rachel fish ha 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.530
 brought to caldes already tipped 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.770
 from the beginning of the climb it is done but now 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.899
 let's see how 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.299
 how they progress with the passing of 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.670
 race field hours as you feel like that 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.940
 first time in Liguria 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.220
 I really like it 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.950
 here however made of pebble sand 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.230
 then a beach to put 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.000
 example completely different from where I come from 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.980
 that I am of cosenza 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.750
 But I don't mind a new one 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.140
 reality that is learning to know 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.550
 some fish will reinvigorate some passion 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.550
 race field test
