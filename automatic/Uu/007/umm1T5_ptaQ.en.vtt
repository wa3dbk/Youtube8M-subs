00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
So this is our thruster, guys.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.440
Jump and shrug,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.800
rack position.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.280
From here, as coaches,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.360
you guys are looking for that loose fingertip grip, elbows up,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.180
you set your feet shoulder-width apart,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.580
and we're gonna go through three to five squats.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.460
As coaches, you're looking for those points of performance we went over today with the squats.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.100
I'm looking at that. Go ahead and give me three.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.740
I'm looking at that neutral spine, I'm looking at that depth.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.540
I'm looking at the knees tracking over the toes.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.960
I'm looking at the weight on the heels.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.940
There's a lot going on, but I'm going through my checklist.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.400
If I see that his elbows are down, I give him a cue.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.580
Hey, get your elbows up.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.860
If his knees are coming in, hey push your knees out a little more.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.860
Hey, weight on your heels, and so on.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.560
Be verbal. You guys are here to learn how to coach

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.540
don't be afraid to give a coaching cue,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.940
I promise you your athlete will appreciate it.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.400
Ready and go.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.540
Reset.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.280
Get all over Josh's elbows.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.480
Ready and go.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.240
Oh, I'm all over you. Yeah.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.360
Much better. Let him know, hey that was good.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.540
From here,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.580
switch into a close gripped

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.440
position. His elbows will drop ever so slightly.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.860
But the feet are gonna stay the same.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
From here, we'll execute five

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.100
three to five push press. A dip, drive and a press.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.600
I'll say ready and go.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.920
Freeze.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.400
You guys are looking at that midline

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.020
stabilization. Are those ribs

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.780
popping out? Is that bar in that frontal plane?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.360
Right over the mid-foot.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.560
You guys are giving him cues if you don't.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.880
Also, look at that rib cage?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
What does that look like. He's reallyâ€”oh, he's fixing it.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.280
What are we seeing with the ribs?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.580
What could we do to help?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.780
Give him a cue.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.940
And you guys can get in there and get tactile too.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.160
I see the ribs out, I'm like

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.140
Andreas lock that down. Good. That's what I'm looking for.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.720
I'm reminding him that I want those abs nice and tight.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.800
You might just cue him squeeze your butt, squeeze your belly so he has that strong foundation

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.840
to press fromm.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.400
He's gonna go all the way down. When his legs

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.160
straighten, that's when he's gonna press

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.820
so that core-to-extremity movement. So, ready and go.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.480
Now from the top position,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.240
in slow motion,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.360
the elbows are gonna break forward.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.660
Once the bar passes his eyes,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.860
It's like hey, it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800
it's starting to become time to go down.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.160
The bar touches his torso

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.680
that's the button that sends him into a squat.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.060
It's harder to control, right?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.260
Guys, come here.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.400
So, check out his descent,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.560
he's bringing the bar down a little bit early, so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.700
that cue, right when the passes

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.860
his eyes, and started to touch his torso

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.080
that's the the light switch that's like, hey it's time to make my descent.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.160
I don't want to start going down too early,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.940
that fourth rep was really good.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.460
Wait for that timing piece.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.940
Yeah, good descent. Much better.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.160
Are you guys seeing that?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.300
The bar's starting to touch, that's the piece there.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.760
Now this is the difficult piece.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.980
We're watching to make sure the hips open first

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.080
before the press.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.480
That's that core-to-extremity piece that we're watching.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.360
So you guys are giving cues. Elbows, knees,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.860
making sure that the timing piece is correct.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.360
What we don't want to see is the press happening first.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.780
This is what it looks like.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.300
He's pressing before the hips open.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.740
So again, delay the press. Wait until you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.960
feel your legs lock before you press.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.700
This is stuff you'll be coaching.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.700
Good depth.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.000
Relax.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.960
These aren't as strong as those hips,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.540
so we really want to have him delay that press

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.140
until he feels his butt squeeze or his legs straighten.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.020
Yeah, there you go. Flex your quads and punch.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.380
Now.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.260
You guys see the difference? The hips?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.200
So he goes in and out of that.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.500
Great. Come on over.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.340
We had some good moments in there, right?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.280
Had some good moments where you felt it, then what happened? What happened to the weight?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.400
Feels a lot lighter right?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.980
And then we do that wrong one and it feels heavier.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.020
I don't know about you guys, but I want 95 pounds

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.320
to feel like 95 pounds, not like 120, right?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.340
Relax for a second.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.660
Saw the ribs sticking out,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.580
we want to lock that down.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.100
What about his speed in comparison to Alex number two?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.280
What about his speed?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.840
Could he come up faster?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.820
Yeah, the faster I open up the hips,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.040
the more power is coming up toward the bar.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.240
Does that make sense?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.500
So at this point, where I'm just about to extend

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.980
that has to be fast.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.580
That gets lightening sent up to that bar

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.920
and we want lightening, we want fast.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.660
Come up faster. Punch.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.660
Oh, that's good speed.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.120
And relax. Great.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.500
Was he overextended as much, or was it much better?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.700
What do you think about the speed?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.680
Better.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.960
But we started to see, once we sped him up,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.800
where did the elbows start to go?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.700
Yeah, so there's a lot going on there with coaching.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.400
Man, where do I go? This pops up, this pops up ...

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.800
so you have to be really judicious thinking about

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.640
where do I want to go? What do I want to attack first?

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.780
I don't want to overwhelm him with, hey three things are wrong.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.260
I want to be really simple. Fix one

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.100
and then speed him up until something breaks down

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.620
fix the rest. Does that make sense, guys?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.240
We really triage.
