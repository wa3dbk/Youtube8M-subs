after<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> workout<00:00:22.910> your<00:00:23.910> muscles<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.510> been

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
after a workout your muscles have been

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.910 
after a workout your muscles have been
torn<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.350> bit<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.680> they've<00:00:25.830> been

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
torn down a little bit and they've been

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.529 
torn down a little bit and they've been
broken<00:00:26.310> down<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.939> protein<00:00:27.359> will<00:00:27.510> help

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
broken down and that protein will help

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.970 
broken down and that protein will help
build<00:00:27.930> them<00:00:28.140> back<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.830> get
