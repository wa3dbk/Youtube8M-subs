00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
talking about a show of some sort it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.870 
talking about a show of some sort it
wasn't<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.799> somebody<00:01:53.130> sitting<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> talking

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
wasn't just somebody sitting and talking

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
wasn't just somebody sitting and talking
but<00:01:54.869> I've<00:01:54.960> noticed<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.680> word<00:01:55.829> podcast

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
but I've noticed that the word podcast

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.700 
but I've noticed that the word podcast
seems<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.530> bleeding<00:01:58.530> over<00:01:58.710> into

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
seems to be bleeding over into

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.219 
seems to be bleeding over into
general<00:02:00.070> youtube<00:02:00.460> videos<00:02:00.940> as<00:02:01.270> well<00:02:01.299> now<00:02:01.780> so

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
general youtube videos as well now so

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.850 
general youtube videos as well now so
I'm<00:02:03.150> also<00:02:04.150> another<00:02:04.659> trend<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.710> they're

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
I'm also another trend is that they're

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.590 
I'm also another trend is that they're
getting<00:02:06.010> longer<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.790> longer<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.479> longer

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
getting longer and longer and longer

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.100 
getting longer and longer and longer
once<00:02:08.200> upon<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.470> time<00:02:08.729> 10<00:02:09.729> minutes<00:02:10.090> max<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.869> what

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
once upon a time 10 minutes max is what

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.910 
once upon a time 10 minutes max is what
what<00:02:11.620> most<00:02:12.190> people<00:02:12.520> did<00:02:13.230> maybe<00:02:14.230> 15<00:02:14.680> minutes

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
what most people did maybe 15 minutes

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.660 
what most people did maybe 15 minutes
and<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.910> um<00:02:16.300> yeah<00:02:17.200> there's<00:02:17.890> one<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.430> was

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
really enjoying not too long ago but

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.280 
really enjoying not too long ago but
they<00:02:21.459> seem<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:22.000> about<00:02:22.270> an<00:02:22.330> hour<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> half

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
they seem to be about an hour and a half

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.250
