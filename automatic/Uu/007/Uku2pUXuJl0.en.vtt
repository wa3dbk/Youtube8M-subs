use<00:00:29.220> icing<00:00:29.730> sugar<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.029> mine<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.449> opposed<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
use icing sugar in mine as opposed to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.470 
use icing sugar in mine as opposed to
caster<00:00:32.040> sugar<00:00:32.070> which<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.940> generates<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
caster sugar which just generates a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
caster sugar which just generates a
slightly<00:00:33.750> lighter<00:00:34.110> pastry<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> icing

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
slightly lighter pastry and as the icing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.580 
slightly lighter pastry and as the icing
sugar<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> gets<00:00:36.809> worked<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> little

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
sugar kind of gets worked in a little

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.069 
sugar kind of gets worked in a little
bit<00:00:37.680> better<00:00:38.000> i'm<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> add<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> 1<00:00:39.840> egg

which is vanilla bean paste this is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
which is vanilla bean paste this is
essentially<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> beans<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.489> inside

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

essentially all the beans from inside
the<00:00:47.850> pot<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:49.260> made<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> really

lovely bit really strong vanilla paste
so<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.480> goes<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> start<00:00:55.170> with

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
so that's one that goes in to start with

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
so that's one that goes in to start with
and<00:00:55.770> we're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> turn<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> mixture<00:00:56.850> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and we're going to turn the mixture on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
and we're going to turn the mixture on
and<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.629> we're<00:00:57.750> looking<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> kind<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and what we're looking for is a kind of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
and what we're looking for is a kind of
really<00:00:59.399> fine<00:00:59.670> breadcrumbs<00:01:00.239> stage<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> now

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
really fine breadcrumbs stage so now

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
really fine breadcrumbs stage so now
we're<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> stage<00:01:06.659> where<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.560> flour<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
we're at a stage where the flour and the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
we're at a stage where the flour and the
butter<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.150> sugar<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.600> combined<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> but

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
butter and the sugar is combined and but

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.859 
butter and the sugar is combined and but
it's<00:01:11.040> still<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.520> quite<00:01:11.790> wet<00:01:12.210> enough<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> form

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it's still not quite wet enough to form

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
it's still not quite wet enough to form
a<00:01:12.930> dough<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.100> add<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
a dough so all we do is add in the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
a dough so all we do is add in the
remaining<00:01:14.850> water<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.439> bring

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
remaining water and then it will bring

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.719 
remaining water and then it will bring
it<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.830> together<00:01:16.979> nicely

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.340 

so<00:01:20.729> only<00:01:20.969> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.359> bit<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> time<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.170> want

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
so only a little bit at a time we want

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.810 
so only a little bit at a time we want
to<00:01:22.409> add<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.679> in<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:23.189> very<00:01:23.520> slowly<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to add this in very very slowly the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.100 
to add this in very very slowly the
dough's<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.420> I've<00:01:30.479> started<00:01:30.719> to<00:01:30.899> come

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
dough's and I've started to come

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.289 
dough's and I've started to come
together<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:32.219> you<00:01:32.369> sort<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> pull<00:01:33.179> it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
together and when you sort of pull it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
together and when you sort of pull it
together<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.630> its<00:01:33.750> hands<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.200> forms<00:01:34.679> into<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
together in its hands it forms into a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.740 
together in its hands it forms into a
nice<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.819> shape<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.149> know<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.719> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
nice little shape so you know now that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
nice little shape so you know now that
that's<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.740> consistency<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that's about the right consistency and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.179 
that's about the right consistency and
is<00:01:38.789> ready<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.149> use<00:01:39.179> roll<00:01:39.929> this<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.319> on<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
is ready to use roll this out on a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.609 
is ready to use roll this out on a
floured<00:01:41.490> surface<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.420> line<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.929> pastry<00:01:43.380> tin

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
floured surface and line the pastry tin

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
floured surface and line the pastry tin
all<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.369> got<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:44.939> prick<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
all you got to do now is prick it and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
all you got to do now is prick it and
pop<00:01:46.319> it<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.829> fridge<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.100> chill<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
pop it into the fridge to chill for a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.809 
pop it into the fridge to chill for a
bit<00:01:48.319> okay<00:01:49.319> so<00:01:49.380> frangipane<00:01:50.219> tart<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
bit okay so frangipane tart is

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.719 
bit okay so frangipane tart is
essentially<00:01:51.720> made<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.799> almonds<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.640> it's

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
essentially made with almonds and it's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.359 
essentially made with almonds and it's
an<00:01:53.849> almond<00:01:54.270> flavored<00:01:54.869> sponge<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.920> filling
