volatile<00:00:24.830> themes<00:00:25.160> which<00:00:25.370> you<00:00:25.490> shouldn't

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
volatile themes which you shouldn't

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.320

milliliters in that robbery more than

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.030 
milliliters in that robbery more than
we'll<00:00:41.360> need<00:00:41.630> for<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:42.290> venture<00:00:43.360> okay<00:00:44.829> but<00:00:45.829> put

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
we'll need for one venture okay but put

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.680 
we'll need for one venture okay but put
40<00:00:46.460> milliliters<00:00:47.020> into<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.210> mixing<00:00:50.210> vessel

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
40 milliliters into the mixing vessel

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.930 
40 milliliters into the mixing vessel
that<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.320> heaters<00:00:52.540> into<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:54.460> mixing<00:00:55.460> vessel

that is heaters into the mixing vessel

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.960 
that is heaters into the mixing vessel
that<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.570> he<00:00:57.200> cured<00:00:57.530> monomer<00:00:57.980> I'm<00:00:58.579> going<00:00:58.910> to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
that is he cured monomer I'm going to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.910 
that is he cured monomer I'm going to
add<00:00:59.149> powder<00:00:59.450> there<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.720> a<00:00:59.809> mixing<00:01:00.260> ratio<00:01:00.710> which

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
add powder there is a mixing ratio which

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.970 
add powder there is a mixing ratio which
you<00:01:01.070> can<00:01:01.250> refer<00:01:01.399> to<00:01:01.579> in<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.570> instructions<00:01:03.260> in

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
you can refer to in the instructions in

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.860 
you can refer to in the instructions in
the<00:01:04.540> cupboard<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:06.380> essentially<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
the cupboard but essentially the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.120 
the cupboard but essentially the
old-school<00:01:08.870> old-fashioned<00:01:09.740> way<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:09.890> mixing

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
old-school old-fashioned way of mixing

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.940 
old-school old-fashioned way of mixing
is<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.580> add<00:01:11.049> polymer<00:01:12.049> until<00:01:12.890> no<00:01:13.159> more<00:01:13.420> knitting

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
is to add polymer until no more knitting

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.730 
is to add polymer until no more knitting
until<00:01:15.950> no<00:01:16.340> more<00:01:19.630> monomer<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.810> saturated<00:01:21.530> by

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
until no more monomer is saturated by

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.630 
until no more monomer is saturated by
the<00:01:21.799> polymer<00:01:25.420> there's<00:01:26.420> some<00:01:26.600> continuing

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
the polymer there's some continuing

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.649 
the polymer there's some continuing
again<00:01:28.640> that's<00:01:28.850> probably<00:01:28.970> more<00:01:29.299> than<00:01:29.510> whether

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
again that's probably more than whether

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.420 
again that's probably more than whether
that's<00:01:30.110> really<00:01:30.260> enough<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.619> do<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.920> dentures

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
that's really enough to do to dentures

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.830 
that's really enough to do to dentures
with<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.450> would<00:01:32.570> maybe<00:01:32.930> half<00:01:33.229> being<00:01:33.619> a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
with so it would maybe half being a

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.350 
with so it would maybe half being a
mixture<00:01:35.840> maybe<00:01:36.680> 20<00:01:37.100> milliliters<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.760> going

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
mixture maybe 20 milliliters is going

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.800 
mixture maybe 20 milliliters is going
from<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:38.930> denture

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.740 

okay<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:51.080> no<00:01:52.080> more<00:01:52.580> parties<00:01:53.580> before<00:01:53.940> no<00:01:54.570> more

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
okay so no more parties before no more

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.920 
okay so no more parties before no more
liquid<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.170> absorbed<00:01:55.290> by<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> pounder

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.700 

okay<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.170> cover<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.340> leave<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:03.710> say

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
okay you cover that and leave it for say

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.090 
okay you cover that and leave it for say
about<00:02:04.920> 10<00:02:05.130> minutes<00:02:05.400> or<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.530> okay<00:02:07.530> pause<00:02:08.070> it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
about 10 minutes or so okay pause it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.490 
about 10 minutes or so okay pause it
there
