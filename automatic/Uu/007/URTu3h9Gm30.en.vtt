you're you're coming up against

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
you're you're coming up against
unstoppable<00:01:33.090> forces<00:01:33.360> essentially<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
unstoppable forces essentially but you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.390 
unstoppable forces essentially but you
can<00:01:34.740> stop<00:01:35.040> them<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> cooperate<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> you

can stop them if you cooperate so you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
can stop them if you cooperate so you
cooperate<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.270> ways<00:01:39.479> than<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.780> killing

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
cooperate in more ways than just killing

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.289 
cooperate in more ways than just killing
more<00:01:41.159> ways<00:01:41.310> than<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.490> killing<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
more ways than just killing so you have

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
more ways than just killing so you have
things<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.020> boosts<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.950> things<00:01:44.159> where

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
things like boosts you have things where

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.940 
things like boosts you have things where
your<00:01:45.299> partner<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.439> partners<00:01:46.619> might

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
partner you have a revived system so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.149 
partner you have a revived system so
