much<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.280> than<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> game

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570

which<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> awesome<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.079> everything<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.500> it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
which is awesome and everything but it's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
which is awesome and everything but it's
more<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> an<00:00:41.280> action<00:00:41.579> game<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.600> safely<00:00:42.870> say

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
