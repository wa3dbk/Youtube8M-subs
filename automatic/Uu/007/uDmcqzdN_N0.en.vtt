00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
this circle here and here and it's a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.060 
this circle here and here and it's a
mirrored<00:01:31.810> back<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.650> give<00:01:32.799> you<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> quick

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
second to glimpse at that super super

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.060 
second to glimpse at that super super
cool<00:01:34.900> I<00:01:34.960> like<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.470> same<00:01:35.770> as<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.010> original

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
cool I like that same as the original

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.899 
cool I like that same as the original
and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.140> pattern<00:01:38.500> continues<00:01:38.890> inside<00:01:39.460> and

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
and then a pattern continues inside and

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.480 
and then a pattern continues inside and
on<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.390> flap<00:01:40.690> there<00:01:40.930> when<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.320> has<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> black<00:01:41.770> or

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
on the flap there when it has a black or

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.670 
on the flap there when it has a black or
it<00:01:42.549> doesn't<00:01:42.670> have<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:42.970> doesn't<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.780> steel

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
it doesn't have it doesn't have a steel

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.609 
it doesn't have it doesn't have a steel
okay<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.540> let's<00:01:46.720> take<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:46.990> rest<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.320> cards

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
okay so let's take the rest of the cards

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.240 
okay so let's take the rest of the cards
out<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.909> first<00:01:49.090> off<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.540> cards<00:01:49.960> obviously<00:01:50.619> are

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
out so first off the cards obviously are

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.719 
out so first off the cards obviously are
all<00:01:51.850> custom<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:53.799> most<00:01:54.010> of<00:01:54.130> them<00:01:54.310> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
all custom or so most of them the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.149 
all custom or so most of them the
royalty<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.180> stuff<00:01:55.479> are<00:01:56.140> basically<00:01:56.740> standard

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
what I like

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.400 
what I like
then<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.569> have<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.720> Jack<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.079> Queen<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
then you have the Jack the Queen the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.589 
then you have the Jack the Queen the
King<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.220> they<00:03:28.519> actually<00:03:28.670> have<00:03:28.910> no<00:03:29.239> mount

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
King and they actually have no mount

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.330 
King and they actually have no mount
whatsoever<00:03:30.200> there<00:03:30.319> is<00:03:30.410> no<00:03:30.680> mouth<00:03:30.980> on<00:03:31.220> them

whatsoever there is no mouth on them
what's<00:03:31.700> over<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.329> think<00:03:32.510> that's<00:03:32.660> something

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
what's over and I think that's something

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.900 
what's over and I think that's something
that<00:03:33.379> makes<00:03:33.530> her<00:03:33.620> stand<00:03:33.890> out<00:03:34.099> much<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.609> can't

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
that makes her stand out much you can't

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.330 
that makes her stand out much you can't
talk<00:03:35.239> that<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:36.200> heart<00:03:36.440> pattern<00:03:36.769> stands<00:03:37.130> out

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
talk that the heart pattern stands out

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.409 
talk that the heart pattern stands out
more<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.760> know<00:03:37.849> that<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.030> can<00:03:38.150> see<00:03:38.269> there's

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
more you know that you can see there's

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.210

actually<00:03:38.510> texture<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.590> that's<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:40.099> I

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
actually texture to it and that's what I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.979 
actually texture to it and that's what I
like<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.849> little<00:03:41.209> temperature<00:03:41.569> it<00:03:41.720> makes<00:03:41.900> it

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
like the little temperature it makes it

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.659 
like the little temperature it makes it
a<00:03:42.049> little<00:03:42.200> bit<00:03:42.319> more<00:03:42.410> custom<00:03:42.859> than<00:03:43.040> normal<00:03:43.370> and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.240 
the pips in the font they're custom and
it<00:03:48.260> goes<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.500> whole<00:03:48.530> way<00:03:48.680> through<00:03:48.769> just
