find the middle you'll actually have to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.389 
find the middle you'll actually have to
use<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> pin<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> mark<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.219> fabric

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
use a pin and mark it on the fabric

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
use a pin and mark it on the fabric
itself<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.329> find<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> later<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:37.020> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
itself so you can find it later on as

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.910 
itself so you can find it later on as
well<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.910> just<00:00:38.910> put<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.149> through<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.920> then

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
well so just put it through and then

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.900 
well so just put it through and then
again<00:00:41.840> fold<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.020> into<00:00:43.230> half<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
again fold it into half so that's the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.569 
again fold it into half so that's the
middle<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.160> any<00:00:47.309> type<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
middle right there it can be any type of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.450 
middle right there it can be any type of
fabric<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.570> thinner<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> be

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
fabric the thinner it is you have to be

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760 
fabric the thinner it is you have to be
more<00:00:50.640> patient<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.149> sewing<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.379> otherwise

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
more patient when sewing but otherwise

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.209 
more patient when sewing but otherwise
it<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.430> thick<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.090> thin<00:00:54.350> fabric<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.890> here

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it can be thick or thin fabric so here

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.090 
it can be thick or thin fabric so here
again<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> ends<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> scarf<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> put

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a pin through those as well so you have

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
a pin through those as well so you have
one<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> middle<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> end

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
one now in the middle and one at the end

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.700 
one now in the middle and one at the end

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so all the way through to the end

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.609

side and again make sure you take the
middle<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.490> side<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.509> measure<00:02:06.899> 22

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
middle and one side of it so measure 22

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339 
middle and one side of it so measure 22
centimetres<00:02:08.429> 48.6<00:02:09.119> inches<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
centimetres 48.6 inches that will be the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.990 
centimetres 48.6 inches that will be the
hole<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.250> arms

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
hole for your arms

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
hole for your arms
and<00:02:12.090> again<00:02:12.870> put<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.170> push<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> pin<00:02:13.770> through<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and again put it push a pin through the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.570 
and again put it push a pin through the
exact<00:02:16.020> distance<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.740> know<00:02:16.890> where<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.310> sew

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
exact distance so you know where to sew

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.600 
exact distance so you know where to sew
and<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.630> same<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> other<00:02:19.140> side<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.890> both

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and the same on the other side so both

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.550 
and the same on the other side so both
on<00:02:20.940> both<00:02:21.090> sides<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.930> were<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.260> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
on both sides and you were just so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.280 
on both sides and you were just so
basically<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:24.150> piece<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.750> middle

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
basically the piece in the middle

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.330 
basically the piece in the middle
so<00:02:25.860> again<00:02:26.070> pin<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> together<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:27.300> some<00:02:27.570> pins

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
so again pin it together with some pins

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.460 
so again pin it together with some pins
make<00:02:29.340> sure<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.290> exactly

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
make sure you do it so you know exactly

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710 
make sure you do it so you know exactly
where<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.430> make<00:02:33.060> sure<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.360> leave<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
where it is so make sure you leave the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
where it is so make sure you leave the
holes<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.230> arm<00:02:34.410> three<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.700> start

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
holes for the arm three so now you start

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.140 
holes for the arm three so now you start
sewing<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.750> again<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.190> row<00:02:38.400> make<00:02:38.970> sure

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
sewing and again just in a row make sure

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.030 
sewing and again just in a row make sure
you<00:02:39.270> pull<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> fabric<00:02:39.810> through<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you pull the fabric through so it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.350 
you pull the fabric through so it
doesn't<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:43.260> wonky<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.550> go<00:02:44.760> just
