actually use much in Minecraft which is
really<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.409> awesome<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.700> gold<00:01:17.970> ingot

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
really really awesome and one gold ingot

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.850 
really really awesome and one gold ingot
in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> middle<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.140> how<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.590> your

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
in the middle so this is how you do your

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
in the middle so this is how you do your
hash<00:01:20.400> packer<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> next<00:01:22.170> one

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hash packer here and then the next one

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
hash packer here and then the next one
is<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.830> basic<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> corner<00:01:23.939> marker<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
is the basic or the corner marker and so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
is the basic or the corner marker and so
just<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> basic<00:01:25.080> corner<00:01:25.320> marker<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> only

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
just the basic corner marker the only

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.870 
just the basic corner marker the only
reason<00:01:26.159> why<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.310> calling<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> basically

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
reason why I'm calling it basically

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
reason why I'm calling it basically
because<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.479> an<00:01:27.570> advanced<00:01:28.020> version<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
because it's like an advanced version of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
because it's like an advanced version of
it<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> could<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.729> as

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it and this one you could use it like as

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.100 
it and this one you could use it like as
much<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.360> want<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
much as you want but this one here you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960 
much as you want but this one here you
can<00:01:31.229> only<00:01:31.350> use<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.530> once<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.790> how<00:01:32.909> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
can only use it once so this is how you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
can only use it once so this is how you
actually<00:01:33.180> cross<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.200> explain

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
actually cross it and I'm gonna explain

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
actually cross it and I'm gonna explain
it<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.740> more<00:01:34.799> details<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.759> second<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.479> glass

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it in more details in a second so glass

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
it in more details in a second so glass
in<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> middle<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.409> sorry<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.979> iron<00:01:38.189> ingots

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
in the middle like sorry for iron ingots

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.069 
in the middle like sorry for iron ingots
on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> side<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> corners<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
on the side on the corners and this is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
on the side on the corners and this is
pretty<00:01:40.259> much<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.560> craft<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> next

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
pretty much how you craft it so the next

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.179 
pretty much how you craft it so the next
one<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.840> advanced<00:01:43.320> air<00:01:43.409> corner<00:01:43.770> marker<00:01:44.070> as

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
one is the advanced air corner marker as

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
one is the advanced air corner marker as
you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> costs<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> craft<00:01:45.600> for

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you can see it costs more to craft for

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.560 
you can see it costs more to craft for
and<00:01:46.110> diamonds<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.950> 4<00:01:47.220> gold<00:01:47.640> ingots<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and diamonds at 4 gold ingots and the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
and diamonds at 4 gold ingots and the
corner<00:01:48.899> mark<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.320> basic<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
corner mark at the basic one in the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
corner mark at the basic one in the
middle<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> deserve

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
middle but you know I think you deserve

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.670 
middle but you know I think you deserve
it<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:51.899> you're<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.439> able<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it because you're going to be able to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.319 
it because you're going to be able to
use<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> unlimited<00:01:53.520> amount<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.939> times<00:01:54.090> which

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
use the unlimited amount of times which

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
use the unlimited amount of times which
is<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.810> super<00:01:54.960> freaking<00:01:55.320> epic<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is going to be super freaking epic and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.149 
is going to be super freaking epic and
cool<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> final<00:01:58.290> things<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.619> how<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> make

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
cool and the final things is how to make

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
cool and the final things is how to make
your<00:01:59.369> blueprint<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.119> any<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:00.540> through

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
your blueprint so any of these through

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810 
your blueprint so any of these through
here<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> blueprint<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.369> only<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> do

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
here so a blueprint you only have to do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.179 
here so a blueprint you only have to do
just<00:02:02.969> place<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.659> piece<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.560> lapies<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
just place down a piece of lapies and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.039 
just place down a piece of lapies and
paper<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> think<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.840> time<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
paper so I think now it's time to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
paper so I think now it's time to
demonstrate<00:02:07.560> how<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> mod<00:02:08.160> works<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.700> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
demonstrate how this mod works and you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.400 
demonstrate how this mod works and you
know<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.720> example<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> play<00:02:10.319> in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
know if for example if you play in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.839 
know if for example if you play in
Minecraft<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.009> after<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> while<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
Minecraft and after a while you kind of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
Minecraft and after a while you kind of
get<00:02:12.030> bored<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.390> warehouses<00:02:13.080> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
get bored of warehouses and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.050 
get bored of warehouses and
probably<00:02:13.860> move<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.190> into<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.460> new<00:02:14.610> biome<00:02:14.910> or

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
probably move it into a new biome or

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.460 
probably move it into a new biome or
something<00:02:15.270> like<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.900> example<00:02:15.990> here

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
something like this for example here

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.870 
something like this for example here
like<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:16.980> hands<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.430> little<00:02:17.730> here

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
like I have my hands in this little here

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.910 
like I have my hands in this little here
which<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> looking<00:02:18.780> amazing<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.560> views<00:02:19.740> are

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
which is looking amazing the views are

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.950 
which is looking amazing the views are
super<00:02:20.340> freaking<00:02:20.610> epic<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.150> I'm<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
know I think I've had enough it's time

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.160 
know I think I've had enough it's time
to<00:02:23.790> move<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> somewhere<00:02:24.450> else<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.870> after

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
to move it to somewhere else so after

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.380 
to move it to somewhere else so after
you<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.950> my<00:02:26.250> house<00:02:26.520> back<00:02:26.550> after<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> sit

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390

try<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.550> make<00:02:47.850> sure<00:02:48.030> mark<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> whole<00:02:48.780> place

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
try to make sure mark in the whole place

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470 
try to make sure mark in the whole place
so<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:50.010> example<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.460> this<00:02:50.730> side<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.330> I'm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
so for example in this side here all I'm

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.180 
so for example in this side here all I'm
gonna<00:02:51.600> do<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.900> come<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.530> corner<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
gonna do is come to this corner here and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.800 
gonna do is come to this corner here and
yeah<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.090> should<00:02:54.240> cover<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> whole

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
yeah this is should cover the whole

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.050 
yeah this is should cover the whole
house<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.320> then<00:02:55.440> place<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.770> down<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:56.910> I'm

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
house and then place this down so if I'm

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.880 
house and then place this down so if I'm
actually<00:02:57.270> doing<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.900> survival<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.680> would

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
actually doing this in survival I would

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.370 
actually doing this in survival I would
only<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.220> able<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.640> use<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.060> once<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.140> for

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
only be able to use this once so for

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.350 
only be able to use this once so for
example<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.040> was<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.430> survival<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.240> I'm

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
example if I was in survival and I'm

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.940

because<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.320> think<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.740> mod<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.070> still<00:03:35.250> under

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
because I think this mod is still under

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.680 
because I think this mod is still under
development<00:03:35.610> hopefully<00:03:36.270> they're<00:03:36.390> gonna<00:03:36.480> get

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
development hopefully they're gonna get

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.449 
development hopefully they're gonna get
it<00:03:36.810> all<00:03:36.930> fixed<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.410> working<00:03:37.920> perfectly

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
it all fixed and working perfectly

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.310 
it all fixed and working perfectly
so<00:03:38.670> Adam<00:03:39.120> Emily's<00:03:39.360> little<00:03:39.570> bit<00:03:39.660> glitchy<00:03:39.870> but

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
so Adam Emily's little bit glitchy but

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.390 
so Adam Emily's little bit glitchy but
that<00:03:40.530> could<00:03:40.709> work<00:03:40.830> for<00:03:40.980> your<00:03:41.070> own<00:03:41.160> advantage

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
that could work for your own advantage

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
she could you know double all the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.900 
she could you know double all the
amounts<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:44.700> which<00:03:44.880> you

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
amounts of you know I think which you

fine<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.440> suppose<00:05:25.620> when<00:05:25.979> you<00:05:26.010> even<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.370> huge

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
fine I suppose when you even a huge

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.219 
fine I suppose when you even a huge
house<00:05:26.940> if<00:05:27.210> from<00:05:27.389> one<00:05:27.570> place<00:05:27.780> into<00:05:28.020> another

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
house if from one place into another

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.659 
house if from one place into another
because<00:05:28.710> trust<00:05:28.979> me<00:05:29.039> don't<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.400> probably

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
because trust me don't have probably

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.100 
because trust me don't have probably
rebuild<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.270> whole<00:05:30.419> things<00:05:30.600> again<00:05:30.870> it's

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
rebuild the whole things again it's

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.440 
rebuild the whole things again it's
still<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:32.070> lot<00:05:32.310> easier<00:05:32.729> just<00:05:32.760> moving<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.389> from

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
still a lot easier just moving it from

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.779 
still a lot easier just moving it from
one<00:05:33.539> place<00:05:33.870> into<00:05:34.229> another<00:05:34.560> and<00:05:35.010> as<00:05:35.460> well<00:05:35.639> in

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
one place into another and as well in

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.610 
one place into another and as well in
survival<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.570> forgot<00:05:36.870> about<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.169> mention<00:05:37.289> this

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
survival I forgot about to mention this

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.890 
survival I forgot about to mention this
you<00:05:38.070> can<00:05:38.250> actually<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.610> break<00:05:39.000> this<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.389> move

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
you can actually a break this and move

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.570 
you can actually a break this and move
it<00:05:40.050> with<00:05:40.260> you<00:05:40.349> from<00:05:40.500> one<00:05:40.710> place<00:05:40.740> into<00:05:41.340> another

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
it with you from one place into another

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.450 
it with you from one place into another
as<00:05:41.760> well<00:05:42.000> which<00:05:42.180> is<00:05:42.300> really<00:05:42.330> really<00:05:42.690> epic<00:05:42.930> and

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
as well which is really really epic and

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.740 
as well which is really really epic and
anyway<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.490> could<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:44.910> now<00:05:45.030> place<00:05:45.330> this<00:05:45.510> down

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
anyway I could just now place this down

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.750 
anyway I could just now place this down
and<00:05:45.990> then<00:05:46.200> use<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.560> blueprint<00:05:46.919> again<00:05:47.220> but<00:05:47.639> if

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
and then use the blueprint again but if

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.339 
and then use the blueprint again but if
you<00:05:47.849> were<00:05:47.970> in<00:05:48.060> survival<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.720> once<00:05:48.960> again<00:05:49.110> you

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
you were in survival and once again you

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.900 
you were in survival and once again you
could<00:05:49.440> only<00:05:49.620> use<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:50.099> at<00:05:50.310> once<00:05:50.520> you<00:05:50.639> can<00:05:50.760> only

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
could only use this at once you can only

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.790 
could only use this at once you can only
use<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.240> blueprint<00:05:51.599> once<00:05:52.169> I'm<00:05:52.440> gonna<00:05:52.560> just

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
use the blueprint once I'm gonna just

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.770 
use the blueprint once I'm gonna just
ask<00:05:52.979> them<00:05:53.160> straight<00:05:53.460> quickly<00:05:53.820> in<00:05:53.940> here<00:05:54.240> let<00:05:54.720> me

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
ask them straight quickly in here let me

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.409 
ask them straight quickly in here let me
just<00:05:54.960> place<00:05:55.139> this<00:05:55.289> down<00:05:55.560> here<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:57.270> is

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
just place this down here and this is

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.300 
just place this down here and this is
the<00:05:57.539> blueprint<00:05:57.960> which<00:05:58.139> I<00:05:58.289> have<00:05:58.560> if<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.919> just<00:05:59.160> use

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
the blueprint which I have if I just use

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.950 
the blueprint which I have if I just use
it<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.520> see<00:05:59.669> it's<00:05:59.789> gone<00:06:00.000> I've<00:06:00.330> got<00:06:00.570> no<00:06:00.720> other

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
it I see it's gone I've got no other

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.420 
it I see it's gone I've got no other
copy<00:06:01.229> of<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:01.680> make<00:06:01.919> sure<00:06:01.949> when<00:06:02.400> you

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
copy of it so make sure when you

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.860 
copy of it so make sure when you
actually<00:06:02.550> play<00:06:02.789> this<00:06:02.940> in<00:06:03.090> survival<00:06:03.449> Azur<00:06:03.690> not

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
actually play this in survival Azur not

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.290 
actually play this in survival Azur not
to<00:06:04.020> die<00:06:04.169> because<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:05.580> just<00:06:05.820> gonna<00:06:06.000> lose<00:06:06.180> your

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
to die because you just gonna lose your

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.879 
to die because you just gonna lose your
blue<00:06:06.539> blueprint<00:06:07.110> and<00:06:07.260> then<00:06:07.380> it's<00:06:07.560> gonna<00:06:07.710> be<00:06:07.860> a

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
blue blueprint and then it's gonna be a

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.400 
blue blueprint and then it's gonna be a
huge<00:06:08.280> huge<00:06:09.120> of<00:06:09.419> problem<00:06:09.780> so<00:06:09.930> make<00:06:10.139> sure<00:06:10.169> you

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
huge huge of problem so make sure you

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.800 
huge huge of problem so make sure you
don't<00:06:10.560> actually<00:06:10.830> lose<00:06:11.099> your<00:06:11.419> blueprint<00:06:12.419> while

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
don't actually lose your blueprint while

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.360 
don't actually lose your blueprint while
you<00:06:13.020> actually<00:06:13.320> traveling<00:06:13.800> from<00:06:13.979> one<00:06:14.160> place

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
you actually traveling from one place

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.339 
you actually traveling from one place
into<00:06:14.699> another<00:06:14.970> and<00:06:15.300> especially<00:06:15.539> don't<00:06:16.169> die

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
into another and especially don't die

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.080 
into another and especially don't die
because<00:06:16.560> if<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:16.919> do<00:06:17.130> you<00:06:17.760> might<00:06:17.940> just

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
because if you do you might just

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.460 
because if you do you might just
completely<00:06:18.479> lose<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.780> especially<00:06:19.199> if<00:06:19.380> you

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
completely lose it especially if you

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.560 
completely lose it especially if you
actually<00:06:19.740> fall<00:06:19.889> down<00:06:19.919> in<00:06:20.310> lava<00:06:20.550> so<00:06:21.180> this<00:06:21.419> is

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
actually fall down in lava so this is

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.000 
actually fall down in lava so this is
very<00:06:21.780> much<00:06:21.870> how<00:06:22.050> you<00:06:22.080> use<00:06:22.320> it<00:06:22.440> for<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.650> basic

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
very much how you use it for the basic

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.620 
very much how you use it for the basic
of<00:06:23.130> moving<00:06:23.490> houses<00:06:23.760> from<00:06:24.120> one<00:06:24.270> place<00:06:24.479> at

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
of moving houses from one place at

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.750 
of moving houses from one place at
another<00:06:24.750> but<00:06:25.199> I<00:06:25.470> thought<00:06:26.010> about<00:06:26.190> a<00:06:26.280> different

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
another but I thought about a different

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.820 
another but I thought about a different
way<00:06:26.789> of<00:06:26.849> using<00:06:27.000> this<00:06:27.360> in<00:06:27.539> survival<00:06:28.199> so<00:06:28.500> many<00:06:28.710> of

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
way of using this in survival so many of

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.830 
way of using this in survival so many of
us<00:06:28.889> always<00:06:29.220> wanted<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.550> kind<00:06:29.729> of<00:06:29.789> Croft<00:06:30.120> much

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
us always wanted to kind of Croft much

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.230 
us always wanted to kind of Croft much
smaller<00:06:31.169> so<00:06:31.410> in<00:06:31.560> this<00:06:31.830> gobies<00:06:32.669> just<00:06:32.910> super

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
smaller so in this gobies just super

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.610 
smaller so in this gobies just super
freaking<00:06:33.510> epic<00:06:33.690> I'm<00:06:33.780> gonna<00:06:33.960> just<00:06:34.380> drag
