00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like Venus or typing a lot better it can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.810

starter Blaziken already has a mega
evolution<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.380> why<00:02:45.650> doesn't<00:02:46.010> Swampert<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.700> a

mega<00:02:46.940> evolution<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.480> course<00:02:48.280> why<00:02:49.280> doesn't<00:02:49.610> he

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
mega evolution of course why doesn't he

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.100 
mega evolution of course why doesn't he
have<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.820> mega<00:02:50.060> evolution<00:02:50.480> why<00:02:50.630> doesn't<00:02:50.930> skip

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
have a mega evolution why doesn't skip

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.260 
have a mega evolution why doesn't skip
to<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> mega<00:02:51.590> evolution<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.160> mean<00:02:52.340> these<00:02:53.000> of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
to have a mega evolution I mean these of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.000 
to have a mega evolution I mean these of
course<00:02:53.510> our<00:02:53.690> own<00:02:53.870> remakes<00:02:54.320> if<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.709> was<00:02:54.860> like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
course our own remakes if this was like

sinner remix or anything like that then

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.000 
sinner remix or anything like that then
you<00:02:56.660> don't<00:02:56.690> necessarily<00:02:56.959> need<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.650> mega

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you don't necessarily need to have mega

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.949 
you don't necessarily need to have mega
evolutions<00:02:58.459> for<00:02:58.640> those<00:02:58.760> guys<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.360> it'd<00:02:59.900> be

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
evolutions for those guys but it'd be

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.300 
evolutions for those guys but it'd be
kind<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.470> weird<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.010> be<00:03:01.130> able<00:03:01.220> to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
kind of just weird to like be able to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.830 
kind of just weird to like be able to
play<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.670> game<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> lot<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.270> people<00:03:02.510> would<00:03:02.600> make

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
play the game a lot of people would make

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.540 
play the game a lot of people would make
you<00:03:02.990> prefer<00:03:03.350> Blaziken<00:03:03.860> over<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> other<00:03:04.400> guys

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you prefer Blaziken over the other guys

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.310 
you prefer Blaziken over the other guys
if<00:03:04.820> Blaziken<00:03:05.300> was<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.510> only<00:03:05.690> one<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.170> have<00:03:06.260> a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
if Blaziken was the only one to have a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.440 
if Blaziken was the only one to have a
mega<00:03:06.530> evolution<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.910> really<00:03:08.150> want<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.390> see

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
mega evolution so you really want to see

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.240 
mega evolution so you really want to see
like<00:03:09.020> both<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.320> these<00:03:09.560> guys<00:03:09.800> have<00:03:10.040> mega

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
like both of these guys have mega

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.920 
like both of these guys have mega
evolutions<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.940> definitely<00:03:11.510> look<00:03:11.690> pretty

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
evolutions and definitely look pretty

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.080 
evolutions and definitely look pretty
cool<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.380> think<00:03:13.190> Swampert<00:03:13.610> would<00:03:13.820> just<00:03:14.000> be

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
cool I think Swampert would just be

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.540 
cool I think Swampert would just be
extremely<00:03:14.690> bulky<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.890> might<00:03:16.160> even<00:03:16.310> have

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
extremely bulky on it might even have

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.970 
extremely bulky on it might even have
SAT<00:03:16.760> zipper<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.510> did<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.350> world<00:03:18.709> would

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
SAT zipper if it did the world would

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.330 
SAT zipper if it did the world would
probably<00:03:19.640> explode<00:03:20.420> but<00:03:21.290> that'd<00:03:21.680> be<00:03:21.830> okay<00:03:22.070> so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
probably explode but that'd be okay so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.040 
probably explode but that'd be okay so
yeah<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.730> really<00:03:26.120> think<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.510> if<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.870> were

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
yeah I just really think that if it were

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.270 
yeah I just really think that if it were
to<00:03:27.170> get<00:03:27.260> sep<00:03:27.440> supernova<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.070> would<00:03:28.190> be

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
to get sep supernova it would be

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.850 
to get sep supernova it would be
extremely<00:03:28.930> extremely<00:03:29.930> bulky<00:03:30.380> feeling

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
extremely extremely bulky feeling

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.350 
extremely extremely bulky feeling
powerful<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.459> very<00:03:31.640> hard<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.030> take<00:03:32.180> down

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
powerful and very hard to take down

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.449 
powerful and very hard to take down
maybe<00:03:32.989> again<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.500> Venus<00:03:33.920> or<00:03:34.070> something<00:03:34.370> like

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
maybe again like Venus or something like

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.009 
maybe again like Venus or something like
that<00:03:34.519> doesn't<00:03:35.150> really<00:03:35.330> have<00:03:35.480> much<00:03:35.510> in<00:03:35.810> terms

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
that doesn't really have much in terms

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.900 
that doesn't really have much in terms
of<00:03:36.200> recovery<00:03:36.470> but<00:03:36.890> still<00:03:37.160> be<00:03:37.370> extremely

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
of recovery but still be extremely

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.030 
of recovery but still be extremely
powerful<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.720> then<00:03:39.590> I'm<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.830> get<00:03:39.950> to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
powerful and then I'm going to get to

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.420 
powerful and then I'm going to get to
number<00:03:40.130> 1<00:03:40.280> like<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.820> said<00:03:40.880> sceptile<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:43.160> thing

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
number 1 like I said sceptile this thing

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.270 
number 1 like I said sceptile this thing
definitely<00:03:44.090> if<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.780> know<00:03:45.110> mega<00:03:45.650> Blaziken<00:03:45.800> is

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
definitely if you know mega Blaziken is

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.520 
definitely if you know mega Blaziken is
going<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.519> be<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.640> thing<00:03:46.910> then<00:03:47.480> mega<00:03:48.080> Swampert

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
going to be a thing then mega Swampert

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.960 
going to be a thing then mega Swampert
and<00:03:48.680> make<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.800> sceptile<00:03:49.220> should<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.519> things<00:03:49.760> as

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
and make a sceptile should be things as

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.840 
and make a sceptile should be things as
to<00:03:50.150> um<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:51.019> could<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.470> be<00:03:51.590> seeing<00:03:52.489> maybe

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
to um I could just be seeing maybe

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.449 
to um I could just be seeing maybe
sceptile<00:03:53.360> maybe<00:03:53.750> Bryce<00:03:54.590> dragon<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.190> don't<00:03:55.370> know

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
sceptile maybe Bryce dragon I don't know

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.830 
sceptile maybe Bryce dragon I don't know
I<00:03:55.610> really<00:03:55.820> don't<00:03:55.940> think<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.450> would<00:03:56.540> be<00:03:56.630> brash

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
I really don't think it would be brash

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.690 
I really don't think it would be brash
dragon<00:03:57.230> but<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.530> does<00:03:57.709> have<00:03:57.890> access<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.370> dragon

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
dragon but it does have access to dragon

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.460 
dragon but it does have access to dragon

pools and stuff like that although like

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.840 
pools and stuff like that although like
a<00:04:00.500> few<00:04:00.769> grass<00:04:00.980> types<00:04:01.250> here<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.519> there<00:04:01.640> due<00:04:01.820> to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
a few grass types here and there due to

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.840 
a few grass types here and there due to
um<00:04:02.269> I'm<00:04:03.260> not<00:04:03.440> exactly<00:04:03.709> sure<00:04:03.980> if<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.519> were<00:04:04.610> get<00:04:04.820> a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
um I'm not exactly sure if it were get a

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.460 
um I'm not exactly sure if it were get a
second<00:04:05.209> typing<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.660> might<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.050> stay<00:04:06.290> with

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
second typing and might just stay with

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.920 
second typing and might just stay with
grass<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:07.010> know<00:04:07.670> of<00:04:07.880> course<00:04:08.030> grass<00:04:08.390> dragon<00:04:08.810> like

I<00:04:09.049> said<00:04:09.230> there's<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.470> little<00:04:09.620> bit<00:04:09.769> absurd<00:04:10.100> and

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
I said there's a little bit absurd and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.880 
I said there's a little bit absurd and
stuff<00:04:11.000> but<00:04:11.540> i<00:04:11.870> don't<00:04:12.110> know<00:04:12.200> i<00:04:12.230> think<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.650> looks

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
stuff but i don't know i think it looks

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.370 
stuff but i don't know i think it looks
pretty<00:04:12.980> cool<00:04:13.549> also<00:04:14.209> some<00:04:14.450> stings<00:04:14.900> about

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
pretty cool also some stings about

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.710 
pretty cool also some stings about
sceptile<00:04:15.950> as<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.310> why<00:04:16.549> it's<00:04:16.850> number<00:04:17.060> one<00:04:17.479> and

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
sceptile as to why it's number one and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.320 
sceptile as to why it's number one and
why<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.169> not<00:04:18.350> tied<00:04:18.890> with<00:04:19.609> Swampert<00:04:20.180> is

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
why it's not tied with Swampert is

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.029 
why it's not tied with Swampert is
because<00:04:20.900> remember<00:04:21.140> like<00:04:21.410> maybe<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.739> couple<00:04:21.950> of

that like you knows Kyogre groudon or

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.830 
that like you knows Kyogre groudon or
quaza<00:04:56.639> although<00:04:57.060> they<00:04:57.210> probably<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.569> you

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
quaza although they probably just you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.269 
quaza although they probably just you
know<00:04:57.960> register<00:04:58.319> those<00:04:58.529> trademarks<00:04:59.039> just

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
know register those trademarks just

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.320 
know register those trademarks just
because<00:04:59.460> they're<00:04:59.580> going<00:04:59.699> to<00:04:59.759> be<00:04:59.849> new<00:05:00.000> forms

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
because they're going to be new forms

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.089 
because they're going to be new forms
and<00:05:00.509> stuff<00:05:00.599> like<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:00.810> not<00:05:01.620> necessarily

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
and stuff like that not necessarily

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.559 
and stuff like that not necessarily
they're<00:05:02.400> going<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.580> be<00:05:02.669> new<00:05:02.849> mega<00:05:03.060> evolutions

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
they're going to be new mega evolutions

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.439 
they're going to be new mega evolutions
but<00:05:03.689> I<00:05:03.719> definitely<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.439> sceptile<00:05:04.949> and

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
but I definitely see sceptile and

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.689 
but I definitely see sceptile and
swampert<00:05:06.449> being<00:05:06.719> mega<00:05:07.110> evolutions<00:05:07.710> but<00:05:08.009> if<00:05:08.219> it

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
swampert being mega evolutions but if it

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.969 
swampert being mega evolutions but if it
really<00:05:09.000> comes<00:05:09.180> down<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.560> everything<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.740> mean

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
really comes down to everything I mean

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.890 
really comes down to everything I mean
Sceptile<00:05:11.669> has<00:05:11.789> a<00:05:11.819> better<00:05:12.000> chance<00:05:12.090> because<00:05:12.479> it

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
Sceptile has a better chance because it

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.839 
Sceptile has a better chance because it
has<00:05:13.469> a<00:05:13.500> registered<00:05:13.979> trademark<00:05:14.159> or<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.699> has<00:05:14.819> a

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849
