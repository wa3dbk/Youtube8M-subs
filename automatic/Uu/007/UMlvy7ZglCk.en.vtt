time with my fingers bleeding literally
with<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.900> call<00:02:03.200> splitting<00:02:03.710> your<00:02:03.830> hands<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
with the call splitting your hands and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.330 
with the call splitting your hands and
your<00:02:04.369> scheme<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:06.110> that's<00:02:06.440> starting<00:02:06.979> from

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
your scheme and that's starting from

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.940 
your scheme and that's starting from
basics<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.269> I<00:02:08.840> think<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.379> think<00:02:09.619> that's<00:02:09.739> been

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
basics and I think I think that's been

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.920 
basics and I think I think that's been
the<00:02:09.979> biggest<00:02:10.220> success<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:11.000> actually<00:02:11.150> get

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
the biggest success is to actually get

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.339 
the biggest success is to actually get
