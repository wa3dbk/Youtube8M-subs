00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:12.200
Nobody knows exactly
how long the islanders have eaten cheese.

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:16.767
Probably since the first cow
was milked on Saaremaa

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.856
and the milk turned into curd.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:29.267
Production of cheese on Saaremaa
was first mentioned in records in 1843.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.533
The first cheesery was in Tõlluste.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.719
Production of cheese on Saaremaa
was developed by Mr. Schlup,

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.161
a man with Swiss roots and
experience.

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:45.497
AS Saaremaa Piimatööstus is owned

00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:48.156
by the members of the
local milk cooperation.

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:55.605
In 2011 the members of the cooperation
had 5000 cows in total.

00:00:55.807 --> 00:00:58.872
Milk is collected in modern
milk tank trucks.

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:04.357
The trucks are equipped with computers
that register the temperature

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:10.095
and amount of the milk and forward
the information to the dairy.

00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:12.843
The quality of the collected milk is checked

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.815
in the lab, before it is accepted
for processing.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:18.985
The milk is tested for inhibitors.

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:22.567
If there are none,
the milk is suitable for processing.

00:01:23.137 --> 00:01:27.850
Also the fat and protein content

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.826
and the taste of milk
in each truck tank are checked.

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:36.908
The lab of Animal Recording Centre in Tartu
checks the quality of the raw milk,

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:43.105
identifies the amount of microorganisms
and the physical characteristics of the milk.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:47.378
The milk is graded on the basis
of the test results.

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:52.319
In average 96.8% of the collected milk
is of premium grade.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.404
Here is the heart of the dairy...

00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:03.622
the raw milk is pasteurised at +72 degrees

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:07.709
and separated into cream
and skimmed milk.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.000
After separation the milk goes through
the bactofuge, where spores are removed.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They are unwanted in the production of
high-quality cheese.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.192
Cheese milk is prepared in the tank room.

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:27.949
It can accommodate up to 80 tons
of milk at a time.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.815
Cheesery is the most important room
in our dairy.

00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:35.092
Here milk becomes cheese.

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:43.328
We produce different types of cheese:
Tilsiter, Gouda, Edam and Swiss.

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:49.838
Starter culture, rennet and calcium chloride
are added to the cheese milk.

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:54.275
Curd grain is formed in the cheese vat

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:58.993
and fused into cheese
mass in the pre-press.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.292
Finally the cheese is pressed in moulds,
where heads of cheese are shaped.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Cheese is salted in the brine bath
for 12 to 72 hours.

00:03:35.243 --> 00:03:42.662
After that it contains up to 1.4% salt.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Cheese is wrapped in plastic,
weighed and labelled.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Every batch has a unique batch number.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.861
A head of cheese weighs about 15 kg.

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.066
Cheese is ripened minimum
30 days in the cheese cellar.

00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.331
Swiss cheeses ripen a longer time,
3 months to a year.

00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:35.592
There is 400 tons of cheese
in the ripening cellar at a time.

00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:41.735
Big heads of cheese are cut and packaged

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.855
in smaller packs that are convenient to use.

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:48.445
Sliced, cut in blocks or shredded.

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:56.951
The slice line produces
up to 36 packs per minute.

00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:02.482
Slices from such packs
are good for sandwiches.

00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:10.720
The capacity of the flow line
is up to 56 packs per minute.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:19.854
Cheese blocks weighing
350 g to 1 kg are packed here.

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:30.130
Shredded cheese can be used to add
flavour to food, such as pizza.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.467
Maximum 4 kg of cheese
is shredded per minute.

00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:42.333
A new butter line was put in service
in February 2012.

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:48.345
The butter machine produces
1000 kg butter per hour.

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:55.461
We make traditional Estonian butter
with 82% of fat.

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:13.457
Butter with different additives
can be made on the new butter line.

00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:21.909
In 2012 we introduced a new product,
Saaremaa butter with salt crystals.

00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:30.626
We sell about 70% of our products
in home market.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:36.805
The rest is exported to Finland,
Russia and other countries.

00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:47.120
AS Pinus, a subsidiary of
AS Saaremaa Piimatööstus,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.082
was founded in 1997 for
distribution of our products in Estonia.

00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:57.264
This arrangement ensures
that the consumer

00:06:57.264 --> 00:07:01.767
gets high-quality products with no delay.

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:11.273
A good selection of our cheeses is
waiting for consumers

00:07:11.273 --> 00:07:15.273
at Rimi in Ülemiste
and other grocery stores.
