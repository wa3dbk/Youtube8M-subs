it all in and we've got ourselves a
working<00:05:03.300> blush<00:05:03.960> hidden<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:04.860> seamless<00:05:06.050> piston

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
working blush hidden and seamless piston

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.760 
working blush hidden and seamless piston
stairs<00:05:08.539> at<00:05:09.539> the<00:05:09.720> beginning<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.320> video<00:05:10.560> I

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
stairs at the beginning of this video I

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.740 
stairs at the beginning of this video I
mentioned<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.430> needed<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.820> hard<00:05:12.180> set<00:05:12.479> power

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
mentioned you needed a hard set power

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.170 
mentioned you needed a hard set power
supply<00:05:13.200> all<00:05:13.530> this<00:05:13.919> means<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.610> if<00:05:15.000> you're

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
supply all this means is that if you're

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.710 
supply all this means is that if you're
powering<00:05:15.599> the<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:17.400> staircase<00:05:18.000> from<00:05:18.330> under

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
powering the the staircase from under

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.360 
powering the the staircase from under
the<00:05:18.840> ground<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.590> will<00:05:19.710> need<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:20.010> use<00:05:20.039> a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
the ground you will need to use a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.440 
the ground you will need to use a
redstone<00:05:21.030> repeater<00:05:22.849> so<00:05:23.849> that<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.120> would<00:05:24.240> look

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
redstone repeater so that it would look

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.719 
redstone repeater so that it would look
like<00:05:24.889> this<00:05:27.950> another<00:05:28.950> problem<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.520> might<00:05:29.669> be

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
like this another problem you might be

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.670 
like this another problem you might be
having<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.419> a<00:05:32.599> piston<00:05:33.599> here<00:05:33.750> this<00:05:34.169> piston

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
having is that a piston here this piston

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.529 
having is that a piston here this piston
might<00:05:34.889> be<00:05:35.039> powering<00:05:35.460> might<00:05:36.000> be<00:05:36.180> getting

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
might be powering might be getting

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.339 
might be powering might be getting
powered<00:05:36.900> before<00:05:37.260> this<00:05:37.470> repeat<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:38.190> piston

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
powered before this repeat this piston

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.170 
powered before this repeat this piston
simple<00:05:40.349> fix<00:05:40.620> is<00:05:40.919> just<00:05:40.950> to<00:05:41.310> place<00:05:41.550> an<00:05:41.760> immovable

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
simple fix is just to place an immovable

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.680 
simple fix is just to place an immovable
block<00:05:42.720> on<00:05:42.990> top<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:44.389> you<00:05:45.389> should<00:05:45.660> be

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
block on top of that and you should be

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:55.320 
block on top of that and you should be
good<00:05:46.110> to<00:05:46.289> go

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.389
