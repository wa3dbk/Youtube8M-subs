00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's not easy when when you have to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.940 
it's not easy when when you have to
leave<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.950> team<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.050> were<00:02:39.260> four<00:02:39.920> years

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
leave a team that you were four years

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.130 
leave a team that you were four years
ago

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
ago

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.790 
ago
and<00:02:42.140> they<00:02:42.830> develop<00:02:43.280> people<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
and they develop people and all the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.520 
and they develop people and all the
supporters<00:02:48.340> they<00:02:49.340> they<00:02:49.670> trade<00:02:50.239> me<00:02:50.530> really

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
supporters they they trade me really

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.009 
supporters they they trade me really
really<00:02:51.709> well<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.489> four<00:02:52.730> years<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.660> cannot

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
really well in four years so I cannot

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:02.110 
really well in four years so I cannot
say<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.920> difficult<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:59.690> live<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:01.120> thought

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
say it's difficult to live but I thought

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.240 
say it's difficult to live but I thought
that<00:03:02.500> my<00:03:03.500> time<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.330> developer<00:03:05.870> was<00:03:06.250> was

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
that my time in in developer was was

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.009 
that my time in in developer was was
over<00:03:08.209> was<00:03:08.510> finished<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.549> that<00:03:10.549> was<00:03:10.850> because<00:03:11.660> I

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
over was finished so that was because I

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.960
