 this pack of four poor 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.960
 because we decided to make a package of the 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.880
 poppers here where it's legal 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.860

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.270
 fishermen 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.250
 because the power does not get stuck is not it 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.130
 sinks always stays in the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.789
 surface and especially because it is a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.920
 decoy that the truth 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.010
 experience has given me many many 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.440
 catch 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.210

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 crystalline we have the classic head 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.510

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.520
 You can make very long sets with these 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.550
 buffers but what defines these poker 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.300
 it is this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 here in the part of the gills and in the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.490
