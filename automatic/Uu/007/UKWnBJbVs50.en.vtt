00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
not sure what's responsible for the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
not sure what's responsible for the

powder in this but if I had to guess I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.530 
and the Musk kind of combining along
with<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.060> Nutmeg<00:02:10.909> because<00:02:11.909> it's<00:02:12.390> very

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
with the Nutmeg because it's very

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.910 
with the Nutmeg because it's very
powdery<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:14.780> slightly<00:02:15.780> feminine<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.709> my
