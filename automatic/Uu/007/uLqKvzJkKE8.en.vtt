00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.709 

you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 

well<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> guess<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> could<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.219> personal

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
well I guess it could be personal

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
well I guess it could be personal
preference<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.359> me<00:00:51.480> I'd<00:00:51.870> rather<00:00:52.050> side

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
preference but for me I'd rather side

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
preference but for me I'd rather side
with<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:52.920> clip<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:53.910> pulling<00:00:54.180> off

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
with the first clip when pulling off

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
with the first clip when pulling off
longer<00:00:54.719> time-lapse<00:00:55.140> clips<00:00:55.440> I'd<00:00:55.710> always<00:00:55.890> like

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
longer time-lapse clips I'd always like

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.619 
longer time-lapse clips I'd always like
to<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.489> waving<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:56.969> disabled<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to have the waving that's disabled just

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.090 
to have the waving that's disabled just
so<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> doesn't<00:00:58.140> distract<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.860> actual

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so it doesn't distract from the actual

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
so it doesn't distract from the actual
scene<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.610> recording<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.839> that<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.050> know

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
scene and recording so now that you know

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.600 
scene and recording so now that you know
might<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.769> thing<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> disable<00:01:02.550> way

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
might be a good thing to disable way

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.249 
might be a good thing to disable way

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.050 

before<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.590> begin<00:01:10.950> let<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.460> tell<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
before we begin let me tell you that the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.969 
before we begin let me tell you that the
process<00:01:12.540> may<00:01:12.690> seem<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> wee<00:01:13.229> bit<00:01:13.380> longer<00:01:13.590> first

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
process may seem a wee bit longer first

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
process may seem a wee bit longer first
but<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:14.729> experience<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.720> could<00:01:15.869> rush

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but with some experience you could rush

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.800 
but with some experience you could rush
through<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> less<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.039> minute<00:01:17.810> first

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

on<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.520> these<00:01:56.729> shaders<00:01:57.239> so<00:01:57.629> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
on all these shaders so you can get a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.749 
on all these shaders so you can get a
pretty<00:01:58.289> good<00:01:58.379> idea<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.860> how<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.220> do<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.550> on

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
pretty good idea on how to do this on

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.270 
pretty good idea on how to do this on
nearly<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.179> shaders<00:02:00.660> packs<00:02:01.069> we'll<00:02:02.069> start

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
nearly all shaders packs we'll start

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
nearly all shaders packs we'll start
with<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:02.550> suits<00:02:02.789> first<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.869> right

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
with the suits first all right

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.109 
with the suits first all right
locate<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> text<00:02:04.920> file<00:02:05.069> called<00:02:05.429> G<00:02:05.700> buffers

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
locate the text file called G buffers

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630 
locate the text file called G buffers
underscore<00:02:06.629> terrain<00:02:07.080> for<00:02:07.950> editing<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> file

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
underscore terrain for editing the file

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
underscore terrain for editing the file
I'd<00:02:08.910> strongly<00:02:09.179> advise<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:10.020> download

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
I'd strongly advise you to go download

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.070 
I'd strongly advise you to go download
notepad<00:02:10.950> plus<00:02:11.280> plus<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:12.180> well<00:02:12.360> look<00:02:12.959> at

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
notepad plus plus because well look at

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.260 
notepad plus plus because well look at
the<00:02:13.170> footage<00:02:13.379> notepad<00:02:14.190> plus<00:02:14.430> plus<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:15.030> looks

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the footage notepad plus plus just looks

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.180 
the footage notepad plus plus just looks
far<00:02:15.720> less<00:02:15.989> confusing<00:02:16.470> compared<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
far less confusing compared to the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.729 
far less confusing compared to the
original<00:02:17.250> notepad<00:02:18.290> when<00:02:19.290> you've<00:02:19.410> open<00:02:19.680> the

original notepad when you've open the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.790 
original notepad when you've open the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
file I want you to locate these these

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.770 
file I want you to locate these these
texts<00:02:23.400> or<00:02:23.550> codes<00:02:23.849> or<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.599> call

texts or codes or if we want to call

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.930 
texts or codes or if we want to call
them<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.290> basically<00:02:26.069> your<00:02:26.519> on<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.849> off

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940

the waiving terrain code meaning away

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.860 
the waiving terrain code meaning away
from<00:02:35.190> terrain<00:02:35.519> but<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.330> specific<00:02:36.840> thing

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
from terrain but for that specific thing

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.750 
from terrain but for that specific thing
in<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.680> case<00:02:37.920> with

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
in this case with

in this case with
for<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:39.939> video<00:02:40.239> we're<00:02:40.599> disabling

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
for this video we're disabling

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.470 
for this video we're disabling
everything<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.129> mean<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.299> see

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
everything and I mean it as you can see

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000 
everything and I mean it as you can see
this<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.810> what<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.079> text<00:02:44.349> file<00:02:44.500> looks<00:02:44.799> like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
this is what the text file looks like

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.949 
this is what the text file looks like
when<00:02:45.310> all<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.790> way<00:02:45.909> the<00:02:46.060> terrain<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.450> disabled

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
when all the way the terrain is disabled

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.830 
when all the way the terrain is disabled
and<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.470> game<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:48.129> is<00:02:48.280> what<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.549> get<00:02:48.819> no<00:02:49.629> wavy

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and in game this is what you get no wavy

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.020 
and in game this is what you get no wavy
terrain

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.520 

if<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.180> want<00:02:57.450> wave<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.840> terrain<00:02:58.020> turn<00:02:58.290> back

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
if you want wave and terrain turn back

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
if you want wave and terrain turn back
on<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:59.250> move<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.700> slashes<00:03:00.150> as<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.540> see

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
on just move the slashes as you can see

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.780 
on just move the slashes as you can see
here<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.350> then<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.740> have<00:03:01.860> back<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.310> pretty

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
here and then you have back on pretty

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.430 
here and then you have back on pretty
simple

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.200
