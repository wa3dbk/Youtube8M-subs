00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.149
 Cars 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.660
 I am a plasta car cars 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.720
 and doing the practice 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.280
 very much would be a lot to the flow 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.850
 very much I do not have more for me 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.850
 I have this way 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.380
 he has it wrong he has everything to stand 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:34.349
 to the shit is reciprocated has not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.349
 caught has read 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.879
 unless it has not arrived 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.150
 then he was alive because he has 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.069
 rolled up then you got up and stepped on 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.629
 as more thrown against the edge that 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.489
 more thrown I could jump we have 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.920
 dropped all but when the ticket 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.170
 that gives a little pistol but we're going 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.170
 that would give him time to run over a monkey 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:17.250
 we do not have a suit that is streamlined 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.689
 trucks in the middle of the road 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.689
 touching the eggs here 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.420
 I'm a little worse 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.870

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:42.020

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:42.020

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.280
 this week week the soil 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.440
 You gave him suicide by putting the camera to 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.440
 post to be to see as street 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.590
 if we get is we win 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.570

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.570
 we get this we earn little vale 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.700

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:44.360
 that come full steam after careful 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.360
 this is thought 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:55.990
 counter counter we go good in exempted 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.990
 counter would then be quick what I notice 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.730
 with me 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.729
 perfect perfect both bring the 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.419

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.659

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.430
 the searched trucks 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.430
 if it takes a long time 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.150

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.840
 we are taking to give more to the 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.840
 description of fault 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:06.040
 let's see how it takes it I'm almost the 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.400
 goal if I'm lucky inside if it's not worth 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.400
 I am going 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:18.520
 the cyclist would throw him the torerito that 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:26.230
