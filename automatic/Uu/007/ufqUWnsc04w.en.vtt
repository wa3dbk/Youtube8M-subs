00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
greater speed and greater accuracy in a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.580 
greater speed and greater accuracy in a
shorter<00:00:15.599> period<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> time<00:00:16.020> than<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.410> might

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
shorter period of time than you might

in<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> main<00:00:22.470> elements<00:00:23.039> needed<00:00:23.220> in

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
in on two of the main elements needed in

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
in on two of the main elements needed in
creating<00:00:23.939> greater<00:00:24.150> speed<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
creating greater speed and that is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
creating greater speed and that is
forced<00:00:26.039> accuracy<00:00:26.699> as<00:00:26.880> well<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.359> economy<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
forced accuracy as well as economy of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
forced accuracy as well as economy of
motion<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:29.039> great<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.490> multiple

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
motion it's great with multiple

techniques as well whether it be

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.500 
techniques as well whether it be
alternate<00:00:32.130> picking<00:00:32.369> directional<00:00:33.090> picking

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
of standard pick it's simply impossible

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.709 
of standard pick it's simply impossible
to<00:00:46.020> play<00:00:46.320> incorrectly<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.670> pick<00:00:47.940> so

that way when you go to pick up your

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
that way when you go to pick up your

that<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> normally<00:00:52.590> use<00:00:52.860> makes<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> much

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that you normally use makes it much
