00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
curve for stain and glaze was a little

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.290 
curve for stain and glaze was a little
bit<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> beginning<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:50.910> bit<00:01:51.119> tough

bit in the beginning a little bit tough

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.090 
bit in the beginning a little bit tough
because<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.780> knew<00:01:51.930> how<00:01:52.110> great<00:01:52.440> our<00:01:52.619> lab<00:01:52.830> was

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
because we knew how great our lab was

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
because we knew how great our lab was
but<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.940> my<00:01:54.150> girls<00:01:54.479> got<00:01:54.720> training<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.320> mean<00:01:55.590> when

we're<00:01:55.890> working<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> bests<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
we're working with one of the bests you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
we're working with one of the bests you
know<00:01:57.720> or<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.050> least<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.410> best<00:01:58.650> lab<00:01:59.070> scientist

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
know or at least the best lab scientist

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.070 
know or at least the best lab scientist
in<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> world<00:01:59.820> Lee<00:02:00.240> Culp<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.720> he's<00:02:00.840> teaching

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
in the world Lee Culp and he's teaching

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.240 
in the world Lee Culp and he's teaching
us<00:02:01.350> his<00:02:01.619> secrets

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
us his secrets

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
us his secrets
in<00:02:02.369> training<00:02:03.060> courses<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.810> allowing<00:02:04.470> us<00:02:04.619> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
in training courses it's allowing us to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.400 
in training courses it's allowing us to
really<00:02:05.340> produce<00:02:05.640> beautiful<00:02:06.410> restorations

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
really produce beautiful restorations

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.410 
really produce beautiful restorations
it's<00:02:08.040> just<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.429> everything<00:02:08.940> else<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.390> have

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
it's just like everything else you have

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
it's just like everything else you have
to<00:02:09.840> spend<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:10.350> time<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> have

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to spend a little time you have to have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.300 
to spend a little time you have to have
the<00:02:13.310> motivation<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.380> it's<00:02:16.380> challenging<00:02:16.650> but

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the motivation and it's challenging but

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.280 
the motivation and it's challenging but
it's<00:02:17.550> when<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.140> again

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it's when you do it and you do it again

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.270 
it's when you do it and you do it again
and<00:02:19.739> again<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.430> becomes<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.209> routine<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:23.040> has

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and again it becomes just routine it has

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.310 
and again it becomes just routine it has
been<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.610> positive<00:02:24.060> ROI<00:02:24.239> since<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.110> first

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
been a positive ROI since the first

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.789 
been a positive ROI since the first
month

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
month

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.390 
month
it's<00:02:26.459> basically<00:02:27.030> cut<00:02:27.390> my<00:02:27.540> lab<00:02:27.750> bill<00:02:28.019> in<00:02:28.140> half

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it's basically cut my lab bill in half

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.330 
it's basically cut my lab bill in half
so<00:02:29.570> honestly<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.440> first<00:02:31.890> piece<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so honestly it's the first piece of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.620 
so honestly it's the first piece of
dental<00:02:32.489> equipment<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.269> my<00:02:33.420> office

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
dental equipment that's in my office

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.199 
dental equipment that's in my office
that's<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:34.410> paid<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:34.709> itself<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.580> is

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
that's actually paid for itself and is

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.020 
that's actually paid for itself and is
making<00:02:36.390> me<00:02:36.660> money<00:02:37.280> not<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> mention<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.850> it's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
making me money not to mention that it's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.789 
making me money not to mention that it's
bringing<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.360> new<00:02:39.510> patients<00:02:40.019> not<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.620> mention

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
bringing in new patients not to mention

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.000 
bringing in new patients not to mention
it's<00:02:41.100> increasing<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.030> staff<00:02:42.299> morale<00:02:42.590> all<00:02:43.590> good

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
it's increasing my staff morale all good

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.789 
it's increasing my staff morale all good
things<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.519> have<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.420> partner<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.200> both<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> us

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
things I have a partner and both of us

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.860 
things I have a partner and both of us
using<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
using the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.009 
using the
the<00:02:48.170> first<00:02:48.470> month<00:02:48.739> we<00:02:49.060> probably<00:02:50.060> did<00:02:50.269> about<00:02:50.299> 30

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
the first month we probably did about 30

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.970 
the first month we probably did about 30
units<00:02:51.860> on<00:02:52.189> the<00:02:52.430> machine<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.769> we've<00:02:54.769> been

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
units on the machine and we've been

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.030 
units on the machine and we've been
doing<00:02:55.340> about<00:02:55.640> 30<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.450> 40<00:02:56.870> units<00:02:57.260> every<00:02:57.799> month

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
doing about 30 to 40 units every month

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.550 
doing about 30 to 40 units every month
so<00:02:58.790> we<00:02:58.909> paid<00:02:59.180> fire<00:02:59.450> machine<00:02:59.870> within<00:03:00.230> six

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so we paid fire machine within six

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.420 
so we paid fire machine within six
months<00:03:01.750> well<00:03:02.750> basically<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.709> are<00:03:03.739> using<00:03:03.829> IVA

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
months well basically we are using IVA

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.550 
months well basically we are using IVA
