00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
quite a lot and Denair accountable an

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.990 
quite a lot and Denair accountable an
unusual<00:00:04.259> situation<00:00:04.850> or<00:00:05.850> not<00:00:06.029> unusual<00:00:06.420> but<00:00:06.600> I

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
unusual situation or not unusual but I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.839 
unusual situation or not unusual but I
basically<00:00:09.000> forgot<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.019> door<00:00:10.230> anchor<00:00:10.849> look

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
basically forgot the door anchor look

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.720 
basically forgot the door anchor look
client<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:13.110> instead<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:14.219> using<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
client so instead of just not using it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.010 
client so instead of just not using it
or<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:15.420> back<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.839> it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
or going back to get it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.710 
or going back to get it
or<00:00:16.340> an<00:00:17.340> hour<00:00:17.430> support<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.910> try<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.240> rig<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
or an hour support I try and rig up a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
or an hour support I try and rig up a
system<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.619> would<00:00:19.680> work<00:00:19.920> without<00:00:20.609> using

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
system that would work without using

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.220 
system that would work without using
adoring<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> no<00:00:23.730> chance<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.990> quite

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
adoring so no chance of you it's quite

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.519 
adoring so no chance of you it's quite
useful<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> basically<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.080> use<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
useful so basically you can use this of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.560 
useful so basically you can use this of
it<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> worked<00:00:29.220> quite<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:29.400> without<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> door

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it it worked quite well without the door

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.209 
it it worked quite well without the door
anchor<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> basically<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.710> involves

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
anchor and it basically just involves

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.430 
anchor and it basically just involves
just<00:00:32.430> making<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> knot<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> top<00:00:33.230> as<00:00:34.230> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
just making a knot on the top as you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.220 
just making a knot on the top as you
might<00:00:34.559> guess<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.230> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
might guess all right so what we do is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.590 
might guess all right so what we do is
I'm<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.590> put<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.950> crew<00:00:38.390> one<00:00:39.390> above

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
doesn't really matter how you have you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.990 
doesn't really matter how you have you
do<00:01:58.480> this<00:01:58.690> if<00:01:59.110> I'm<00:01:59.290> honest<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.800> mean<00:02:00.000> simpler

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
do this if I'm honest I mean simpler

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.370 
do this if I'm honest I mean simpler
it's<00:02:01.150> better<00:02:01.330> if<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.690> don't<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.050> untie

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
it's better if you don't have to untie

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.160 
it's better if you don't have to untie
it<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.560> million<00:02:03.070> times<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.430> week<00:02:03.580> good<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:04.390> you

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
it a million times a week good and you

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.600 
it a million times a week good and you
just<00:02:05.200> really<00:02:05.620> need<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.800> get<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.070> metal<00:02:06.400> clip

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
just really need to get that metal clip

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.980 
just really need to get that metal clip
so<00:02:07.540> it's<00:02:07.660> nowhere<00:02:07.810> near<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.170> door<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:09.990> light

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
so it's nowhere near the door or light

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.800 
so it's nowhere near the door or light
on<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.230> really<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:13.030> know<00:02:13.180> any<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.720> can

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
on that really you know any of you can

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.800 
on that really you know any of you can
think<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.140> better<00:02:14.260> way<00:02:14.470> let<00:02:14.650> me<00:02:14.680> know<00:02:14.770> but<00:02:15.040> uh

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
think of a better way let me know but uh

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.050 
think of a better way let me know but uh
that's<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:16.960> came<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.820> seemed

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
that's what I came up with and it seemed

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.960 
that's what I came up with and it seemed
what<00:02:19.240> seemed<00:02:19.930> Ecuador<00:02:20.290> Inca<00:02:20.970> essentially
