00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
codes and the solutions to it you would

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.380 
codes and the solutions to it you would
do<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> steps<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> would

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
do all the steps on there and you would

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
do all the steps on there and you would
also<00:00:33.630> they<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.590> tell<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> certain<00:00:35.160> stuff

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
also they don't tell you certain stuff

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.660

so oh gosh you guys do that what you
would<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.070> manually<00:00:44.149> assign<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> IP

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
would do is manually assign that IP

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
would do is manually assign that IP
