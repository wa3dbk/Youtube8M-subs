00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
Hey so this is going to show you how to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.570 
Hey so this is going to show you how to
measure<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> woven<00:00:06.089> wrap<00:00:06.589> to<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.429> need

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
measure a woven wrap to do this you need

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.770 
measure a woven wrap to do this you need
a<00:00:08.639> woven<00:00:09.120> wrap<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.769> you<00:00:10.769> need<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.780> soft

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
a woven wrap and you need a soft

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.980 
a woven wrap and you need a soft
measuring<00:00:13.530> tape<00:00:14.030> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:15.750> from

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
measuring tape this is different from

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.330 
measuring tape this is different from
like<00:00:16.699> the<00:00:18.529> hard<00:00:19.529> measuring<00:00:19.920> tape<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.250> you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
like the hard measuring tape that you

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.429 
like the hard measuring tape that you
might<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.760> measure<00:00:21.740> furniture<00:00:22.740> or<00:00:24.439> things

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
might use to measure furniture or things

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.939 
might use to measure furniture or things
like<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.769> soft<00:00:26.519> tape<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.560> what<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.680> need<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
like that soft tape is what you need to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.569 
like that soft tape is what you need to
use<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.519> measure<00:00:29.640> wraps<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:32.279> measure

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
use to measure wraps and you measure

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.520 
use to measure wraps and you measure
soft<00:00:33.059> tape<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.510> hand<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:33.960> means<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
soft tape and hand which means that

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.920 
soft tape and hand which means that
rather<00:00:35.219> than<00:00:35.399> weighing<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.180> wrap<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
rather than weighing the wrap out on the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.319 
rather than weighing the wrap out on the
floor<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:38.010> measuring<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> way<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.000> hold

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
floor and measuring it that way you hold

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.049 
floor and measuring it that way you hold
it<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.690> hand<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> run<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.800> tape

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
it in your hand and you run the tape

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.040 
it in your hand and you run the tape
along<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.690> rail<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> measurement<00:00:45.270> so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
along the rail to get the measurement so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.010 
along the rail to get the measurement so
you<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> measure<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.129> centimeters

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
you want to measure in centimeters

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.970 
you want to measure in centimeters
that's<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> centimeter<00:00:49.500> side<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:49.950> there

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that's the centimeter side right there

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
that's the centimeter side right there
you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.940> measure<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.390> inches<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
you can measure in inches if you want to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.750 
you can measure in inches if you want to
but<00:00:55.100> centimeters<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> better<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.579> then

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but centimeters is better because then

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.290 
but centimeters is better because then
you<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> convert<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.300> put

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you don't have to convert it so you put

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.340 
you don't have to convert it so you put
your<00:01:00.420> tape<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.129> edge<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.969> rail

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
your tape on the very edge of one rail

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.750 
your tape on the very edge of one rail
it<00:01:04.350> doesn't<00:01:04.680> matter<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.519> should

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it doesn't matter which one they should

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.170 
it doesn't matter which one they should
be<00:01:06.030> even<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.909> run<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
be even and you kind of just run the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.039 
be even and you kind of just run the
tape<00:01:09.920> along<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.250> rail<00:01:16.340> okay<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.270> I've<00:01:18.509> hit<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
tape along the rail okay so I've hit the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.850 
tape along the rail okay so I've hit the
end<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.670> measurement<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.080> 150

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
end of the measurement here which is 150

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.030 
end of the measurement here which is 150
centimeters<00:01:23.689> I'm<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.229> hold<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
centimeters I'm just going to hold the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.149 
centimeters I'm just going to hold the
place<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.330> finger<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.020> start<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> tape

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
place with my finger and start the tape

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.420 
place with my finger and start the tape
from<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.610> again<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> we're<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.590> 150<00:01:32.220> right

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
from there again so we're at 150 right

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.830 
from there again so we're at 150 right
now<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:36.479> running

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
now and we're just going to keep running

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
now and we're just going to keep running
it<00:01:37.640> along<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.119> rail

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.350 

okay<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.600> we've<00:01:54.870> hit<00:01:55.050> 150<00:01:55.500> again<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.950> here

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
okay so we've hit 150 again right here

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
okay so we've hit 150 again right here
so<00:01:57.360> I'm<00:01:57.570> holding<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.409> place<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.979> an

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
so I'm holding this place and we have an

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.390 
so I'm holding this place and we have an
extra<00:02:08.459> 35<00:02:09.170> inches<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.830> 150<00:02:11.640> 150<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.630> 35<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.560> 335

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
extra 35 inches so 150 150 and 35 is 335

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.900 
extra 35 inches so 150 150 and 35 is 335
and<00:02:15.380> there<00:02:16.380> are<00:02:16.560> 100<00:02:17.070> centimeters<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.880> meter

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and there are 100 centimeters in a meter

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.840 
and there are 100 centimeters in a meter
so<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.570> means<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.890> rap<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.489> three

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
so that means that this rap is three

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
so that means that this rap is three
point<00:02:21.209> three<00:02:21.570> five<00:02:21.810> meters<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:24.480> should

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
point three five meters it should

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.870 
point three five meters it should
measure<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.350> same<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.070> measured<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.700> on

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
measure the same if you measured it on

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.250 
measure the same if you measured it on
the<00:02:27.000> other<00:02:27.120> side<00:02:27.410> with<00:02:28.410> raps<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.959> have

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the other side with raps that have

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.070 
the other side with raps that have
tapers<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.610> taper<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.090> parallelogram<00:02:33.600> so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
tapers the taper is a parallelogram so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470 
tapers the taper is a parallelogram so
even<00:02:34.350> though<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.620> side<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.040> longer<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:36.300> got

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
even though this side is longer you got

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.729 
even though this side is longer you got
the<00:02:36.570> short<00:02:36.750> side<00:02:37.080> here<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:42.920> long<00:02:43.920> side<00:02:45.739> up

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the short side here and the long side up

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.759 
the short side here and the long side up
here<00:02:47.100> somewhere<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:49.200> you're<00:02:49.410> measuring

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
here somewhere so if you're measuring

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.350 
here somewhere so if you're measuring
your<00:02:49.950> rap<00:02:50.160> with<00:02:50.519> hard<00:02:50.790> tape<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.239> you're

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
your rap with hard tape and you're

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.930 
your rap with hard tape and you're
finding<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.220> measuring<00:02:53.220> short<00:02:53.489> don't

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
finding that it's measuring short don't

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.290 
finding that it's measuring short don't
worry

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
worry

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.069 
worry
measure<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.110> with<00:02:55.260> soft<00:02:55.500> tape<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.920> see<00:02:56.810> how<00:02:57.810> it

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
measure it with soft tape and see how it
