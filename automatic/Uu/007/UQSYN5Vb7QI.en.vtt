came now when I say impress I don't mean

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
came now when I say impress I don't mean
mind-blowing<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.000> anything<00:01:03.239> they're<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
mind-blowing or anything they're just

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
mind-blowing or anything they're just
simple<00:01:04.140> cases<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.100> well<00:01:05.250> designed<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
simple cases that are well designed and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
simple cases that are well designed and
work<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.180> intended

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
work as intended

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
work as intended
I<00:01:06.869> say<00:01:07.380> well-designed<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.369> don't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
I say well-designed because they don't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.859 
I say well-designed because they don't
interfere<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> experience<00:01:09.689> like

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
interfere with the experience like

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.690 
interfere with the experience like
navigating<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> OS<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.310> covering

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
navigating through the OS or covering

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
navigating through the OS or covering
the<00:01:11.820> microphone<00:01:11.990> everything<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.080> open<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the microphone everything is open and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
the microphone everything is open and
thankfully<00:01:14.070> non<00:01:14.490> intrusive<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
thankfully non intrusive and that's the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
thankfully non intrusive and that's the
most<00:01:16.110> important<00:01:16.590> part<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> any<00:01:17.130> accessory<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
most important part of any accessory and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
most important part of any accessory and
what<00:01:18.450> comes<00:01:18.630> second<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> non<00:01:19.350> intrusiveness

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
what comes second to non intrusiveness

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.160 
what comes second to non intrusiveness
is<00:01:20.220> design<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> appearance<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.080> my

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
is design and appearance and in my

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
is design and appearance and in my
opinion<00:01:22.259> snug<00:01:22.830> cases<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.280> best<00:01:23.549> complemented

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
opinion snug cases are best complemented

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
opinion snug cases are best complemented

these silicone wraps all the way around

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
these silicone wraps all the way around
the<00:01:39.360> housing<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> gives<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.170> half<00:01:40.380> millimeter

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the housing and gives a half millimeter

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
the housing and gives a half millimeter

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
or so of lip from the display in order

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
or so of lip from the display in order
to<00:01:42.960> protect<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:44.070> come<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.399> sorts

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
to protect it and they come in all sorts

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.190 
to protect it and they come in all sorts
of<00:01:44.729> colors<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.390> mix<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.899> match<00:01:45.960> your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
of colors so you can mix and match your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
of colors so you can mix and match your
own<00:01:46.290> combination<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> everything<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> see

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
own combination and everything you see

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.889 
own combination and everything you see
here<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.270> replaceable

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
here is replaceable

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
here is replaceable
especially<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> straps<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.060> buy<00:01:51.210> more

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
especially the straps so if you buy more

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
especially the straps so if you buy more
than<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.780> color<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.500> say<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:53.250> put<00:01:53.430> red

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
than one color let's say you can put red

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
than one color let's say you can put red
on<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:54.090> side<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.570> green<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> other<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
on one side and green on the other and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.160 
on one side and green on the other and
luckily<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.460> pretty<00:01:56.820> easy<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.420> speaking

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
luckily it's pretty easy to do speaking

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.630 
luckily it's pretty easy to do speaking
of<00:01:58.259> straps<00:01:58.560> though<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.070> I'll<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.280> put<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.460> lot

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.280 
of straps though so I'll just put a lot
of<00:01:59.729> time<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> effort<00:02:00.570> into<00:02:00.689> designing<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
perspective protection wise which is the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.309 
perspective protection wise which is the
reason<00:02:38.879> why<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> would<00:02:39.150> buy<00:02:39.299> this<00:02:39.540> case<00:02:39.750> it's

reason why you would buy this case it's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.410 
reason why you would buy this case it's
going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.830> job<00:02:41.010> done<00:02:41.310> as<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:42.060> said<00:02:42.239> they

protected and because the silicone is
thick<00:02:48.540> enough<00:02:48.569> impact<00:02:49.349> protection<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.920> going

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
thick enough impact protection is going

thick enough impact protection is going
to<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.250> definitely<00:02:50.430> there<00:02:50.959> obviously

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
to be definitely there obviously

to be definitely there obviously
scratches<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.620> scrubs<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.099> be<00:02:53.190> easily
