around prize interesting one for me
because<00:02:09.119> he's<00:02:09.479> kind<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
because he's kind of

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.720 
because he's kind of
damned<00:02:11.439> either<00:02:11.709> way<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> sense<00:02:12.640> that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
damned either way in the sense that

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.009 
damned either way in the sense that
we've<00:02:13.030> been<00:02:13.120> talking<00:02:13.329> about<00:02:13.510> him<00:02:13.810> getting

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
we've been talking about him getting

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.959 
we've been talking about him getting
stuck<00:02:14.290> against<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.680> short<00:02:14.950> ball<00:02:15.129> and<00:02:15.579> if<00:02:15.849> that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
stuck against the short ball and if that

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.009 
stuck against the short ball and if that
people<00:02:16.269> this<00:02:16.329> morning<00:02:16.629> was<00:02:16.719> saying<00:02:16.930> he's

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
people this morning was saying he's

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.539 
people this morning was saying he's
better<00:02:17.200> off<00:02:17.260> taking<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.829> on<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.189> takes<00:02:18.370> it

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
better off taking it on so it takes it

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.250 
better off taking it on so it takes it
on<00:02:18.640> smacks<00:02:18.939> it<00:02:19.120> hard<00:02:19.299> gets<00:02:19.930> caught<00:02:20.109> on<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
on smacks it hard gets caught on the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.470 
on smacks it hard gets caught on the
boundary<00:02:20.620> yeah<00:02:21.219> but<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.640> think<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.090> difference

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
boundary yeah but I think the difference

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.929 
boundary yeah but I think the difference
there<00:02:22.719> is<00:02:22.750> when<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.709> saw<00:02:24.069> Pryor<00:02:24.370> taking<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:24.909> I

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
there is when I saw Pryor taking on I

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.280 
there is when I saw Pryor taking on I
thought<00:02:25.180> that's<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> right<00:02:25.719> way<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.109> him<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
thought that's the right way for him to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.899 
thought that's the right way for him to
go<00:02:26.409> they've<00:02:26.560> got<00:02:26.680> three<00:02:26.950> men<00:02:27.159> out<00:02:27.310> there<00:02:27.519> all

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
go they've got three men out there all

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.309 
go they've got three men out there all
you<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.329> just<00:02:28.359> knock<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.780> down<00:02:28.959> there

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
you do is you just knock it down there

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.780 
you do is you just knock it down there
for<00:02:29.349> one<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.829> get<00:02:29.980> off<00:02:30.099> strike<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.670> that's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
for one and get off strike and that's

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.949 
for one and get off strike and that's
what<00:02:30.909> you<00:02:31.000> never<00:02:31.209> do<00:02:31.389> for<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.629> while<00:02:31.750> they're

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
what you never do for a while they're

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.410 
what you never do for a while they're
going<00:02:32.139> single<00:02:32.769> single<00:02:33.159> single<00:02:33.519> single<00:02:33.939> but

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
going single single single single but

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.089 
going single single single single but
then<00:02:34.569> India<00:02:34.870> came<00:02:35.049> round<00:02:35.379> that<00:02:35.680> wicket<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
then India came round that wicket to

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.580 
then India came round that wicket to
Matt<00:02:36.280> prior<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:37.209> created<00:02:37.959> more<00:02:38.109> angle<00:02:38.439> and<00:02:38.530> he

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
Matt prior and created more angle and he

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.050 
Matt prior and created more angle and he
went<00:02:38.799> for<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:38.980> big<00:02:39.250> shot<00:02:39.549> rather<00:02:39.760> than<00:02:39.909> just

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
went for the big shot rather than just

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.819 
went for the big shot rather than just
knocking<00:02:40.389> on<00:02:40.510> his<00:02:40.599> head<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.019> is<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.799> a

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
knocking on his head so is it it was a

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.250 
knocking on his head so is it it was a
fault<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.939> Matt<00:02:43.150> Price<00:02:43.359> thinking<00:02:44.019> there<00:02:44.230> I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
fault in Matt Price thinking there I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.379 
fault in Matt Price thinking there I
think<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.889> I<00:02:45.010> opened<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.609> door<00:02:45.819> for<00:02:46.060> India

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
think and I opened the door for India

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.240 
think and I opened the door for India
and<00:02:46.569> once<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> door<00:02:47.139> was<00:02:47.169> open<00:02:47.620> they<00:02:47.829> pushed

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and once the door was open they pushed

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.800 
and once the door was open they pushed
their<00:02:48.519> way<00:02:48.549> through<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.599> was<00:02:49.689> an

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
their way through it it was an

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.149 
their way through it it was an
outstanding<00:02:50.079> period<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.680> play<00:02:50.799> from<00:02:51.010> their

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
outstanding period of play from their

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.140 
outstanding period of play from their
point<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.459> view<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:51.730> England<00:02:52.000> would<00:02:52.090> be

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
point of view but England would be

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.240 
point of view but England would be
bitterly<00:02:52.629> disappointed<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:53.319> such<00:02:53.950> an<00:02:54.099> obvious

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
bitterly disappointed is such an obvious

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.309 
bitterly disappointed is such an obvious
plan<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:55.359> know<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.719> and<00:02:56.169> so<00:02:56.469> so<00:02:57.719> poor<00:02:58.719> to<00:02:59.049> fall

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
plan you know and and so so poor to fall

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.280 
plan you know and and so so poor to fall
into<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.769> trap<00:03:00.239> tell<00:03:01.239> me<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.480> game<00:03:01.689> yeah<00:03:02.139> I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
into that trap tell me the game yeah I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.409 
into that trap tell me the game yeah I
have<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.400> take<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.730> point<00:03:03.969> and<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:04.239> one<00:03:04.359> of

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
have to take the point and it's one of

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.420 
have to take the point and it's one of
those<00:03:04.540> things<00:03:04.780> when<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.769> all<00:03:05.889> goes<00:03:06.069> horribly

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
those things when it all goes horribly

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.789 
those things when it all goes horribly
wrong<00:03:06.639> so<00:03:07.150> quickly<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:07.719> it<00:03:07.870> was<00:03:08.260> almost<00:03:08.439> as<00:03:08.769> if

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
wrong so quickly and it was almost as if

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.740 
wrong so quickly and it was almost as if
every<00:03:09.280> shot<00:03:09.519> we're<00:03:10.030> all<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> wicket<00:03:10.480> every

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
every shot we're all the wicket every

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.569 
every shot we're all the wicket every
year<00:03:10.930> there<00:03:11.260> wasn't<00:03:11.500> there<00:03:11.919> was<00:03:12.010> there<00:03:12.280> hardly

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
year there wasn't there was there hardly

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.399 
year there wasn't there was there hardly
any<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.939> between<00:03:13.269> going<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:13.780> four<00:03:13.930> at<00:03:14.260> that

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
any in between going for four at that

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.259 
any in between going for four at that
stage<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.459> was<00:03:15.549> relentless<00:03:16.000> from<00:03:16.150> that

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
stage so it was relentless from that

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.229 
stage so it was relentless from that
point<00:03:16.479> of<00:03:16.659> view<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.500> irony<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.549> all<00:03:18.609> David

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
it's not rocket science and the England

the mirror and I think there's got to be
some<00:04:16.780> changes<00:04:17.139> well<00:04:18.010> ok<00:04:19.079> leads<00:04:20.079> me<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.470> an

themselves<00:04:53.710> in<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.860> bit<00:04:53.979> of<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.130> quandary<00:04:54.460> at<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
themselves in a bit of a quandary at the

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.580 
themselves in a bit of a quandary at the
moment<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.000> still<00:04:55.330> don't<00:04:55.510> think<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.810> ECB<00:04:56.260> will

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
moment I still don't think the ECB will

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.230 
moment I still don't think the ECB will
want<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.889> sack<00:04:57.250> him<00:04:57.280> right<00:04:57.669> at<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.880> moment<00:04:58.000> I

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
want to sack him right at the moment I

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.790 
want to sack him right at the moment I
think<00:04:58.300> they'll<00:04:58.600> still<00:04:58.840> look<00:04:58.990> at<00:04:59.139> what's<00:04:59.620> the

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
think they'll still look at what's the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.950 
think they'll still look at what's the
best-case<00:05:00.160> scenario<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:01.840> he

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
best-case scenario and that is that he

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.050 
best-case scenario and that is that he
gets<00:05:02.110> runs<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:03.010> England<00:05:03.370> win<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> series<00:05:03.940> but

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
gets runs and England win the series but

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.900 
gets runs and England win the series but
from<00:05:04.240> his<00:05:04.360> own<00:05:04.570> point
