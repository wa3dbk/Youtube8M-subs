 game that I bring to the channel a new 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.670
 game that has been announced by part of 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.190
 colossal order and the paradox of 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.780
 interactive a new game that is going to 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.779
 develop with the creator address it 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.820
 of cis motion 1 and cites motion 2 and not 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.439
 is going to be the new game a test motion 3 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.730
 however good to be happy 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.650
 because there has not disappeared this 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.779
 developer the next game is going to 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.119
 follow the same role of same 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.579
 style of cities and games 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.750
 strategy but in this in this game it 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.670
 will focus more on the subject of 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.769
 develop the cities as you see in 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.410
 this game that is going to be called the cities 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.600
 'Skyscraper' is skyscraper cities 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.510
 you will be able to create your cities more 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.039
 in a style says xl or without city not with 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.129
 which the two rivals with whom 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.390
 you play are tough opponents I have a 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.460
 book about sharing or knowing how to discern 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.749
 which of the two is better but not good 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.949
 let's see how it is here as 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.449
 you can see the first images 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.579
 obviously the game is still being 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.980
 developing and the date is not yet known 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.960
 exact of its launch but good this 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.490
 is the game of the cetis skyline 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.260

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.810
 twitter on facebook and on the page 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100
 of paradox interactive with which good 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.570
 good news to follow 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.210
 developing these developers not 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.340
 it will appear it will not appear any 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.320
 another cis moulson but well let's see 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.300
 how is this game here you have eight 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.340

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.850

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.730
 features that report not as 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.860

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.020
 offline mode you already know that the sim 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.580
 city the new game had to be 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.560
 online and there were server failures 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.780
 with which this as new 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.310
