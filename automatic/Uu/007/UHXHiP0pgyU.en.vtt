masterpiece I Robot asked the question
how<00:01:53.490> well<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.180> prevent<00:01:54.600> them<00:01:54.750> from<00:01:54.780> taking

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
how well we prevent them from taking

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.100 
how well we prevent them from taking
over<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> question<00:01:56.910> for<00:01:56.940> 2010<00:01:57.690> becomes

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
over so the question for 2010 becomes

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.440 
over so the question for 2010 becomes
where<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.340> robots<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.390> were

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
where are all the robots they were

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
where are all the robots they were
predicted<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.380> years<00:02:01.710> ago<00:02:01.800> well<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
predicted to be here years ago well the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
predicted to be here years ago well the
good<00:02:03.030> news<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.540> working<00:02:04.290> robots<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.830> yes
