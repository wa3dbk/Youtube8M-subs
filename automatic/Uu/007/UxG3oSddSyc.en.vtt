nose notches first the very top of the
bridge<00:00:20.630> I'll<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:23.029> shallow<00:00:24.029> notch

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
bridge I'll make just a shallow notch

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.920 
bridge I'll make just a shallow notch
right<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:27.000> that'll<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.449> basically

okay<00:00:51.739> there<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.149> step<00:00:54.149> on

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.590 

okay<00:01:15.040> next<00:01:15.700> thing<00:01:15.820> I'd<00:01:15.939> like<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.119> do<00:01:16.360> is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
okay next thing I'd like to do is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.389 
okay next thing I'd like to do is
combine<00:01:17.590> steps<00:01:18.220> two<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.880> three<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:21.159> you<00:01:21.250> look

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
combine steps two and three if you look

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.850 
combine steps two and three if you look
at<00:01:21.490> anybody's<00:01:21.939> face<00:01:22.299> if<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.320> look<00:01:23.439> at<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.590> side

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
at anybody's face if you look at a side

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.850 
at anybody's face if you look at a side
profile<00:01:25.020> you'll<00:01:26.020> notice<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.439> their<00:01:26.649> nose

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
profile you'll notice that their nose

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.760 
profile you'll notice that their nose
sticks<00:01:27.850> out<00:01:28.060> further<00:01:28.630> than<00:01:29.020> anything<00:01:29.320> else<00:01:29.590> on

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
sticks out further than anything else on

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.060 
sticks out further than anything else on
the<00:01:29.799> face<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.330> eyes<00:01:31.479> are<00:01:32.070> further

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the face and that the eyes are further

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.649 
the face and that the eyes are further
back<00:01:33.310> into<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.670> head<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.210> if<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.360> get<00:01:34.479> those

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
back into the head so if you get those

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.620 
back into the head so if you get those
two<00:01:34.840> things<00:01:34.950> card<00:01:35.950> first<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:36.700> found<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.390> as<00:01:37.600> a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
two things card first I found that as a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.800 
two things card first I found that as a
little<00:01:37.990> off<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:39.070> best<00:01:39.310> trick<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.450> carving<00:01:40.780> a

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
little off the best trick to carving a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.620 
little off the best trick to carving a
successful<00:01:41.439> face<00:01:41.679> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:43.119> if<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.360> get<00:01:43.509> your

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
successful face and then if you get your

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.999 
successful face and then if you get your
eyes<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.170> your<00:01:44.259> nose<00:01:44.289> done

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
eyes and your nose done

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.260 
eyes and your nose done
and<00:01:45.100> then<00:01:45.310> just<00:01:45.460> base<00:01:45.640> everything<00:01:45.970> else

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
and then just base everything else

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.300 
and then just base everything else
around<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.899> you'll<00:01:47.679> be<00:01:47.830> well<00:01:48.009> on<00:01:48.039> your<00:01:48.250> way

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
around that you'll be well on your way

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.779 
around that you'll be well on your way
what<00:01:49.209> I've<00:01:49.299> done<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:50.220> sketched<00:01:51.220> out<00:01:51.459> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
what I've done here is sketched out the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.669 
what I've done here is sketched out the
outline<00:01:52.209> of<00:01:52.240> my<00:01:52.360> nose<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> pen<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.409> use<00:01:53.649> a

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
outline of my nose with a pen and use a

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.980 
outline of my nose with a pen and use a
pencil<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.909> I've<00:01:55.090> got<00:01:55.270> my<00:01:55.450> eye<00:01:55.479> lines

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
pencil and I've got my eye lines

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.820 
pencil and I've got my eye lines
straight<00:01:56.950> across<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:59.560> what<00:01:59.709> I<00:01:59.740> did

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
straight across so that's what I did

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.940 
straight across so that's what I did
with<00:02:00.009> step<00:02:00.280> two<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:01.360> step<00:02:01.420> three<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:02.770> just

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
with step two and step three I'm just

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
with step two and step three I'm just
going<00:02:03.099> to<00:02:03.130> make<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.789> stop<00:02:04.569> cut<00:02:04.959> stop<00:02:05.439> cut

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
going to make a stop cut stop cut

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.839 
going to make a stop cut stop cut
straight<00:02:06.970> now<00:02:07.209> not<00:02:07.539> too<00:02:07.780> deep<00:02:08.019> you<00:02:08.229> do<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.560> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
straight now not too deep you do it and

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.500 
straight now not too deep you do it and
do<00:02:09.849> it<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.030> layers<00:02:10.620> curved<00:02:11.620> around<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.239> get

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
do it in layers curved around then I get

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.789 
do it in layers curved around then I get
my<00:02:13.660> outline<00:02:14.489> stop<00:02:15.489> cut<00:02:15.790> there<00:02:16.140> okay<00:02:17.140> at<00:02:17.500> about

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
my outline stop cut there okay at about

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.289 
my outline stop cut there okay at about
a<00:02:17.829> 45<00:02:18.280> degree<00:02:18.430> angle<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.790> carve<00:02:22.030> back

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
a 45 degree angle I like to carve back

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.320 
a 45 degree angle I like to carve back
in<00:02:22.720> there

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.970 

okay<00:02:26.790> there<00:02:27.790> we<00:02:27.970> go<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.600> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
okay there we go this is going to be a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.240 
okay there we go this is going to be a
squint-eyed<00:02:29.980> which<00:02:30.970> spirit<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.770> pretty<00:02:32.770> simple

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
squint-eyed which spirit a pretty simple

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.220 
squint-eyed which spirit a pretty simple
basic<00:02:33.790> generic<00:02:34.390> wood<00:02:35.140> spirit<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.630> slight

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
basic generic wood spirit then a slight

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.230 
basic generic wood spirit then a slight
angle<00:02:38.440> I'm<00:02:38.710> going<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.890> curl<00:02:39.250> back<00:02:39.700> around<00:02:40.770> and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
angle I'm going to curl back around and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.340 
angle I'm going to curl back around and
now<00:02:43.240> my<00:02:43.390> nose<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.960> really<00:02:44.290> starting<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:46.350> stick
