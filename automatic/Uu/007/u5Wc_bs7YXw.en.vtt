00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:29.320

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.140
 alert warning alert is for reading batman 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.850
 the knight of the night ascends hatred or 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.670
 Eyes is the most anticipated movie of the year 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.960
 this time with new protagonists 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.390
 we have batman played by 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.160
 christian bale gatÃºbela played by 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.130
 anne hathaway and the villain bein 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.140
 played by tom hardy good that 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.090
 can you say about this movie I'll just say 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.190
 that is a motherfucker since it is the same 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.140

 history after the death of harvey 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.960
 dent believe that batman was the culprit 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.940
 therefore bruce wayne stays 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.890
 locked in his mansion without doing anything 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.229
 just trying to find a thief 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.670

 doing a rebellion with all the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.040
 prisoners of black hate at the same time the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.140
 policeman is looking for batman to 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 put him in jail for the murder of harvey 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.830
 dent after an epic battle with 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.260
 baseband man loses and they take it to the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 prison where he grew 20 since gothic 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.800
 is in danger for the rebellion of 20 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.230
 that the poor and the prisoners now 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.300
 they dominate the city while the police 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.700
 they were buried in a tunnel where they 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.260
 can escape at the same time bless 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.510
 that has put bombs in various places 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 of gothic more on the bridges since it says 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 that if they try to escape it will blow up 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.330
 the bridge and bruschi in which to find a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.549
 way to escape since the prison is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.340
 a well and once and for all defeat 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.290
 to see the secondary characters continue 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.360
 being the same is jim gordon 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.880

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 the Miranda tight secondary with which 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.430
 I was left with my mouth open when I saw the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.900
 sudden turn of the end interpreted 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.510
 by marion cotillard 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.890

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.200
 demons happened but in the end it does not happen 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.269
 such thing with the end more it seems that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.189
