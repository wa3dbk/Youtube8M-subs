shade<00:01:43.140> cloth<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.650> he<00:01:43.920> hasn't<00:01:44.220> had<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.640> because

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
shade cloth on he hasn't had to because

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
shade cloth on he hasn't had to because
he's<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.509> far<00:01:45.840> advanced<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.500> his

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
he's not that far advanced in his

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.870 
he's not that far advanced in his
production<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> other

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
production like some of the other

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.730 
production like some of the other
growers<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:49.049> soon<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.380> he<00:01:49.470> starts

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
growers are but as soon as he starts

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
growers are but as soon as he starts
getting<00:01:49.950> nice<00:01:50.100> big<00:01:50.369> fruit<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.090> then

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
getting nice big fruit out there then

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
getting nice big fruit out there then
he'll<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:51.990> ahead<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.229> pull<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.740> shake<00:01:53.009> like

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
he'll go ahead and pull that shake like

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670 
he'll go ahead and pull that shake like
everything's<00:01:54.180> magnified<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> Sun

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
everything's magnified in here the Sun

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.130 
everything's magnified in here the Sun
sunlight<00:01:56.369> comes<00:01:57.240> through<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.450> class<00:01:57.780> it's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
sunlight comes through that class it's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
sunlight comes through that class it's
just<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.470> magnifying<00:01:58.950> glass<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
just like a magnifying glass and the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.960 
just like a magnifying glass and the
heat<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.750> magnified

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
heat is so magnified

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.149 
heat is so magnified
they're<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:02.570> passive<00:02:03.170> heated<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.650> passive

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
they're all passive heated and passive

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.469 
they're all passive heated and passive
so<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.670> means<00:02:04.850> we're<00:02:05.000> relying<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
so that means we're relying on the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.290 
so that means we're relying on the
sunshine<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.710> heat<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.100> thing<00:02:07.159> up<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.790> we

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
sunshine to heat this thing up and we

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.729 
sunshine to heat this thing up and we
have<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.780> do<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.670> manually<00:02:10.700> cool<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.630> like<00:02:12.440> that

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
have to do the manually cool I like that

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.430 
have to do the manually cool I like that
that<00:02:13.100> Mike<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.700> went<00:02:14.060> has<00:02:14.330> heat<00:02:14.690> vents<00:02:15.110> put<00:02:15.319> in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
that Mike is went has heat vents put in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440 
that Mike is went has heat vents put in
a<00:02:15.620> simple<00:02:15.980> people<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.670> can't<00:02:16.940> get<00:02:17.120> them<00:02:17.300> there

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
like today get a lot of that excess heat

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.920 
like today get a lot of that excess heat
out<00:02:25.670> there<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.060> keeping<00:02:26.239> them<00:02:26.390> temperatures

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
out there and keeping them temperatures

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.449 
out there and keeping them temperatures
somewhat<00:02:27.739> now<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.250> tough<00:02:28.430> to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
keep it cool but that that peak vent

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.770 
keep it cool but that that peak vent
helps<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.890> lot<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:31.730> then<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.060> saw<00:02:32.300> see<00:02:32.630> they

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
helps a lot but then you saw see they

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.150 
helps a lot but then you saw see they
have<00:02:32.959> roll<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:33.470> sides

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
years and it does work we got to perfect

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.500 
years and it does work we got to perfect
the<00:04:26.070> system<00:04:26.280> but<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.699> a<00:04:26.789> summer<00:04:27.060> fruiting

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
they a little bit of herbicide injury

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.560 
they a little bit of herbicide injury
even<00:05:07.949> just<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.310> herbicide<00:05:08.820> application<00:05:09.479> around

herbicide like that that darn stuff can
just<00:05:15.870> move<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.110> little<00:05:16.440> bit<00:05:16.710> in<00:05:16.919> these<00:05:17.099> tunnels

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
just move a little bit in these tunnels

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.279 
just move a little bit in these tunnels
and<00:05:17.729> just<00:05:17.940> keep<00:05:18.090> floating<00:05:18.449> around<00:05:18.660> in<00:05:19.050> there

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
and just keep floating around in there

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.900 
and just keep floating around in there
and<00:05:19.320> it<00:05:19.560> doesn't<00:05:19.590> break<00:05:20.099> down<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.669> could<00:05:20.760> be

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
and it doesn't break down it could be

and it doesn't break down it could be
you<00:05:21.479> know<00:05:21.599> some<00:05:21.870> I've<00:05:22.260> seen<00:05:22.500> sometimes<00:05:22.949> years

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
you know some I've seen sometimes years

we<00:05:23.820> still<00:05:24.060> leave<00:05:24.270> roundup<00:05:24.750> injury<00:05:25.080> popping<00:05:25.530> up

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
we still leave roundup injury popping up

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.839 
we still leave roundup injury popping up
inside<00:05:26.610> tunnels<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.289> just<00:05:28.289> be<00:05:28.590> very<00:05:28.849> cautious

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
inside tunnels so just be very cautious

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.570 
inside tunnels so just be very cautious
if<00:05:30.060> you're<00:05:30.210> using<00:05:30.360> any<00:05:30.780> types<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.580> chemicals

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
especially Herbert herbicides and

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.030 
especially Herbert herbicides and
tunnels<00:05:34.680> do

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
tunnels do

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.420 
tunnels do
not<00:05:35.130> really<00:05:35.460> get<00:05:35.760> along<00:05:35.880> too<00:05:36.090> well
