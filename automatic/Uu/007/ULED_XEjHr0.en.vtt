00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
goals you know and so it was just about

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369

going<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.270> early<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.260> one

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
going get one early kind of get one

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.959

again<00:00:58.500> after<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> responding<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.789> think

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
again after and responding and I think

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.680 
again after and responding and I think
we<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.239> bonded<00:01:00.420> very<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.960> well<00:01:02.570> little<00:01:03.570> bit

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
we just bonded very very well little bit

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
we just bonded very very well little bit

but nothing gave me the first half you
know<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> thought<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> pressure

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720

on I mean second half and we look like

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
on I mean second half and we look like
we<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.330> opened<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.689> time<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.170> time

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
we we could have opened up time and time

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.600
