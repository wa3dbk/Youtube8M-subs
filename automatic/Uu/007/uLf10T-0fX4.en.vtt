that if they speak about the concerns on
the<00:01:16.770> movement<00:01:17.100> they'll<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.400> attacked<00:01:17.759> just

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the movement they'll be attacked just

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969

like<00:01:18.330> Felicia<00:01:18.630> Day<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.320> many<00:01:19.470> other<00:01:19.770> women

Felicia day's attack might have been the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
Felicia day's attack might have been the
moment<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> world<00:01:28.500> woke<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.130> because
