00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.170
 my grandson andrea when you come to 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 finding me always plays in this corner 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.740
 on the floor on the floor as you see there is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.049
 the carpet 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.360
 but I would also like to cover the walls 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 so as to make this warmer 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.550
 space games on DIY easy I have 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.220
 discovered how pleasant the cork is 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.070
 applied to the walls will certainly like it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.689
 also in andrea 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.670
 cork for covering is possible 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.250
 buy in rectangular elements 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.050
 squares but also the roll along the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 skirting boards we apply an adhesive tape 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 with maxi pro x not masking cloth 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.790
 overflow with the glue we use the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.190
 rectangular and cork elements 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.989
 we prepare the special flooring adhesive 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.100
 and coatings Pattex decent mix 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.140
 the adhesive before applying it to the wall 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.030
 a spatula we take the adhesive and take it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.250
 we transfer to the larger spatula it is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.930
 equipped with teeth 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.000
 we spread the adhesive on the wall with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.129
 slow and regular movements of the spatula 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.930
 toothed 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 we try to uniformly cover the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.100
 surface we cover at most one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 square meter of wall 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's proceed by applying the elements in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.659
 redundant that are placed against the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.310
 wall starting from the bottom and pressed with 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.310
 attention against the adhesive 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.700
 let's continue with the coupon application 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.220
 the cork so that the joints 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 they fall as staggered as when they are done 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.619
 brick walls around obstacles 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.229
 like windows and doors 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.250
 we find the spaces left empty and there 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.250
 we report on the cork 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.659
 with the cutter I cut the cork per 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.619
 to obtain the shapes suitable to occupy the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.619
 spaces left empty 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.670
 after applying the adhesive on the wall 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.090
 we place the element in position 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 cut we pass to the finishing with a 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.100
 self-adhesive bead border a 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.320
 we protect the edge protection 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.300
 we extend the latter along the edge 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.090
 upper part of the cork making it stick 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.610
 well on the wall it is really true that i 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.180
 natural materials are the winners 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.670
 cork and colored and warm does not rot 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.150
 and does not change color with the passage of 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.940
 time 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.640
 in short, what more could you want from 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.720
 a coating for the walls and then it will be 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.720
