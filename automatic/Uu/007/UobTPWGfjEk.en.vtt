a true 7 seater we actually worked the

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.730 
a true 7 seater we actually worked the
plane<00:01:28.090> view<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.719> all<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.049> corners<00:01:29.530> to

the doors that really open up to greet
the<00:01:41.229> owner<00:01:41.590> as<00:01:41.649> he<00:01:41.829> approaches<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.310> vehicle

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
the owner as he approaches the vehicle

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.389 
the owner as he approaches the vehicle
they<00:01:43.509> really<00:01:43.810> invite<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.590> very<00:01:44.859> comfortable

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
they really invite is very comfortable

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.039 
they really invite is very comfortable
ingress<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.359> vehicle

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
ingress to the vehicle

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.170 
ingress to the vehicle
so<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.770> very<00:01:48.039> welcoming<00:01:48.520> touch<00:01:48.789> as<00:01:49.030> well

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
so is a very welcoming touch as well

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.750 
so is a very welcoming touch as well
it's<00:01:49.539> like<00:01:49.600> rolling<00:01:49.930> out<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.320> red

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
it's like rolling out the red

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.210 
it's like rolling out the red
we<00:01:51.300> have<00:01:51.690> designed<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.590> end<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> car

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
we have designed back end of the car

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.330 
we have designed back end of the car
with<00:01:53.520> one-piece<00:01:54.210> tailgate<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.160> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
with one-piece tailgate we think that it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
with one-piece tailgate we think that it
will<00:01:56.520> offer<00:01:57.140> everything<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.410> split

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
will offer everything that the split

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
will offer everything that the split
pail<00:01:59.010> gate<00:01:59.310> offers<00:02:00.210> today<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.740> more

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
pail gate offers today but in a lot more

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.860 
pail gate offers today but in a lot more
convenient<00:02:02.550> way<00:02:02.730> and<00:02:02.970> these<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.270> only<00:02:03.540> thanks

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
convenient way and these is only thanks

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.320 
convenient way and these is only thanks
to<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.770> clever<00:02:05.160> fresh<00:02:05.820> approach<00:02:06.300> to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
to a very clever fresh approach to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.290 
to a very clever fresh approach to
injury<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.410> stand<00:02:07.830> on<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.700> load<00:02:08.940> floor

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
injury you can stand on the load floor

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.890 
injury you can stand on the load floor
and<00:02:09.600> actually<00:02:10.020> view<00:02:10.860> over<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> car<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.810> if

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and actually view over the car so if

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.020 
and actually view over the car so if
you're<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> racing<00:02:13.590> event<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.100> example<00:02:14.550> you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
you're a racing event for example you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.060 
you're a racing event for example you
can<00:02:15.210> be<00:02:15.330> stood<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.780> platform<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.920> your

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
can be stood on that platform with your

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.070 
can be stood on that platform with your
binoculars<00:02:17.280> watching<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> race<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
binoculars watching the race I think the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.310 
binoculars watching the race I think the
entire<00:02:19.350> design<00:02:19.980> team<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.490> very<00:02:21.330> proud<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:22.050> what

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
entire design team is very proud of what

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.560 
entire design team is very proud of what
we've<00:02:22.530> achieved<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:24.030> really<00:02:24.210> just<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
we've achieved and it's really just a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.900 
we've achieved and it's really just a
taster<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.950> we'll<00:02:26.130> achieve<00:02:26.460> with

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
taster of what we'll achieve with

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.430 
taster of what we'll achieve with
Discovery<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.570> future

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
Discovery in the future

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:38.640 
Discovery in the future
Oh

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650
