00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.290
 him 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.130
 fashion 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 a country 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:54.170
 this one take this video of the beginning of the token 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.780
 a topic that I would like to break 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.590
 this topic will be a plus 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.050
 what is blues is an english word 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.930
 which means longing either like 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.290
 slang blue longing 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 but it's not that longing which kind of menu a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.750
 melancholy that makes a person 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.979
 can talk 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.950
 Speaking about ant plus, I would like to say 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.650
 that this is not just musicality this 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 akin to religion that is plus this language 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.810
 on which a person turns to and chance in 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.050
 In this case, we will use 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.340
 of course it is this musical language 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:40.020
 which consists of notes consists of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.539
 techniques that is it also 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.759
 very language like in any other we will 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.250
 learn it instead of letters take minutes but 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.860
 you will be here instead of words 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.700
 sequences of these notes that is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.740
 these will be the words 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.300
 that is, we will not use here 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.649
 human words can here 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.710
 use words which we will have 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.090
 consist of dead languages will argue 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 offered music as 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 national side we will paint 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.849
 this is all using technical equipment 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.790
 that is, all sorts of techniques 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.010
 which we will have involved 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.520
 suspenders all sorts of pnd slides very 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.260
 a lot of price that is, it will be 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.460
 national side of our communication 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.150
 of our conversation and so we will begin 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.290
 if we for love your one it means 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.730
 walk on work being pentatonic 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.210
 pentatonic scale consisting of drinking it 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.590
 roughly speaking scales 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.370
 which has such a specific 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.800
 coloring 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.410
 a little chinese sound you need 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.880
 specifically we remember that there is more 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.370
 called architectonics 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.280
 with someone this is 5 that is consisting of five 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.550
 notes can still be boxing star or position 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.650
 either the fingering option can 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.960
 play with any fret we will do it 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.370
 with the fifth here we are constantly tits 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.370
 strictly on the first string 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:15.560
 pointer we will have referred 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:21.010
 one 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.350
 this is the first string on the 1st fret further 1 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.290
 rate 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.290
 same with whom she is 2 episode 7 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.940
 further 3 article you do not go for 7 days 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.940
 who in the fifth year of this finger 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.650
 that you have a bad dream and signal 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.760
 i live 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.760
 I mean the right to vote. 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.310
 sixth string 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.310
 Now 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.310
 eight 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:09.150
 and so once more Leslie may be a mistake 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.150
 water and livestream 8 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.890
 something about your can 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.000
 through the help of an evil erotic self 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.000
 obey 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 composition 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.370
 so here it is somehow not to the magic 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.150
 satiated if you can not hear 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.150
 Chinese sense 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.720
 suit 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.880
 this is a low hike to simple language can 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.580
 say something 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 certain notes to addresses about which 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.680
 we need to extract 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.680
 need to lead 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.070
 all notes that such bad 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.330
 you will suffer a little 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:12.700
 more cost element in order to 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.040
 we were only one red part and so 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.530
 once more this box called 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.530
 pentatonic can be viewed from above 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.810
 this will take the hurry up 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.700
 this 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.270
 if you want to 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.270
 Schukin 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.740
 come on 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.040
 either bottom up it will be 1 7 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.550
 went into yellow 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.550
 take 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.660
 I will tell you that this box is 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.130
 pentatonic this gamma this apple is like 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.710
 smart option 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.690
 we can play from 5th to 5th fret also 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.860
 we can judge another is your task 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.970
 learn not the same to you left hand 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.970
 remembered the centimeter strip 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.650
 language 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.169
 you can memorize the district i dream about in 5 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.250
 but sleep and try figure play on 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.250
 brought pretty 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.340
 then try playing the living rooms 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:10.639
 I also want to say that Windows. 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.419
 this is the basis of almost all music 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.379
 which we now have pleasure 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:18.509
 listen to metal 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:20.719
 roughly speaking that is it can 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:24.089
 be challenged but she is present everywhere 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:25.649
 in metal in the same in the same pop 

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:29.909
 blues jazz 

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:32.099
 hard rock hardanger all styles vs 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:35.519
 heavy metal pentatonic 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:37.619
 this is the foundation that is it is rather around 

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:39.989
 which builds almost all the walls 

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:44.129
 including jazz and deadlines 

00:07:39.989 --> 00:07:46.529
 you need anything so you can 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:50.099
 treat this as a quarrel and always 

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:52.349
 remember that it is practically like all that 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:54.449
 I happen to you very following videos 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:57.089
 in this video, your task is to learn this 

00:07:54.449 --> 00:08:01.469
 boxing this fingering called 

00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:06.259
 pentatonic important position you learn 

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:06.259
 do this to your left hand 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.330
 readiness currents
