00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:15.640
 on the theme of decoration for the 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:16.660
 terrarium here hugo what belongs in 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.600
 a lean theory 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.340
 Let's start with the red sox that's his 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.810
 she is the box in fashion 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.920
 machine he kept the moist 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.260
 when they turn to each other 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.180
 We want to have an example today 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.570
 a home -made from an ice floe 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.239
 ice crate with a bit of tile adhesive 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:41.190
 and styrofoam keep the machine moist 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.190
 the other can be found here 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.550
 that is also a home -made that was 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.370
 the first point is the second point 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.870
 the plants so it should be on everyone 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.250
 be a real one in this case 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.200
 for example moisture 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.200
 is sucked in here for example a 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.010
 real ones here 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.290
 then we have the wrong here spurious 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.190
 with claes and right 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.560
 this then serves as a hiding place 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.680
 for the beat that was the second 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.299
 point the third point are the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.439
 Storage space here we have one 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.840
 tray area because there is a village fritz 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.729
 is where the red box is on 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.270
 So we have four storage areas for 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.860
 two slops that is very optimal 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.229
 the next point is the water bowl 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.930
 Therefore drink for the snake supplies 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.890
 or for other reptile and the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.659
 then we still have airiness 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.500
 the crawl possibilities here we have 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.939
 found a very big branch outside 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 to crank them over it 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.180
 you can steal greeks and here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.710
 and last but not least we have here 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 a few hiding opportunities 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.470
 Here we have a basket piece 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.380
 chosen because it is very good here 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.820
 has fit in and below the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.259
 You may not recognize it so well, though 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.009
 We also have a basket 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.329
 posed 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.720
 that will sometimes strike 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.369
 Yes, that was it 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.229
 slim from both and here again 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.229
 that the hari at a glance
