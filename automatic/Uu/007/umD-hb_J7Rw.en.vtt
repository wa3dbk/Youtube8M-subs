wasn't portrayed in the same way
Maradona<00:05:18.550> because<00:05:18.850> he<00:05:18.940> didn't<00:05:19.180> do<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.479> but

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720

he still took loads of things it was a

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.219 
he still took loads of things it was a
genius<00:05:21.940> indeed<00:05:22.330> that's<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.780> fair<00:05:22.960> point

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229
