00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
alright time for the dragging finger

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.630 
alright time for the dragging finger
exercise<00:00:03.540> no<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.130> related<00:00:05.609> to

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
especially closely related to the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.839 
especially closely related to the
polishing<00:00:10.050> finger<00:00:10.410> board<00:00:10.620> thing<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.519> 1<00:00:11.700> 2

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
polishing finger board thing and the 1 2

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.610 
polishing finger board thing and the 1 2
3<00:00:11.969> 4<00:00:12.179> 5<00:00:12.300> sticky<00:00:12.630> finger<00:00:12.900> okay<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.410> it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
3 4 5 sticky finger okay because it's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.460 
3 4 5 sticky finger okay because it's
essentially<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.700> same<00:00:14.730> motion<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.139> slow

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
essentially the same motion but in slow

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.189 
essentially the same motion but in slow
motion<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.460> take<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> look<00:00:17.850> at<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.109> what<00:00:19.109> I'm

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
motion so take a look at this what I'm

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.650 
motion so take a look at this what I'm
gonna<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> start<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.220> put<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.600> to

gonna do to start is put I'm going to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
gonna do to start is put I'm going to
put<00:00:21.750> myself<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.140> fourth<00:00:22.380> position<00:00:22.609> with<00:00:23.609> my

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
put myself up in fourth position with my

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.429 
put myself up in fourth position with my
fingers<00:00:24.359> between<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> strings<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.230> I've<00:00:25.289> got

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
fingers between the strings so I've got

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.370 
fingers between the strings so I've got
first<00:00:26.099> finger<00:00:26.369> between<00:00:26.550> C<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.090> G<00:00:27.380> second

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
first finger between C and G second

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.990 
first finger between C and G second
finger<00:00:28.560> between<00:00:28.710> G<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.039> D<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.490> third<00:00:29.760> finger

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
finger between G and D and third finger

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
finger between G and D and third finger
between<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.900> D<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.289> fourth<00:00:31.590> fingers<00:00:31.830> just

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
between a and D and fourth fingers just

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.110 
between a and D and fourth fingers just
kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> hanging<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.550> doing<00:00:32.700> nothing<00:00:32.850> for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
kind of hanging out doing nothing for

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.860 
kind of hanging out doing nothing for
now<00:00:33.390> alright<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> move<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.450> arm

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
now alright now I'm going to move my arm

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.920 
now alright now I'm going to move my arm
back<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.670> my<00:00:38.670> fingers<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
back and my fingers just because of the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.240 
back and my fingers just because of the
friction<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> fingerboard<00:00:40.680> they're<00:00:41.040> kind

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
friction of the fingerboard they're kind

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
friction of the fingerboard they're kind
of<00:00:41.340> gonna<00:00:41.460> elongate<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.020> smoosh<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of gonna elongate and then smoosh up and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.819 
of gonna elongate and then smoosh up and
then<00:00:44.340> elongate<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.149> smush<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.800> so

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
then elongate and smush up all right so

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
then elongate and smush up all right so
it's<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.430> arm<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.420> initiating<00:00:48.960> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it's my arm that is initiating this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.490 
it's my arm that is initiating this
motion<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.879> my<00:00:50.879> fingers<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.329> dragging<00:00:52.199> along

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
motion and my fingers are dragging along

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
motion and my fingers are dragging along
behind<00:00:53.300> okay<00:00:54.620> now<00:00:55.620> you'll<00:00:55.800> notice<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.390> my

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
behind okay now you'll notice that my

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.160 
behind okay now you'll notice that my
arm<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:59.239> there's<00:01:00.239> nothing<00:01:00.660> happening<00:01:00.899> at

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
arm is not there's nothing happening at

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
arm is not there's nothing happening at
my<00:01:01.350> wrist<00:01:01.649> okay<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.059> staying<00:01:03.390> as

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
my wrist okay so this this is staying as

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.789 
my wrist okay so this this is staying as
one<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:05.070> flat<00:01:05.489> line<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.530> okay<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> again

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
one one flat line here okay and again

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850 
one one flat line here okay and again
it's<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.180> move<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:10.020> arm<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.560> fingers

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's just I move my arm back my fingers

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.330 
it's just I move my arm back my fingers
drag<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.400> moving<00:01:11.729> forward<00:01:12.060> they<00:01:12.210> smush<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
drag I moving forward they smush up and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.090 
drag I moving forward they smush up and
so<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.240> vibrating<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.860> say<00:01:17.070> I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so when you are vibrating let's say I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.340 
so when you are vibrating let's say I
speed<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> make<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> little

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
speed this up and and make it a little

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.070 
speed this up and and make it a little
smaller<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> finger<00:01:21.210> flexibility<00:01:21.930> we've

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
smaller the finger flexibility we've

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.859 
smaller the finger flexibility we've
been<00:01:22.259> talking<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> result<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.240> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
been talking about is a result of this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.320 
been talking about is a result of this
drag<00:01:25.320> okay<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> friction<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
drag okay so it's the friction on the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.440 
drag okay so it's the friction on the
strings<00:01:27.799> that<00:01:28.799> make<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.759> finger<00:01:30.119> jiggle

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
strings that make your finger jiggle

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
strings that make your finger jiggle
it's<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.799> moving<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.280> finger<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's not you moving your finger that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's not you moving your finger that
make<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.420> finger<00:01:33.630> jiggle<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
make your finger jiggle right so if I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
make your finger jiggle right so if I
can<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.229> feeling<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:38.070> allowing<00:01:38.579> them<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
can get this feeling of allowing them to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.530 
can get this feeling of allowing them to
drag<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.680> speed<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.390> maybe<00:01:42.390> just

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
drag then when I speed it up maybe just

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.630 
drag then when I speed it up maybe just
change<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.770> finger<00:01:44.040> it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
change it so it's just one finger it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
change it so it's just one finger it's
continuing<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> dragon<00:01:46.409> smush<00:01:49.040> okay

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
continuing to do that dragon smush okay

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.399 
continuing to do that dragon smush okay
so<00:01:50.759> again<00:01:51.060> starting<00:01:51.810> fourth<00:01:52.229> position

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
so again starting fourth position

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.830 
so again starting fourth position
fingers<00:01:53.399> between<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.180> strings<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:56.509> my<00:01:57.509> arm

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
fingers between the strings and my arm

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
fingers between the strings and my arm
motion<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.619> what's<00:01:58.799> starting<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.430> this<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
motion is what's starting it this is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
motion is what's starting it this is
staying<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:01.020> line

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
staying as one line

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.300 
staying as one line
my<00:02:02.070> fingers<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.880> simply<00:02:03.540> dragging<00:02:04.310> along

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
