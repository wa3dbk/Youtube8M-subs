00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.100
 and why the bench 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.889
 in the kitchen there never entered what there is 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.299
 the tail is a hat 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.270
 perhaps there was a little piece but that goodness 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.030
 but you want it will always be a wine outside 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.250
 but what goodness but goodness 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.980
 or this stuff here but what goodness but 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.320
 What do you want 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.140
 if we can aspire to focus but that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.119
 pulsate 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.280
 it works bye to everyone today for that but 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.160
 goodness we find ourselves in capoliveri in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.800
 company of luca arduini ciao luca e 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.230
 we are at the restaurant da pilade then 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.970
 what do you cook for us today? 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.680
 so today I'm going to make one 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.930
 person with fish in our seas and that 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.210
 let's say and do the valascia need 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.489
 of the ingredients what they are will be the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.109
 person the essential basis 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.930
 we have minced garlic and parsley 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.699
 salt and a mixture of white wine and oil 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.899
 extra virgin olive oil that we produce in 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.810
 company then listen to this for a moment 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.490
 fish for how many people but let's say that 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 this is a fish that not generally 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 we serve for two people for two people 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.399
 perfect then before starting with with 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.810
 using the process I wanted to ask you the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.460
 the ember asks how long before it goes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.039
 turned on peace then like an hour e 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.750
 half before the ships of our 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.590
 stain away our vegetation 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.360
 The summer olive tree is lit an hour 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.070
 and a half before when I start work 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.720
 to see this we can here 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.439
 proceed to the item here so yes 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.880
 understands that embers are ready when not 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.000
 there is more we are of course for i 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.170
 pieces of wood are the white elements 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.149
 okay then luca 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.780
 let's start with the proceedings of the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.310
 flat meanwhile having already understood the fish 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.990
 high scaled of the entrails 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.380
 they proceeded with a cut that must 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.709
 be of horizontal to say a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.690
 follow the fish analyst not because i 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.640
 cut the fish then this one there 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.120
 will serve first to get caught 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 better chaos and then to check the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 cooking 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.990
 on the finish so you also cut for 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.930
 see at the end to see if it is cooked 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.800
 the fish or the fish is not cooked after 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.790
 having made these decisions 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 let 's make peace with half a spoon 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.090
 of rice 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.510
 at this point we spread the embers e 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.160
 peace let's take that a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.989
 a little bit more dull what does it mean 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.660
 extend the embers 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.700
 we practically lay it on the plan of 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:03:03.570
 cooking where then we go to put the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:03.570
 fish on the grill choose why 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.200
 feel at the brazier is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.239
 important is the height of the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.850
 know our comfort if you 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.010
 heights of the brazier and height of one waist 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.890
 who naturally works manager then the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.769
 fish should stand at a height of about 10 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.019
 centimeters from the embers that must be 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.170
 shot very often now I do 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.170
 to see 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.350
 good boy 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.620
 we extend on the folder with the mixture 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.010
 of oil and white wine and a small brush 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.710
 of the smarino is made to pineto or rosemino 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.770
 like pennesi a brush of rosemary 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.860
 that comes is a very simple thing 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:03.010
 tied like a normal thing to do so 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.500
 by this we mean brush it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.500
 so from both sides 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.140
 this one during cooking is a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.260
 procedure that is very often at all 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.440
 to those always repeat it every world 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.180
 whenever we turn it we say the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.350
 first time we knew each other 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.570
 must be immediately robbery almost after 30 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.510
 seconds light of a minute of need 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.600
 to shoot it the first time twice then 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.110
 when the voracious lose strength then it 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.530
 let's turn around a little bit I felt more or less 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.850
 how much is the cooking time for the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.850
 quarter size twenty minutes 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.170
 we have so much the first turn 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.650
 we respect 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.650
 now we have it 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:04.990
 and sprinkle with salt a little 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:07.869
 sprinkles will be homogeneous sprinkling 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.149
 you also hear the repeated salewa over everything 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:12.279
 every time I have only the first time from one 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:15.270
 part from the other once on the sun and the 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:19.599
 salt is only once then at the end 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.999
 once only here after about a minute 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.939
 we have given the first tirade we see 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:28.959
 immediately another 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:32.019
 we repeat the process the oil and the 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:34.599
 wine and it was another sprinkling of 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:37.719
 balances from the side that one was not 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.269
 date and you immediately put back slow cooking 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:43.539
 feel the oil inside this one 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:50.259
 extra virgin olive oil sauce is really 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:53.709
 what you do whites then later 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:56.699
 15 minutes several turns and brush 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:06:02.069
 by pezzogna sea bream ready 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.069
 perfect so good simple door 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.100
 we aspire to serve on a plate with 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.010
 of the rocket feast with the foreigner with the 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.900
 fishing and as I said before the engraving 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.930
 they are used to control cooking i 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.060
 so we still had this check 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.160
 we will try to move the fillet when 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.600
 we see that the bone comes off well 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.790
 from the pulp it is on pink yes if it were white 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.150
 would be overcooked on pink so the 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.180
 person we put a little oil on a 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.180
 raw 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.300
 and we are there and the person is ready 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.889
 so luca cooked us the pezzoni 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.919
 grilled now we ask Francesco 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.419
 who wine can be combined with this 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.210
 our flat system okay 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:55.650
 I would recommend this winery arrivals 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.750
 of a dry white wine with a name 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.340
 curious among other things it was now because or 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.310
 unless you wait 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.250
 it is a wine made up of three 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.490
 travels chardonnay pinot bianco and manzoni 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.830
 it is a minus that goes well with fish 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.340
 with fish appetizers and us it 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.340
 highly recommend 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.020
 because how come the bench 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.980
 in the kitchen I do n't go in here, that's what happens from 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:30.100
 power maybe there was a little bit but that 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.460
 goodness but you always want to robin water 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:38.530
 but what goodness but goodness but this stuff 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:42.990
 here but if this morning but that pulsate 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.990
 that works but that stuff is here
