00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.910
 ok hi to all and rmc hugo no ego 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.169
 so that's the first tip so we 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.250
 lan au pl named the trick jgb hockey 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.020
 together you still do not know what 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.220
 we are going to try to think 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 together at what it takes for 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.910
 to caress and reflect 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.830
 currently in dofus most of 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.610
 people and are rather than at the level they 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.840
 are audio so they'll do like 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.170
 mules I rarely have people they are 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.780
 detainees to mount them anyway a 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.699
 step 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.949
 intermediaries have almost every 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.660
 persos think that all your characters to you 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.550
 hoist in flat areas anyway without 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.260
 go through this stage which is the island of 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.059
 pins buy in self miles so the famous 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 island that arrive a few years ago 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.619
 of this because little revolutionized was this 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.210
 with his boxer with his top will be very 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.720
 flexible and I sui team that everyone 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.430
 looking to see brief so otomai have 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.860
 took advantage to go on this island there are 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.470
 quests to do and we'll see how 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.509
 to be done on it is built again 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.450
 on the interface created a character yes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.670
 so you have to be two for this trick 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.270
 so your personal and why if you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 have a friend 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 that's the answer can create a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.670
 sue character whose fight we're going 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 do what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.360
 you will take a character earth 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.490
 it's understand that we do not care 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.960
 at the same time a little hop we do 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.600
 belpech ii 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.790
 note mitch redhead west ham is 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.790
 not happy this rasta unit 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.450
 ok so we'll call it how the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.159
 peaceful yes I like this one yes 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 yes here is very well create ok we get 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.180
 found on the beginning interface of the game 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.819
 so the goal is going to go suffocate a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 so let's get rid of 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.870
 royal so let's go for this technique 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.370
 it must of course be subscribed yes 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 but you will see that even the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.680
 added value is worth 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.489
 so you have to subscribers whose accounts 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.230
 you want to dye in friends for example 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.700
 so after leaving incarnam you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.549
 get to your status you have 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.299
 recorded 2 ap to strubbe and then he goes 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.420
 have to go down all the way 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.390
 suffocating tree put in two times two 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.190
 go there 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 ok here is ozap above focal so is the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.650
 purpose of the game now is to get 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.120
 find more than six boats to the island 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.480
 from otomai so do you all the joints 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.470
 these parties have mostly the left is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.980
 so here we are in 15 28 in front of some 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.690
 200 whip captain craddock so these 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.620
 parties to accept this year on the island 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.739
 agreed to bring supplies 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.780
 so if we click on the quest we see 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.850
 that you have to bring back two arrows a big 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.200
 ball an ear and an oil of 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.250
 sesame and us what will interest us 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.410
 these big shots and yes it's when we have 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.709
 we usually go and buy it 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.620
 we do not want the drop is so 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.989
 any act i will be based on that because 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.190
 in fact when you have the quest in 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.120
 course the new world automatically 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.280
 if you do a rollmops fight 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.410
 will want peace so seemed the technique 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.880
 is simple is to debate 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.709
 roadmaps but on the other hand how 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.180
 healthy levels his crazy wick debate 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.900
 so that's why it takes a 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.150
 second person to yield their due when 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.290
 fight so it's next party 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.970
 step the roles maps so while 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.920
 we are on the way from suffolk to 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.200
 little click on the little video for 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.049
 have for the little trick for them 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.430
 clods show his door 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.889
 ok here we go there is rollmops so 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.039
 so you're just so the zap who 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.690
 leads it's the least in 20 so 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.509
 to go there it's simple 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.150
 draw a straight line up to 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.520
 around the market all that happens to you 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.850
 ozap you go down and we end up 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.240
 so just here take for example a 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.240
 roll mops you do so black 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.289
 of course we manage to do that 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.289
 like it should be 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.410
 and as you see the big ball has 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.750
 been doped by casino and yes or for a 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.980
 fight that lasted forty seconds 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.210
 the only disadvantage is that it takes 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.120
 of weight so you're going to have to do 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.440
 go back or if you have my 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.970
 body character who has a lot to say 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680
 that's otherwise will give a character 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.450
 able and not necessarily when I arrive 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.740
 at 10000 also poses the others 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:24.950
 resources that may interest you 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:30.140
 that's what's top also it's the 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:32.510
 legs come back to 3 then against 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.060
 it's technical it works nickel 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.290
 frankly nothing to say about this 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.660
 technique is really perfect in 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.700
 revenge if you are several to the 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.010
 do at the same time the prices are going 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.540
 go down and in the end it will be completely 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.830
 limited so here it is a small 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.790
 music must be used when prices 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.560
 are relative to the mcbb and that's it not 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.440
 do it all the time not with 5 wholesale 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.820
 to the web is what in the end it deprives 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.770
 you take a small dozen small 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.240
 maybe twenty and see you 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.360
 sell them and this from really 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.840
 very well so especially pay attention to 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.040
 do not abuse it if not store your fat 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.270
 cannonball we can do it you can 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.680
 store the low cost collar you 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.680
 make a big ball day then 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.080
 here you put all in bank 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.160
 and that's what you're jumping 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.270
 stocks and as soon as you see that the 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:27.030
 Prices are ironed in soft green and 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.820
 three so that's ten minutes of 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.640
 fight I have this big ball 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.800
 so we go the multi 7.6 facets 40-40 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.710
 will have to take 40 go reading 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.720
 always fall on 40 40 40 that we 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.000
 go 40 play in one hour that's 1,800 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.520
 miles per hour wallace and it's not 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.810
 badly so must the bettors store them 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.460
 pushing 40 not possibly 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.560
 you make an hour of her hen 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.530
 and store or keep that dolls 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.990
 sales in hd and listen well we hope 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.210
 that this video will have pleased you 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.400
 found in a few days for a 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.440
 new video do not hesitate to go 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.520
 but he shared and of course to 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.800
 subscribers to subscribe 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.800
 of course go hi hi
