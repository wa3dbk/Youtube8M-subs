chunks<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> foam<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> them<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.610> if

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
chunks of foam out of them and also if

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000 
chunks of foam out of them and also if
you<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.180> grass<00:00:51.590> these<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.800> white

you take them on grass these are white

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.970 
you take them on grass these are white
rims<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.940> you're<00:00:54.270> gonna<00:00:54.360> stain<00:00:54.780> them<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.350> green

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
rims so you're gonna stain them to green

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
rims so you're gonna stain them to green
and<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.239> look<00:00:57.360> very<00:00:57.420> good<00:00:58.309> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and it's not gonna look very good but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.000 
and it's not gonna look very good but
anyways<00:01:00.030> these<00:01:00.719> models<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.739> these

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
anyways these models right here these

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
anyways these models right here these
are<00:01:02.219> high<00:01:02.609> profile<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.320> means<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.739> have

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
are high profile that means they have

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
are high profile that means they have
thicker<00:01:05.309> foam<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> top<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
thicker foam at the top they do make a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.920 
thicker foam at the top they do make a
low<00:01:07.650> profile<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> thumbs<00:01:08.970> hat<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
low profile to where the thumbs hat is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500 
low profile to where the thumbs hat is
thick<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.850> sure<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
thick and I'm pretty sure they do that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410 
thick and I'm pretty sure they do that
for<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> higher<00:01:13.110> speed<00:01:13.590> runs<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.790> these<00:01:15.150> right

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
for a higher speed runs but these right

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
for a higher speed runs but these right
here<00:01:15.750> these<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:15.990> perfect<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> blending<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
here these are perfect for a blending on

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.749 
here these are perfect for a blending on
Motorz<00:01:18.860> that's<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.100> running<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.930> see

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
Motorz that's what I'm running but see

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
Motorz that's what I'm running but see
these<00:01:23.759> tires<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.270> best<00:01:24.570> when<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> road<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> dry

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
these tires do best when the road is dry

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.480 
these tires do best when the road is dry
so<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.299> them<00:01:27.650> out<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so if you take them out on some kind of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
so if you take them out on some kind of
hard<00:01:29.909> road<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.869> kind<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> wet<00:01:31.259> outside

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
hard road it's kind of wet outside

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
hard road it's kind of wet outside
you're<00:01:31.680> gonna<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.920> spinning<00:01:32.369> tires<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.670> lot

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you're gonna be spinning tires a lot

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.390 
you're gonna be spinning tires a lot
because<00:01:33.570> these<00:01:33.900> tires<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.619> completely<00:01:34.890> flat

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
because these tires are completely flat

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
because these tires are completely flat
they're<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.180> rubber<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.930> grab

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
they're not like rubber they don't grab

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.740 
they're not like rubber they don't grab
into<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.890> surface<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.450> keep<00:01:39.630> your

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
into the surface they just keep your

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.810 
into the surface they just keep your
tires<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.229> loading<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.960> about<00:01:42.960> bloating<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
tires from loading and about bloating is

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
tires from loading and about bloating is
are<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.970> guys<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> rubber<00:01:45.720> tires<00:01:46.020> for

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
are you guys with the rubber tires for

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.819 
are you guys with the rubber tires for
example<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.460> ones<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> front<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.829> didn't

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
example these ones on the front I didn't

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
example these ones on the front I didn't
see<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.310> kind<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> soft<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.540> can

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
see these are kind of soft and I can

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
see these are kind of soft and I can
squish<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:52.290> upwards<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.460> had<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.820> on

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
squish them upwards if I had these on

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.899 
squish them upwards if I had these on
the<00:01:54.180> back<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.049> floored<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.430> tire<00:01:56.700> would

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the back and I floored it the tire would

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.620 
the back and I floored it the tire would
expand<00:01:57.509> upward<00:01:58.490> causing<00:01:59.490> me<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> lose<00:02:00.000> balance

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
expand upward causing me to lose balance

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.069 
expand upward causing me to lose balance
and<00:02:01.790> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:03.240> off<00:02:03.390> track<00:02:03.750> when<00:02:03.960> I'm

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and kind of go off track when I'm

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.709 
and kind of go off track when I'm
driving<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.040> why<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> run<00:02:05.430> foams<00:02:05.759> they

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
driving so that's why you run foams they

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.510 
driving so that's why you run foams they
don't<00:02:06.899> blow<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.829> keep<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.160> steady

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
don't blow it out and you keep a steady

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
don't blow it out and you keep a steady
pace<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.330> your<00:02:09.780> car<00:02:10.080> doesn't<00:02:10.319> start<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
pace and your car doesn't start to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.990 
pace and your car doesn't start to
wobble<00:02:10.849> really<00:02:11.849> good<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.120> handling

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
wobble really good for handling

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.300 
wobble really good for handling
anyways<00:02:14.000> these<00:02:14.720> Jayco<00:02:15.290> foam<00:02:15.530> tires<00:02:15.920> cost

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
anyways these Jayco foam tires cost

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.309 
anyways these Jayco foam tires cost
about<00:02:16.550> twenty<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.330> twenty-five<00:02:17.810> dollars

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
about twenty to twenty-five dollars

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.680 
about twenty to twenty-five dollars
depending<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.770> where<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.190> your<00:02:19.250> stuff

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.199 

yeah<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.020> they<00:02:24.500> also<00:02:24.650> make<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> front<00:02:25.790> one

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
yeah and they also make a front one

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.510 
yeah and they also make a front one
I<00:02:26.240> run<00:02:26.630> rear<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.410> front<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:27.920> back<00:02:28.040> just

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
I run rear on front and back just

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.430 
I run rear on front and back just
because<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.570> change<00:02:29.780> them<00:02:29.930> out<00:02:30.080> whenever<00:02:30.230> I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
because I can change them out whenever I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.940 
because I can change them out whenever I
want

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
want

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.630 
want
but<00:02:31.910> rear<00:02:32.390> has<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.660> hex<00:02:33.170> one<00:02:33.410> no<00:02:33.920> need<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.280> adapt

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
but rear has a hex one no need to adapt

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.410 
but rear has a hex one no need to adapt
anything<00:02:35.420> else<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.100> front<00:02:37.370> ones<00:02:37.610> they

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
anything else but the front ones they

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.820 
anything else but the front ones they
have<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.630> spot<00:02:38.900> where<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.140> put<00:02:39.350> bearings

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
have a spot where you can put bearings

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.270 
have a spot where you can put bearings
in<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.300> tires<00:02:41.690> spin<00:02:42.200> faster<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:42.920> more

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
in so the tires spin faster and more

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.500 
in so the tires spin faster and more
smooth<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:45.470> yeah<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> short<00:02:47.330> review

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
but the video is pretty short the tires

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.370 
but the video is pretty short the tires
so<00:03:43.510> video<00:03:44.510> wasn't<00:03:44.840> gonna<00:03:44.930> be<00:03:45.079> that<00:03:45.200> long

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380
