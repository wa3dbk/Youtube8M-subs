00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
another thing you had to switch in the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.650 
another thing you had to switch in the
back<00:00:59.239> will<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.260> turn<00:01:00.500> on<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.570> that's<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
back will you turn on and that's the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.000 
back will you turn on and that's the
only<00:01:02.809> thing<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.079> concerned<00:01:03.500> me<00:01:03.559> oh<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.829> turn

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
only thing that concerned me oh you turn

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.590 
only thing that concerned me oh you turn
it<00:01:04.160> on<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.309> then<00:01:04.610> like<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:04.940> lights<00:01:05.180> up<00:01:05.390> real

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
it on and then like it lights up real

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.270 
it on and then like it lights up real
quick<00:01:05.750> I<00:01:05.870> think<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:06.230> just<00:01:06.440> powering<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.980> up

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
quick I think it's just powering it up

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.490 
quick I think it's just powering it up
it<00:01:08.030> has<00:01:08.680> six<00:01:10.150> UV<00:01:11.150> lamps<00:01:11.510> under<00:01:11.810> here<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.350> this

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
it has six UV lamps under here and this

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.090 
it has six UV lamps under here and this
is<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.740> think<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.340> said<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.790> was<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:14.500> 55<00:01:15.500> watt<00:01:15.800> lamp

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
is I think it said it was a 55 watt lamp

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.550 
is I think it said it was a 55 watt lamp
let<00:01:16.580> me<00:01:16.730> check<00:01:18.910> okay<00:01:19.910> so<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.600> says<00:01:20.870> is<00:01:21.110> 6<00:01:21.350> UV

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
let me check okay so it says is 6 UV

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.100 
let me check okay so it says is 6 UV
bulbs<00:01:22.040> deliver<00:01:22.310> 54<00:01:22.820> total<00:01:23.030> watts<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.630> curring

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
bulbs deliver 54 total watts of curring

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.840 
bulbs deliver 54 total watts of curring
power<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.010> 54<00:01:25.520> watts<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.870> fans<00:01:27.850> speeds

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
power so it's 54 watts to fans speeds

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.400 
power so it's 54 watts to fans speeds

what<00:01:41.120> it<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.470> ok<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:42.560> ok<00:01:42.830> with<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.600> 7<00:01:44.600> watt<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
what it is ok so ok with this 7 watt so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.140 
what it is ok so ok with this 7 watt so
it's<00:01:45.170> 54<00:01:45.590> wopsle<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.160> have<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.400> replace<00:01:46.670> 6<00:01:47.000> of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
it's 54 wopsle you have to replace 6 of

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.930 
it's 54 wopsle you have to replace 6 of
them<00:01:47.300> but<00:01:47.860> actually<00:01:48.860> 1<00:01:49.100> 2<00:01:49.490> 3<00:01:49.790> 4<00:01:50.180> 5<00:01:50.480> 6<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.700> came

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
them but actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 so it came

for curing ok so um

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.980 
for curing ok so um
let's<00:02:14.000> go<00:02:14.150> ahead<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.360> turn<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:14.960> I

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
let's go ahead and turn this on there I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.600 
let's go ahead and turn this on there I
can<00:02:15.050> show<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.350> okay<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:15.980> here's<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.490> fan<00:02:18.580> okay

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
can show you okay so here's the fan okay

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.050 
can show you okay so here's the fan okay
now<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:19.910> could<00:02:20.210> also<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.530> power<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
now you could also do the power the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.560 
now you could also do the power the
timer<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.370> went<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.670> two<00:02:25.850> minutes<00:02:26.210> three

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
timer so if I went to two minutes three

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.740 
timer so if I went to two minutes three
minutes<00:02:26.690> four<00:02:27.290> minutes<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:28.550> then<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.630> will

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
minutes four minutes and then that will

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.720 
minutes four minutes and then that will
equal<00:02:30.110> what<00:02:30.290> five<00:02:30.530> minutes<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.310> again<00:02:31.550> now

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
equal what five minutes so it again now

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.970 
equal what five minutes so it again now
we<00:02:31.790> go<00:02:32.060> at<00:02:32.240> four<00:02:32.900> five<00:02:33.080> six<00:02:33.350> minutes<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:33.920> it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
we go at four five six minutes do it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.610 
we go at four five six minutes do it
again<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.940> will<00:02:35.030> equal<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.690> three<00:02:36.080> for<00:02:36.290> like

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
again that will equal the three for like

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.080 
again that will equal the three for like
seven<00:02:36.920> minutes<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.580> keep<00:02:37.760> doing<00:02:38.000> it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
seven minutes so like you keep doing it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.580 
seven minutes so like you keep doing it
and<00:02:38.270> that's<00:02:38.540> what<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.870> does<00:02:38.960> but<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.410> don't

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
and that's what it does but you don't

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.250 
and that's what it does but you don't
need<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.330> do<00:02:41.330> that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
need to do that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.560 
need to do that
