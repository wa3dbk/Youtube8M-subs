right here and instead of giving it a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.880 
right here and instead of giving it a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it a bucket of water it freaks out it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.060 
it a bucket of water it freaks out it
just<00:00:58.980> starts<00:00:59.399> duplicating<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> things

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
just starts duplicating all the things

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.240 
just starts duplicating all the things
refuel<00:01:04.909> look<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:08.040> pay

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
refuel look at that now don't pay

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
refuel look at that now don't pay
attention<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> fuel<00:01:09.060> level<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.380> didn't

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
attention to the fuel level it didn't

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
attention to the fuel level it didn't
actually<00:01:10.920> feel<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.549> turtle<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.119> turtle

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
actually feel the turtle this turtle

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
actually feel the turtle this turtle
happened<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> already<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.490> 21,000<00:01:14.490> fuel<00:01:14.640> in

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
happened to already have 21,000 fuel in

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
happened to already have 21,000 fuel in
it<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.140> free<00:01:16.439> fuel<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it so you don't get free fuel out of it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
it so you don't get free fuel out of it
but<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.240> free<00:01:18.390> buckets<00:01:18.869> why<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but you do get free buckets why is this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.370 
but you do get free buckets why is this
a<00:01:19.710> big<00:01:20.009> deal<00:01:20.180> why<00:01:21.180> would<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> thousand

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a big deal why would I want a thousand

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.740 
a big deal why would I want a thousand
buckets<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.100> might<00:01:23.340> ask<00:01:23.640> well<00:01:24.390> I'll<00:01:24.540> show<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
buckets you might ask well I'll show you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
buckets you might ask well I'll show you
exactly<00:01:25.140> why<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.560> buckets<00:01:26.250> take<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
exactly why you want buckets take this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.710 
exactly why you want buckets take this
thing<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> furnace

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
thing over to a furnace

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.860 
thing over to a furnace
and<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:29.930> cook<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:32.030> for<00:01:32.240> each<00:01:32.450> one<00:01:32.480> of

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
and you cook it and for each one of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.780 
and you cook it and for each one of
these<00:01:32.960> duplicated<00:01:33.710> buckets<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.190> get<00:01:34.490> three

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
these duplicated buckets you get three

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.610 
these duplicated buckets you get three
iron<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:37.250> know<00:01:37.370> you<00:01:37.550> can<00:01:37.700> do<00:01:37.790> with<00:01:37.910> iron

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
iron and you know you can do with iron

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.930 
iron and you know you can do with iron
pretty<00:01:39.620> much<00:01:39.830> everything<00:01:40.430> when<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.790> have

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
pretty much everything when you have

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.120 
pretty much everything when you have
equivalent<00:01:41.300> exchange<00:01:45.550> because<00:01:46.550> iron<00:01:48.130> becomes

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
equivalent exchange because iron becomes

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.180 
equivalent exchange because iron becomes
gold<00:01:49.960> or<00:01:50.960> ender<00:01:51.680> pearls<00:01:52.220> or<00:01:52.850> whatever<00:01:54.190> pretty

gold or ender pearls or whatever pretty

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.400 
gold or ender pearls or whatever pretty
sweet<00:01:55.520> stuff<00:01:55.690> this<00:01:56.690> can<00:01:56.900> be<00:01:57.020> completely

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
sweet stuff this can be completely

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.400 
sweet stuff this can be completely
automated<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.720> have<00:01:59.840> all<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.230> iron

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
automated and you can have all the iron

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:08.500 
automated and you can have all the iron
you<00:02:00.590> want<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:01.100> heard<00:02:01.370> four<00:02:01.580> days<00:02:07.330> okay
