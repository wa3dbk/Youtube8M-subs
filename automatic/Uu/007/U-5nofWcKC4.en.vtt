00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
see we'll go down here we have the
Suites<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.579> ever<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> the

Suites now if you ever been to the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.760 
Suites now if you ever been to the
Superdome<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> you've<00:01:52.259> ever<00:01:52.409> been<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.680> this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
Superdome and you've ever been in this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
Superdome and you've ever been in this
Suites<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.119> know<00:01:54.240> these<00:01:54.360> ones

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
Suites you know that you know these ones

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420 
Suites you know that you know these ones
are<00:01:54.750> pretty<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.890> looks<00:01:56.130> weird

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
are pretty good and it looks weird

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.080 
are pretty good and it looks weird
because<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:57.750> Suites<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> Superdome

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
because the Suites of the Superdome

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.490 
because the Suites of the Superdome
don't<00:02:00.090> look<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.840> anything

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
don't look like you can see anything

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.830 
don't look like you can see anything
because<00:02:02.189> they're<00:02:02.549> literally<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.450> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
because they're literally just like this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.219 
because they're literally just like this
where<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.969> whole<00:02:06.240> sloping<00:02:06.960> area

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
where there is this whole sloping area

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.859 
where there is this whole sloping area
except<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> smooth<00:02:08.129> slope<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
except it's a smooth slope that the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.809 
except it's a smooth slope that the
overhang<00:02:10.289> sees<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.370> why<00:02:11.610> would

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
overhang sees and it's like why would

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
overhang sees and it's like why would
you<00:02:11.910> pay<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.180> money<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.690> sit<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.140> but

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you pay all that money to sit there but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.090 
you pay all that money to sit there but

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it that effect where you can't see

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.690 
it that effect where you can't see
through<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.660> sky<00:02:25.190> that's<00:02:26.190> what<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.430> really

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
through and see sky that's what I really

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.300 
through and see sky that's what I really
really<00:02:26.910> wanted<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> avoid<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:29.100> just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
really wanted to avoid and it's just

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.280 
really wanted to avoid and it's just
really<00:02:29.610> taking<00:02:30.000> shape<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.450> honestly<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.050> this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
really taking shape it honestly is this

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.450 
really taking shape it honestly is this
is<00:02:31.470> been<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.790> my<00:02:32.940> favorite<00:02:33.330> builds<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
is been one of my favorite builds and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.160 
is been one of my favorite builds and
not<00:02:35.460> just<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.910> fact<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.960> it's

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
not just for the fact that you know it's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.520 
not just for the fact that you know it's
a<00:02:37.290> big<00:02:37.560> project<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.700> Russell<00:02:39.090> crafts

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
a big project and it's on Russell crafts

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.940 
a big project and it's on Russell crafts
but<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.680> got<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> lot<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.130> potential<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.850> mean

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
but it's got a lot of potential I mean

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.770 
but it's got a lot of potential I mean
if<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.160> had<00:02:44.250> made<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.610> floor<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> little<00:02:45.660> bit

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
if we had made the floor a little bit

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.240 
if we had made the floor a little bit
bigger<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.260> probably<00:02:46.650> could<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.130> had<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
bigger we probably could have had a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
bigger we probably could have had a
bigger<00:02:47.430> Stadium<00:02:47.910> but<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.780> look<00:02:49.110> at<00:02:49.230> the

the<00:03:48.150> way<00:03:48.240> we<00:03:48.390> did<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.630> stage<00:03:48.870> was<00:03:49.170> how<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.500> came

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
the way we did the stage was how it came

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.260 
the way we did the stage was how it came
up<00:03:49.740> like<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:51.050> almost<00:03:52.050> would<00:03:52.470> prefer<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.270> to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
up like this I almost would prefer it to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.800 
up like this I almost would prefer it to
come<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> problem<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.660> that

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
come like this but the problem is that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.870 
come like this but the problem is that
seems<00:03:58.020> like<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.320> eats<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.650> way<00:03:59.040> too<00:03:59.100> many<00:03:59.520> seats

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
seems like it eats up way too many seats

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.230 
seems like it eats up way too many seats
if<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:01.050> were<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.290> go<00:04:01.440> at<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> one<00:04:01.920> angle<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.580> keep

one one one one one one one one it would

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390 
one one one one one one one one it would

off of versus everybody else that is

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.270 
off of versus everybody else that is
built<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.789> stadium<00:04:56.090> has<00:04:57.020> already<00:04:57.620> had<00:04:57.919> and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
built a stadium has already had and

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.689 
built a stadium has already had and
designed<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:59.000> use<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.410> whether<00:05:00.650> we<00:05:00.860> put<00:05:01.070> X's<00:05:01.550> on

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
designed to use so whether we put X's on

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.159 
designed to use so whether we put X's on
the<00:05:01.820> stage<00:05:02.090> or<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.300> report<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:03.050> know

the stage or the report you know
whatever<00:05:03.349> we<00:05:03.530> decide<00:05:03.979> it'll<00:05:04.820> be<00:05:05.090> pretty<00:05:05.270> sweet

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
whatever we decide it'll be pretty sweet

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.050 
whatever we decide it'll be pretty sweet
and<00:05:05.780> I'm<00:05:05.900> enjoying<00:05:06.199> building<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> stadium<00:05:07.160> as

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
and I'm enjoying building the stadium as

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.390 
and I'm enjoying building the stadium as
you<00:05:08.240> guys<00:05:08.449> can<00:05:08.720> see<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:09.289> don't<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.039> the<00:05:10.190> fact

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
you guys can see I don't like the fact

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.529 
you guys can see I don't like the fact
that<00:05:10.550> our<00:05:10.820> stadium

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
that our stadium

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.749 
that our stadium
I'm<00:05:12.500> guessing<00:05:12.979> this<00:05:13.070> whole<00:05:13.250> stage<00:05:13.460> is<00:05:13.610> gonna

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
I'm guessing this whole stage is gonna

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.339 
I'm guessing this whole stage is gonna
have<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.910> be<00:05:14.000> rebuilt<00:05:14.389> because<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.960> should<00:05:15.199> be

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
have to be rebuilt because it should be

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.529 
have to be rebuilt because it should be
higher<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:16.220> should<00:05:16.849> be<00:05:17.000> on<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.150> one-to-one

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
higher it should be on a one-to-one

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.290 
higher it should be on a one-to-one
level<00:05:18.080> like<00:05:18.259> this<00:05:18.729> not<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.759> big<00:05:19.970> fan<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.180> that

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
level like this not a big fan of that

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.839 
level like this not a big fan of that
but<00:05:20.570> oh<00:05:20.870> I<00:05:21.770> don't<00:05:21.949> want<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.280> guys<00:05:22.430> think<00:05:22.729> of<00:05:22.759> a

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
but oh I don't want you guys think of a

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.420 
but oh I don't want you guys think of a
stadium<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.660> a<00:05:24.080> lot<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.710> progress<00:05:24.949> has<00:05:25.400> been

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
stadium and a lot of progress has been

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.810 
stadium and a lot of progress has been
made

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
made

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.629

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
why I put the glowstone in there these

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.740 
why I put the glowstone in there these
seats<00:05:31.190> would<00:05:31.370> be<00:05:31.400> blacked<00:05:31.760> off<00:05:31.970> but<00:05:32.240> these<00:05:32.449> are

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
seats would be blacked off but these are
