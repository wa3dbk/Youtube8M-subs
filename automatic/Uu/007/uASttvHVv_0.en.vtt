 questions you asked guys and girls and 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.209
 Minecraft cats and dogs are 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.770
 back guys on this map that part 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.170
 2 of the map made a few days ago 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.760
 so then the rubbish here ok that in 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.560
 my questions in each level is in with 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.900
 answers and you just have to choose one 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.730
 I hope you like it and have fun 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.410
 you want to pass this map you only pause 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.630
 the video downloads not and when 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.040
 you'll see the video and give it yes 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.329
 that remember guys that the description 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.950
 they have the download link so that 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.870
 can play it and remember that you can 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.910
 send your map to maps not to gamer 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.070
 well the world as then then they are 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.809
 boys is the second part of the map 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.370
 what I did then more or less like 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.809
 two days then I said or why not so 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.219
 so let's start with this in 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.089
 I do not know how I'm going to be forgiven for 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.519
 that cut 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.079
 so we checkpoint and well then 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.579
 I think the questions will be a little more 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.649
 hardcore so well remember guys 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.379
 answer with me tell me no go no what 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.999
 do so let's start guys or that 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.949
 remember to always leave your like your 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.870
 favorite and everything and good that the gods 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.880
 from minecraft join me let's see 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.070
 over here says which of these objects 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.400
 they need fewer items to build themselves 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 ok we already started with hardcore things 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.360
 it's berries is the one that is a slab guys the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.350
 tractor sticks or chests ok 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.510
 Well, I'm between the tiles or the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.880
 sticks because the sticks if I'm not bad 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.530
 you have to collect logs and then 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 the trunks you have to convert 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.480
 so I think that takes more then 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 guys I think it's the one that NASA was a 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.680
 demon so if it's ok it's not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.510
 can do in the damn meter be it not 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.150
 I know if it refers to the level of minecraft 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.850
 Ivan leader of the pocket edition of mine 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.340
 but I'm going to be guided by the pc 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.660
 so for those guys find a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.180
 a son and or me balance get wood 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.979
 place water plant a tree sleep ok 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.930
 this question so if you put it to me 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.090
 hardcore because I think it's a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.619
 chicken pussy clear that not how to make a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.940
 chicken if there is snow in the chickens there 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.310
 come the chickens of mine are chickens 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.709
 satanic end of hell so fall for 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.200
 here was in slaven two guys 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.180
 we discard this I think that in the middle already 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.050
 Seriously, I think that in the never 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.600
 what you can not do 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.790
 place good water I do not think either 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.240
 you can plant a tree then place 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.860
 water not even pussy 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.350
 because it reminds me a little of 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.420
 diversity for pc boys since then 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.520
 there is a challenge there is one thing that puts you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.120
 ask questions then I think that 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.670
 sleep not perfect 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.090
 Now be the sponge when it is placed 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.140
 and it removes itself earth sound 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.760
 flat sand wood and stone that this one 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.280
 that deserves guys please gods of the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.710
 earth on earth guys here is yes 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.420
 I knew it ok 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.680
 when I know not how stone is generated 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.480
 polish what the hell itching washing over 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.510
 of cobblestone cobblestone generator 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.130
 the water goes on top of the water 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.320
 mouth 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.620
 I think it refers to the stone that does not 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.660
 it can be mined, that is, not having 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.890
 polished stone would be the stone that you 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.720
 you find anywhere in 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.060
 minecraft or you're going watching and you're going 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.860
 finding and when the spades are 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.540
 it converts into covers tone but so that 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.830
 become polished stone you have to 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.240
 cook it then I would not know guys 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.370
 to see lava on top of cold stone 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.950
 cold stone lab generator on top of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.330
 water water over ok ok I'm going to 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:42.980
 go over lava will not let me 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.150
 here locked up I will starve 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.680
 damn it like here what cruelty like that 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.570
 that then a cut boys and I go back 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.460
 when I can leave here with me what 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.750
 cruel then back here guys and 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.970
 Well, over here I had to put a 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.470
 little bit of land to come out that good 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.520
 see the question what was I already forgot 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.210
 say how polished stone is generated the 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.210
 on top of water 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.019
 it would be good says apart from coal there 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.170
 wood materials that are used as 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.180
 fuel which of these items is not 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.859
 use as fuel ok you are and thousands of 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.620
 guys to see if he's around because this one 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.900
 I was in divercity for weight then to 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.840
 see says wooden sword wood 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.550
 processed door trap signal or pallets 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.530
 okay 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.660
 tell me cheat or whatever you want but 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.030
 here is the sign 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.180
 perfect says which of these blocks 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.690
 is generated in the net of the wood ok 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.570
 processed wood gravel stone and earth 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.039
 ok I think this boy is being 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.050
 guiding a lot for what is weigh 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.550
 so then good are questions from 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.500
 minecraft then it can be general 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.000
 guys and well then remember that if then 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.760
 followed here if you want to see our 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.310
 map after then survey can be of 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.699
 minecraft because tennis or minecraft psc or 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.620
 from xbox whatever the important thing is 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.110
 that we learn together ok so then 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.000
 this one sometimes records perfect guys and 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.590

 this is basic if you know it 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.280
 minecraft ero medium experienced as 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.460
 I said the melon feeds very little 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.620
 then that feeds less than melon 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.990
 this potato fuck my god why 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.630
