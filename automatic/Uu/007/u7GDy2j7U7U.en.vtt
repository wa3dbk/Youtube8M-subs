this<00:00:24.020> is<00:00:24.200> traveling<00:00:24.620> into<00:00:25.610> the<00:00:25.700> beaker<00:00:26.380> and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
this is traveling into the beaker and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.670 
this is traveling into the beaker and
bubbling<00:00:27.920> out<00:00:28.040> at<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.220> bottom<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.580> tube

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.410 

alright<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:36.830> been<00:00:36.890> about<00:00:37.240> 25-30<00:00:38.240> minutes

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
alright it's been about 25-30 minutes

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.870 
alright it's been about 25-30 minutes
and<00:00:38.840> we<00:00:39.560> can<00:00:39.710> see<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.130> precipitate<00:00:40.850> of

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
and we can see a precipitate of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.200 
and we can see a precipitate of
potassium<00:00:41.630> iodate<00:00:42.260> floating<00:00:43.040> on<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.280> top<00:00:43.310> of

the<00:00:44.750> liquid<00:00:44.900> and<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:46.400> few<00:00:47.000> crystals<00:00:47.750> on<00:00:48.610> the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
the liquid and a few crystals on the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.300 
the liquid and a few crystals on the
bottom<00:00:50.050> I'd<00:00:51.050> say<00:00:51.290> we're<00:00:51.440> about<00:00:51.470> halfway<00:00:51.920> done

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
bottom I'd say we're about halfway done

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.790 
bottom I'd say we're about halfway done
I'm<00:00:52.520> gonna<00:00:52.670> leave<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:52.910> for<00:00:53.030> an<00:00:53.120> hour<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:59.800> we

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
I'm gonna leave it for an hour and we

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.670 
I'm gonna leave it for an hour and we
are<00:01:00.950> about<00:01:01.250> our<00:01:01.970> about<00:01:02.750> 50<00:01:03.050> minutes<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.530> be

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
are about our about 50 minutes to be

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.000 
are about our about 50 minutes to be
more<00:01:03.890> exact<00:01:04.189> and<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.210> synthesis<00:01:05.800> at<00:01:06.800> this

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
more exact and the synthesis at this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.390 
more exact and the synthesis at this
point<00:01:07.400> we<00:01:08.090> can<00:01:08.240> see<00:01:08.510> pretty<00:01:09.470> dense<00:01:09.950> white

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
point we can see pretty dense white

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.580 
point we can see pretty dense white
precipitate<00:01:10.700> on<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:12.050> bottom<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.440> beaker

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
precipitate on the bottom of the beaker

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.070 
precipitate on the bottom of the beaker
and<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:15.229> have<00:01:15.890> had<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.340> add<00:01:16.750> hydrochloric<00:01:17.750> acid

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
and I have had to add hydrochloric acid

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.469 
and I have had to add hydrochloric acid
again<00:01:18.820> twice<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.360> colon<00:01:20.750> generator<00:01:22.479> but

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
again twice to the colon generator but

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.180 
again twice to the colon generator but
everything<00:01:24.350> seems<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.590> be<00:01:24.650> going<00:01:24.740> well<00:01:24.950> I'll

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
everything seems to be going well I'll

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.719 
everything seems to be going well I'll
stop<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.670> about<00:01:26.680> 10<00:01:27.680> minutes<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:31.640> know

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
stop it in about 10 minutes and you know

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.440 
stop it in about 10 minutes and you know
what's<00:01:31.850> going<00:01:32.000> on<00:01:33.940> alright<00:01:34.940> now<00:01:35.150> it's<00:01:35.299> been

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
what's going on alright now it's been

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.770 
what's going on alright now it's been
about<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.659> good<00:01:35.930> hour<00:01:36.140> I'm<00:01:36.409> about<00:01:36.619> ready<00:01:36.799> to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
about a good hour I'm about ready to

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.530 
about a good hour I'm about ready to
finish<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:39.250> one<00:01:40.270> interesting<00:01:41.270> thing<00:01:41.299> I'd

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
finish here one interesting thing I'd

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.149 
finish here one interesting thing I'd
like<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.810> note<00:01:42.049> is<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.590> started<00:01:42.950> with<00:01:43.100> a

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
like to note is that I started with a

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.859 
like to note is that I started with a
little<00:01:43.640> over<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.000> hundred<00:01:44.210> milliliters<00:01:44.840> of

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
little over a hundred milliliters of

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.859 
little over a hundred milliliters of
water<00:01:45.170> now<00:01:46.130> I'm<00:01:46.369> down<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.760> little<00:01:47.030> under<00:01:47.450> 50

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
water now I'm down to a little under 50

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.010 
water now I'm down to a little under 50
I<00:01:48.490> mean<00:01:49.490> obviously<00:01:49.670> because<00:01:50.330> I've<00:01:50.869> been

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
I mean obviously because I've been

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.910 
I mean obviously because I've been
heating<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.560> lot<00:01:51.770> has<00:01:51.890> been

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
heating it and a lot has been

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.429 
heating it and a lot has been
evaporating<00:01:52.520> away<00:01:53.110> just<00:01:54.110> something

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
evaporating away just something

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.249 
evaporating away just something
interesting<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.310> note<00:01:55.930> there's<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.020> lot<00:01:57.140> of

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
interesting to note there's a lot of

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.510 
interesting to note there's a lot of
precipitate<00:01:57.890> down<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:58.220> now<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:58.790> I<00:02:00.369> think<00:02:01.369> we

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
precipitate down there now so I think we

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.560 
precipitate down there now so I think we
are<00:02:01.640> done<00:02:02.439> I'm<00:02:03.439> going<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.830> be<00:02:04.180> putting<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.360> two

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
are done I'm going to be putting the two

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.149 
are done I'm going to be putting the two
bit<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.960> chlorine<00:02:06.259> generator<00:02:06.560> feeds<00:02:06.890> two

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
bit the chlorine generator feeds two

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.909 
bit the chlorine generator feeds two
into<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.850> solution<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.479> sodium<00:02:09.259> hydroxide<00:02:09.469> I

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.430 
we are finished product the beaker on
the<00:02:32.680> Left<00:02:33.040> contains<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.230> potassium<00:02:35.230> chloride

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the Left contains the potassium chloride

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.010 
the Left contains the potassium chloride
8<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.070> poured<00:02:36.910> off<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.360> solution<00:02:37.780> into<00:02:37.990> the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
8 I poured off the solution into the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.840 
8 I poured off the solution into the
beaker<00:02:38.320> on<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> right<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:39.370> decided<00:02:39.820> that

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
beaker on the right but decided that

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.130 
beaker on the right but decided that
there<00:02:40.090> was<00:02:40.150> enough<00:02:40.390> crystals<00:02:40.750> down<00:02:40.930> there

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
there was enough crystals down there

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.680 
there was enough crystals down there
that<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> would<00:02:41.410> try<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.590> save<00:02:41.890> them<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.360> I'm

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
that I would try to save them so I'm

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.020 
that I would try to save them so I'm
letting<00:02:44.020> both<00:02:44.350> dry<00:02:44.890> out<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.580> then<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:45.850> going

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
letting both dry out and then I'm going

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.620 
letting both dry out and then I'm going
to<00:02:46.120> collect<00:02:46.510> my<00:02:47.290> product
