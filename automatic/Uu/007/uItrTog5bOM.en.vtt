00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
inside like right here like I could just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
inside like right here like I could just
let<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.060> would<00:01:12.150> slide<00:01:12.450> inside<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
let it go and it would slide inside it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
let it go and it would slide inside it
slides<00:01:13.320> perfectly<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> little<00:01:15.420> bit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
slides perfectly in there's a little bit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
slides perfectly in there's a little bit
of<00:01:15.659> space<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.560> between<00:01:16.770> over<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of space in between over here and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
of space in between over here and
there's<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.860> space<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> top<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
there's like space on the top but the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
there's like space on the top but the
space<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> top<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> give<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
space on the top is is to give is use so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
space on the top is is to give is use so
when<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> fill<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.200> would<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.409> up

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
when you fill it up like it would go up

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
when you fill it up like it would go up
and<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.950> could<00:01:29.130> pop<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.150> more

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and this could pop out so you have more

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.319 
and this could pop out so you have more
storage<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.280> storage<00:01:33.180> space

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
storage like you have more storage space

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
storage like you have more storage space
as<00:01:34.159> well<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:36.150> part<00:01:36.450> over<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:37.009> many<00:01:38.009> people

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
are wonder if the zipper is going to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.240 
are wonder if the zipper is going to
scratch<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.909> Mac<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:44.159> have

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
scratch or Mac but if you see they have

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
scratch or Mac but if you see they have
these<00:01:44.430> two<00:01:44.670> flops<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.509> here<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> one

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
these two flops right over here this one

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.399 
these two flops right over here this one
this<00:01:46.320> one<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:47.280> close<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.450> when<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
this one which close like this when you

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.130 
this one which close like this when you
when<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.829> sip<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.780> here<00:01:51.780> you'll<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
when you sip it up so here you'll have a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.190 
when you sip it up so here you'll have a
view<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:52.979> close<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:54.990> up

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
view of how they close you get up up

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
view of how they close you get up up
like<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.610> closing<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:59.210> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
like right there you're closing so this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
like right there you're closing so this
won't<00:02:00.600> scratch<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.259> Mac<00:02:01.549> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.850> final

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
won't scratch your Mac this is the final

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.580 
won't scratch your Mac this is the final
sleeve<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.229> closed<00:02:04.590> down<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.610> doesn't

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
sleeve when it's closed down it doesn't

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
sleeve when it's closed down it doesn't
it's<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.829> too<00:02:08.039> bulky<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.489> anything<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it's not too bulky or anything so it's I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.210 
it's not too bulky or anything so it's I
think<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.140> perfect

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
think it's perfect

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
think it's perfect
it's<00:02:11.340> better<00:02:11.520> than<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> hard<00:02:12.030> hard<00:02:12.540> shells

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's better than the hard hard shells

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.990 
it's better than the hard hard shells
