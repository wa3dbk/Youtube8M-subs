00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.010 
plan into reality well the first thing I
did<00:01:58.859> was<00:01:59.009> write<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.689> that's<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
did was write it down I think that's a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.889 
did was write it down I think that's a
big<00:02:01.619> key<00:02:01.889> in<00:02:02.069> achieving<00:02:02.459> any<00:02:02.939> goal<00:02:03.179> as<00:02:03.419> being

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
big key in achieving any goal as being

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.330 
big key in achieving any goal as being
able<00:02:04.109> to<00:02:04.169> see<00:02:04.349> it<00:02:04.439> their<00:02:04.619> own<00:02:04.649> paper<00:02:05.039> every

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
able to see it their own paper every

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.409 
able to see it their own paper every
night<00:02:05.490> before<00:02:05.609> you<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.880> bed<00:02:05.999> and<00:02:06.389> then

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:06.419 
night before you go to bed and then

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:08.300 
night before you go to bed and then
after<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.139> just<00:02:07.439> hard<00:02:07.619> work<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.130> got<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
after that's just hard work you got to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
after that's just hard work you got to
go<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.240> no<00:02:10.110> matter

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
go out there and get to do it no matter

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
go out there and get to do it no matter
what<00:02:10.380> you're<00:02:10.679> doing<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.880> writing<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.300> book

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
what you're doing if it's writing a book

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.350 
what you're doing if it's writing a book
that's<00:02:13.140> riding<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.770> bike<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.000> playing<00:02:15.270> a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
that's riding a bike if it's playing a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.089 
that's riding a bike if it's playing a
sport<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.900> know<00:02:15.930> you're<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> get

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
sport you know you're not going to get

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.120 
sport you know you're not going to get
any<00:02:17.220> better<00:02:17.250> unless<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.970> go<00:02:18.150> out<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.569> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
any better unless you go out and do it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.410 
any better unless you go out and do it
I<00:02:19.190> think<00:02:19.550> that's<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.790> big<00:02:19.970> thing<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.180> helped

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
I think that's a big thing that helped

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.090 
I think that's a big thing that helped
