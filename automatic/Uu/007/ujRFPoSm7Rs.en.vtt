and I've managed to do it cut down the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
and I've managed to do it cut down the
time<00:00:15.260> first<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.379> all<00:00:16.470> obviously<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.980> need<00:00:17.130> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
we'll draw different things different

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.500 
we'll draw different things different
mouth<00:01:02.129> shapes<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.180> each<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> these<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:05.510> let

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
mouth shapes in each one of these so let

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
mouth shapes in each one of these so let
me<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.750> delete<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.580> one

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
me just delete that one and here is one

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.320 
me just delete that one and here is one
I<00:01:09.060> prepared<00:01:09.479> earlier<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> we've<00:01:12.299> got

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I prepared earlier so what we've got

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.460 
I prepared earlier so what we've got
here<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.960> we've<00:01:13.799> got<00:01:14.210> that's<00:01:15.210> shape<00:01:16.049> one

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
here is we've got that's shape one

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.730 
here is we've got that's shape one
it's<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.799> closed<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:18.020> fully<00:01:19.020> open<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it's just closed and fully open and in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.940 
it's just closed and fully open and in
between<00:01:19.860> them<00:01:20.220> we've<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.390> half<00:01:21.540> open

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
between them we've got just a half open

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.170 
between them we've got just a half open
so<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.240> look<00:01:25.009> just<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.220> nice<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:26.909> loop<00:01:27.150> there

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
so it look just a nice little loop there

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
so it look just a nice little loop there
just<00:01:27.780> makes<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> look<00:01:28.170> nice<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> smooth<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
just makes it look nice and smooth and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
just makes it look nice and smooth and
then<00:01:29.579> we've<00:01:29.729> also<00:01:29.880> got<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.840> guru<00:01:31.560> sound<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
then we've also got a and guru sound and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.069 
then we've also got a and guru sound and
iron<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.520> whoo<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.729> each

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
iron and whoo and then so two for each

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
iron and whoo and then so two for each
animation<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.070> closed<00:01:38.720> now

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
animation and then one for closed now

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
animation and then one for closed now
we've<00:01:39.869> also<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:41.009> three<00:01:41.640> layers<00:01:41.850> here

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we've also got on three layers here

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.170 
we've also got on three layers here
one's<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> face<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
one's the face and I don't know if you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
one's the face and I don't know if you
can<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.689> I've<00:01:45.810> slightly<00:01:46.229> altered

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
can see that but I've slightly altered

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.100 
can see that but I've slightly altered
the<00:01:46.740> chin<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.729> each<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.659> when<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:48.869> talks

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the chin for each one so when he talks

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.359 
the chin for each one so when he talks
his<00:01:49.439> chin<00:01:49.710> moves<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.070> well

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
his chin moves as well

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
his chin moves as well
and<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.329> same<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.689> his<00:01:51.810> mustache<00:01:51.990> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and the same with his mustache that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.139 
and the same with his mustache that
looks<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.130> weird<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.850> fine-tune

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
looks a bit weird but you can fine-tune

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.219 
looks a bit weird but you can fine-tune
it<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:56.939> we've<00:01:57.060> got<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.360> sound<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.200> here

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it so then we've got this sound up here

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.090 
it so then we've got this sound up here
now<00:01:59.159> kids<00:01:59.759> who<00:02:00.329> could<00:02:00.659> tell<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.200> what<00:02:01.409> time<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100

my<00:02:04.680> animations<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:06.990> gonna<00:02:07.079> turn<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
my animations so we're gonna turn this

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219 
my animations so we're gonna turn this
guy<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> single<00:02:08.250> frame<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:09.929> he<00:02:09.989> just

guy on to a single frame so now he just
that's<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.830> frame<00:02:11.069> one

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that's just on frame one

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.740 
that's just on frame one
and<00:02:12.510> now<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.110> go<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.470> each<00:02:15.230> syllable<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.690> okay<00:02:18.690> JH

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750

now kids is two syllables just put it
roughly<00:02:22.500> kind<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.100> middle<00:02:23.250> whatever

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
roughly kind of in the middle whatever

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:44.150 
roughly kind of in the middle whatever
now<00:02:24.270> kids<00:02:25.550> good<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:28.560> tell<00:02:35.000> what<00:02:43.160> so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
already tell it's Dyson ghetto kids who

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.340 
already tell it's Dyson ghetto kids who
couldn't<00:02:47.160> tell<00:02:47.459> me<00:02:47.640> what<00:02:47.880> time<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.570> just

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
couldn't tell me what time it is just

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.800 
couldn't tell me what time it is just
real<00:02:49.560> rough<00:02:49.770> now<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.820> working<00:02:51.000> on<00:02:51.150> 25<00:02:51.540> frames

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
real rough now I'm working on 25 frames

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.180 
real rough now I'm working on 25 frames
per<00:02:51.989> second<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.500> video<00:02:52.769> probably<00:02:52.920> won't

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
per second so this video probably won't

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.199 
per second so this video probably won't
catch<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.550> perfectly

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
catch it perfectly

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.040 
catch it perfectly
yeah<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:56.100> basically<00:02:56.580> all<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.390> that's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
yeah but basically all you do is that's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.320 
yeah but basically all you do is that's
fine<00:02:58.260> double<00:02:58.950> our<00:02:59.130> shape<00:02:59.900> kids<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.470> example

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.630 

now<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.360> need<00:03:06.660> four<00:03:07.380> keyframes<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.010> row<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
now we need four keyframes in a row the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.970 
now we need four keyframes in a row the
last<00:03:08.850> one<00:03:09.060> obviously<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.140> start<00:03:10.440> off<00:03:10.590> with

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
last one obviously if you start off with

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
last one obviously if you start off with
just<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.519> closed<00:03:11.730> mouth<00:03:13.010> almost<00:03:14.010> open<00:03:14.370> open

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
just a closed mouth almost open open

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.180 
just a closed mouth almost open open
almost<00:03:15.360> open<00:03:16.050> closed<00:03:16.500> that's<00:03:16.980> how<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
almost open closed that's how the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.220 
almost open closed that's how the
animation<00:03:17.640> goes<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.690> quickly<00:03:18.930> block

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
animation goes so we just quickly block

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.270 
animation goes so we just quickly block
that<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.829> number<00:03:20.130> three<00:03:22.220> number<00:03:23.220> two

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
that in so number three number two

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.530 
that in so number three number two
number<00:03:26.280> two<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:26.880> need<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.120> click<00:03:27.299> on<00:03:27.329> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
number two now you need to click on the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.509 
number two now you need to click on the
symbol<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.709> get<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.160> thing<00:03:29.400> down

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
symbol so you get this little thing down

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.250 
symbol so you get this little thing down
here<00:03:33.680> no<00:03:34.680> kids

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.640 
you copy the frame the actual frames
here<00:04:20.039> by<00:04:20.220> right-clicking<00:04:20.640> going<00:04:20.970> copy<00:04:21.180> frames

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
here by right-clicking going copy frames

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.670 
here by right-clicking going copy frames
no<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.890> move<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.190> back<00:04:23.370> over<00:04:23.610> here

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
all you do now is just go to all of your

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
all you do now is just go to all of your
other<00:04:28.419> syllables<00:04:31.139> obviously<00:04:32.139> not<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.410> sounds

there's a can so we just select one on

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.170 
there's a can so we just select one on
either<00:04:37.300> side<00:04:37.449> of<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.380> syllable<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.180> paste

either side of the syllable and paste
and<00:04:40.479> that<00:04:40.509> automatically<00:04:41.080> puts<00:04:41.410> in<00:04:41.500> their

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
and that automatically puts in their

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:53.340 
and that automatically puts in their
closed<00:04:42.039> afterwards<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:52.389> must<00:04:52.509> it<00:04:52.720> go<00:04:53.139> through

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
closed afterwards you must it go through

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.820 
closed afterwards you must it go through
and<00:04:53.530> block<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.919> in<00:04:55.080> now<00:04:56.080> we'll<00:04:56.289> go<00:04:56.410> back<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.620> do

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
and block it in now we'll go back and do

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.710 
and block it in now we'll go back and do
that<00:04:56.979> now<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.430> just<00:04:57.669> you'd<00:04:58.210> obviously<00:04:58.360> go

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
that now you just you'd obviously go

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.810 
that now you just you'd obviously go
through<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.050> polish<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.680> all<00:04:59.830> up<00:04:59.979> I'm<00:05:00.729> just

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
through and polish that all up I'm just
