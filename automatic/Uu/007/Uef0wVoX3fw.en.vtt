00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
haven't changed that much over time and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.200 
haven't changed that much over time and
a<00:01:18.140> lot<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.590> way<00:01:18.740> they<00:01:18.979> are<00:01:19.039> made<00:01:19.369> today<00:01:19.670> is

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
a lot of the way they are made today is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.179 
a lot of the way they are made today is
the<00:01:20.659> same<00:01:20.990> 100<00:01:21.920> years<00:01:22.130> ago<00:01:23.979> some<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.070> the

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
the same 100 years ago some of the

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.359 
the same 100 years ago some of the
tissues<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.729> we<00:01:25.850> wear<00:01:26.119> or<00:01:26.689> 30<00:01:27.500> years<00:01:27.799> old<00:01:28.039> at

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
tissues that we wear or 30 years old at

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:28.840 
tissues that we wear or 30 years old at
least

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
least

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.109 
least
so<00:01:29.689> you've<00:01:29.840> got<00:01:30.049> 30<00:01:30.350> years<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.890> wear<00:01:31.310> 30<00:01:31.880> years

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
so you've got 30 years of wear 30 years

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:43.529 
so you've got 30 years of wear 30 years
of<00:01:32.240> sweat<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:33.289> different<00:01:33.770> dancers

do feel elegant when you wear a tutu so

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.330 
do feel elegant when you wear a tutu so
it<00:01:59.590> naturally<00:02:00.190> reflects<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:01.090> your<00:02:01.240> dancing

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it naturally reflects in your dancing

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.620 
it naturally reflects in your dancing
you<00:02:03.340> put<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.580> two<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.909> one<00:02:03.940> you<00:02:04.119> feel<00:02:04.360> like<00:02:04.600> a

hours to make if they're decorated there
will<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.280> at<00:02:15.610> least<00:02:15.790> another<00:02:16.000> 15<00:02:16.600> hours<00:02:17.519> when

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
will be at least another 15 hours when

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.520 
will be at least another 15 hours when
you<00:02:18.610> think<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.209> tutus<00:02:19.870> are<00:02:20.019> quite

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
you think about it tutus are quite

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.050 
you think about it tutus are quite
strange<00:02:21.989> but<00:02:22.989> for<00:02:23.260> us<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:24.220> really<00:02:24.250> does<00:02:24.670> become

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
strange but for us it really does become

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.020 
strange but for us it really does become
second<00:02:25.840> nature<00:02:26.070> they<00:02:27.070> sort<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.370> soften<00:02:27.820> with

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
second nature they sort of soften with

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.800 
second nature they sort of soften with
sweat<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:28.989> movement<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.060> mold<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.510> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
sweat and movement and mold to you and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:48.490 
sweat and movement and mold to you and
they<00:02:32.410> start<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.860> feel<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.910> part<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.300> you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.930 

there's<00:02:49.500> something<00:02:49.770> useful<00:02:50.160> about<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.520> way<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
there's something useful about the way a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.580 
there's something useful about the way a
tutu<00:02:51.360> adds<00:02:51.540> another<00:02:51.810> dimension<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
tutu adds another dimension to the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.250 
tutu adds another dimension to the
dancer<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> tilts<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.630> moves<00:02:54.870> without

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
dancer as it tilts and moves without

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.620 
dancer as it tilts and moves without
covering<00:02:56.010> any<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> technique<00:02:59.480> the<00:03:00.480> one

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
covering any of the technique the one

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.390 
covering any of the technique the one
thing<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.349> challenging<00:03:01.950> about<00:03:02.040> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
thing that can be challenging about a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.570 
thing that can be challenging about a
tutti<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.209> can't<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.660> anybody's<00:03:04.230> feet<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.520> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
tutti you can't see anybody's feet but I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.770 
tutti you can't see anybody's feet but I
think<00:03:05.790> two<00:03:06.060> T's<00:03:06.209> are<00:03:06.300> probably<00:03:06.600> more

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
think two T's are probably more
