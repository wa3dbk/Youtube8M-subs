00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.450
 coconut horchata we will use to 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.419
 this coco horchata we are going to put 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.449
 I have the coconut here as you can see the 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.970
 coconut has this little shell this 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.519
 We are going to remove yellow shell 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.189
 with the knife very well and will be 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.189
 so all white is the only thing we're going to 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.039
 make clean the coconut very well let's 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.290
 grate it also remember to always wash 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.780
 very good the coconut after what is 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.270
 you got the pulp, well, the pulp 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.070
 the lava one very well we are going to grate it and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.740
 let's remove all that little shell 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.050
 yellow and we will also reserve it 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.810
 let's use a cup of rice 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.090
 white here I have white rice no 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.630
 is washed as soon as we wash it very 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.300
 well in a strainer we will use 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.850
 a can of evaporated milk we're going to 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.640
 use a twig only of cinnamon 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.640
 a few drops of vanilla a little 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.030
 walnut walnut this is just to give it 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.460
 like a touch of flavor much better to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.430
 this delicious horchata and we are going to 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.340
 use white sugar the necessary 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.030
 let's also use water the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.580
 necessary and let's start first 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.580
 what we are going to do is clean the coconut and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.860
 We will wash the rice very well and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 then I'm going to show you the step by step 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.770
 of this delicious preparation of 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.770
 coconut horchata 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.890
 let's take this whole house very well 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.409
 right now that I tell you because it's 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.750
 Cascarita, well, it's not going to give you 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.759
 that a very nice taste storchak 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 that's why you have to clean the coconut very well 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.330
 and another thing of preference if the coconut does not 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.940
 It's very tough it's much better because 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.610
 Well, it tastes better, it 's water 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.420
 horchata if you can see then the coconut does not 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.759
 This seasoning is very dry but it is not 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.580
 very dry and that's what 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.769
 It gives a little more flavor we are going to peel 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.060
 very well all the coconut we are going to peel 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.360
 so it has 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.060
 all the coconut well cleaned and then what 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.450
 let's wash it well so that it falls out 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.270
 all the excess cascarita and what 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.590
 we clean very well and then we go to 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.610
 follow 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.110
 cleaning all the rest 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.320
 to show them how it has to be 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.350
 and here I have a boiling water is 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.100
 about a liter of water where 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.440
 I'm going to put cooking rice and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.200
 cinnamon and rice and cinnamon already knows 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.690
 very well right now and then we're going to 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.690
 put 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.450
 and we're going to leave it there is the pot 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.830
 we'll wait for it to break the 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.410
 boil turn off the heat and let 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.410
 the rice softens and then we 're going 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.010
 to take liquefy with the coconut we are going to 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.010
 leave it there is about 10 minutes nothing 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.850
 more than rice soften and then 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.770
 this 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.860
 we hope it boils we remove the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.860
 fire and we leave it there and we will continue 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.790
 Well I here is rice and it is 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.799
 softening and I added more than half 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.709
 Coconut will use for 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.560
 horchata for the coconut to soften and 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.049
 not left with much gabazo but that is 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.319
 soft to liquefy we are going to leave it 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.689
 there this 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.969
 and we're going to leave it there for a while like this 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.799
 the hot water so that it softens 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.909
 well and then we will take it to 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.909
 liquefy everything together 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.420
 and the rice is already soft but it is not 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.460
 blender so we will take it to liquefy 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.460
 and the coconut also softened a bit 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.100
 We are going to liquefy in two parts so that 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.459
 we are going to irrigate what we are going to 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.459
 liquefy 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.210
 you have to let it liquefy very very 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.000
 good for that coconut and good rice 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.720
 well they are well blended now we are going 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.720
 to strain 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.760
 to strain very well 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.900
 right now it's a bit hot because 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.510
 we cooked some rice but now 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.900
 after 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.180
 all right 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.090
 let's go with that part and we're going to 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.520
 liquefy now the other part that was left in 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.520
 the pot because we do not liquefy everything together 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.370
 and we will continue 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.039
 in this second liquefied we are going to 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.889
 add the other coconut that we had left 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.830
 they have alarte 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.520
 we will put we will take the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.520
 and with another turn 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.020
 Well, here we have everything very well 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.780
 strained now by this side we're going to 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.169
 put to liquefy sugar vanilla 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.780
 milk and we're going to put some nuts and 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.970
 I also put a handful of almonds and 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.729
 this is not going to strain if you do not 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.500
 like nuts and almond balls 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.860
 in the water, well, you can strain it 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.460
 we are going to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.710
 does not have a blender 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.259
 and we're going to put the vanilla milk 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.210
 they are just droplets to give 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.760
 Water taste is not much vanilla 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.400
 what are we going to use 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.790
 now we are going to put only some 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.480
 vanilla droplets and we will take it 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.480
 to liquefy 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.480
 your mind 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.910
 Well, I already have this here 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.950
 horchata finished what I'm going to what 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.530
 I did is add a little more water 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.170
 so that it is thick but not so thick 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.260
 but if I feel that you need a 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.660
 little bit of evaporated milk then 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.120
 let's put we are not going to put a 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.870
 can but we're going to put a can 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.320
 and a half of evaporated milk so that 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.680
 come out of a much better flavor and right now 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.910
 I will show them and the presentation 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.000
 finished for you to see how 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.450
 Horchata water is delicious 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.660
