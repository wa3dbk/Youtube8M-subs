none<00:01:44.459> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.639> pain<00:01:44.850> goes<00:01:45.090> under<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.509> stencil

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
none of the pain goes under the stencil

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.779 
none of the pain goes under the stencil
because<00:01:46.319> then<00:01:46.709> it<00:01:46.920> won't<00:01:47.100> follow<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> shape

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
because then it won't follow the shape

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.480 
because then it won't follow the shape
it<00:01:48.029> will<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.329> become<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:48.959> big<00:01:49.229> blob<00:01:49.679> and<00:01:49.979> after

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it will just become a big blob and after

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429 
it will just become a big blob and after
you've<00:01:50.609> covered<00:01:50.789> everything<00:01:51.179> equally<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you've covered everything equally that

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.019 
you've covered everything equally that
you're<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.859> peel<00:01:53.279> off<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.459> stencil

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.029 
you're going to peel off the stencil

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.999 
you're going to peel off the stencil
hopefully<00:01:54.569> before<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:54.929> paint<00:01:55.229> dries<00:01:55.529> because

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
hopefully before the paint dries because

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.589 
hopefully before the paint dries because
it's<00:01:56.249> a<00:01:56.369> paint<00:01:56.579> dry<00:01:56.789> as<00:01:56.850> well<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.179> stencil<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
it's a paint dry as well the stencil is

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's a paint dry as well the stencil is
still<00:01:57.779> on<00:01:57.959> it<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.229> stencil<00:01:58.679> might<00:01:58.799> actually

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
still on it the stencil might actually

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.739 
still on it the stencil might actually
rip<00:01:59.429> off<00:01:59.579> some<00:01:59.789> of<00:01:59.849> the<00:01:59.969> paint<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.389> mess<00:02:00.599> up

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
rip off some of the paint and mess up

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.599 
rip off some of the paint and mess up
your<00:02:00.899> design<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.950> ok<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.459> not

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
your design but that's ok if it's not

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.249 
your design but that's ok if it's not
perfect<00:02:02.639> it's<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.539> looked<00:02:03.959> at<00:02:04.109> from

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
perfect it's going to be looked at from

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.230 
perfect it's going to be looked at from
far<00:02:04.590> away<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> real<00:02:05.549> tattoo<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.179> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
far away it's not a real tattoo so you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.449 
far away it's not a real tattoo so you
don't<00:02:06.389> have<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.599> worry<00:02:06.779> about<00:02:06.929> details<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.709> if

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
don't have to worry about details and if

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.040 
don't have to worry about details and if
you<00:02:08.580> really<00:02:08.759> mess<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.390> actually<00:02:09.720> easy<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you really mess up it's actually easy to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.720 
you really mess up it's actually easy to
take<00:02:10.229> off<00:02:10.380> all<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.310> rub<00:02:11.610> it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
take off all you have to do is rub it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.309 
take off all you have to do is rub it
which<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.180> good<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.390> bad<00:02:12.540> because<00:02:13.020> if<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
which is good and bad because if you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.250 
which is good and bad because if you
accidentally<00:02:14.040> rub<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.520> may<00:02:14.790> crack<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.569> but

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
accidentally rub it you may crack it but

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.080 
accidentally rub it you may crack it but
if<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.740> want<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.130> take<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.310> off<00:02:17.520> all<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.940> have

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
if you want to take it off all you have

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.699 
if you want to take it off all you have
to<00:02:18.209> do<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.450> rub<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.140> depends<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
to do is rub it so it depends on how you

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.530 
to do is rub it so it depends on how you
look<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.819> just<00:02:21.060> take<00:02:21.209> care<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.420> your

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
look at it so just take care of your

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.660 
look at it so just take care of your
tattoo<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.560> should<00:02:22.739> last<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.129> day<00:02:23.189> mine

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
tattoo and it should last all day mine

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.490 
tattoo and it should last all day mine
certainly<00:02:24.030> did<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.480> wasn't<00:02:24.810> until<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.349> day

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
certainly did it wasn't until the day

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.850 
certainly did it wasn't until the day
after<00:02:25.650> after<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.610> already<00:02:26.939> slept<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.420> where

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
after after I already slept on it where

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860 
after after I already slept on it where
are<00:02:27.890> my<00:02:28.040> tattoos<00:02:28.460> began<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.940> crack<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.450> then<00:02:29.840> I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
are my tattoos began to crack and then I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.600 
are my tattoos began to crack and then I
decided<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.680> didn't<00:02:30.860> want<00:02:30.950> anymore<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.580> I

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
decided that I didn't want anymore so I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.890 
decided that I didn't want anymore so I
just<00:02:31.790> took<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.970> shower<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.390> they<00:02:32.690> came<00:02:32.870> right

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
just took a shower and they came right

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.470 
just took a shower and they came right
off<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.650> really<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.070> technique<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.700> good<00:02:35.060> for

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
off so really this technique is good for

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.260 
off so really this technique is good for
just<00:02:36.110> one<00:02:36.470> day<00:02:36.500> tattoos<00:02:37.250> which<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.090> still

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
just one day tattoos which is still

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.030 
just one day tattoos which is still
pretty<00:02:38.510> good<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.380> paint<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.770> cheap

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
pretty good because the paint is cheap

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.190 
pretty good because the paint is cheap
it<00:02:40.340> doesn't<00:02:40.640> take<00:02:40.850> too<00:02:40.880> long<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.240> do<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.960> it

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
it doesn't take too long to do it and it

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.510 
it doesn't take too long to do it and it
lasts<00:02:42.530> as<00:02:42.620> long<00:02:42.650> as<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.010> don't<00:02:43.190> rub<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.310> off

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
lasts as long as you don't rub it off

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520 
lasts as long as you don't rub it off
and<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.360> cracks<00:02:44.630> all<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.020> have<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.230> do<00:02:45.380> is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
and if it cracks all you have to do is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.320 
and if it cracks all you have to do is
retrace<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:46.070> which<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.400> again<00:02:46.700> pretty<00:02:47.120> quick

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
retrace it which is again pretty quick

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.750 
retrace it which is again pretty quick
