for<00:06:24.340> me<00:06:24.430> anyway<00:06:24.789> so<00:06:24.849> it<00:06:25.120> doesn't<00:06:25.150> make<00:06:25.419> sense

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
for me anyway so it doesn't make sense

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.230 
for me anyway so it doesn't make sense
personally<00:06:26.770> I<00:06:27.430> think<00:06:27.729> it<00:06:27.940> would<00:06:28.030> have<00:06:28.060> been<00:06:28.180> a

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
personally I think it would have been a

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.459 
personally I think it would have been a
good<00:06:28.389> fight<00:06:28.570> with<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.780> mirror<00:06:29.080> and<00:06:29.199> Timothy

from<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.400> flip<00:06:45.670> side<00:06:46.890> something<00:06:47.890> that<00:06:48.190> he

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
from the flip side something that he

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
said which really stuck out to me was a

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.630 
said which really stuck out to me was a

that perhaps and I don't know if this
would<00:07:03.010> be<00:07:03.070> for<00:07:03.310> sure<00:07:03.490> but<00:07:03.640> maybe<00:07:03.850> if<00:07:04.060> I<00:07:04.150> me<00:07:04.300> a

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
would be for sure but maybe if I me a

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.850 
would be for sure but maybe if I me a
con<00:07:04.630> fights<00:07:06.540> Timothy<00:07:07.540> Bradley<00:07:07.720> it<00:07:08.350> could
