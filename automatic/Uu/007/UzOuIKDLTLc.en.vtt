you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.740> good<00:01:41.070> Geno<00:01:42.030> Smith<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> not

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you know really good Geno Smith and not

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
you know really good Geno Smith and not
too<00:01:42.990> many<00:01:43.140> bad<00:01:43.320> today<00:01:43.560> Geno<00:01:44.070> Smith<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.549> saw<00:01:44.700> him

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
too many bad today Geno Smith I saw him

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.100 
too many bad today Geno Smith I saw him
pull<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> ball<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> couple<00:01:45.659> times<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pull the ball down a couple times and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.929 
pull the ball down a couple times and
run<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.799> thought<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> touchdown

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
run I thought would be for a touchdown

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.539 
run I thought would be for a touchdown
because<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.540> definitely<00:01:49.049> got<00:01:49.290> through<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:50.399> he

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
because he definitely got through if he

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
because he definitely got through if he
does<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> he's<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.390> athletic<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.079> think

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
does that he's so athletic I don't think

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.399 
does that he's so athletic I don't think
he<00:01:52.350> trusts<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.240> athleticism<00:01:54.240> enough<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.350> if

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
he trusts that athleticism enough but if

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
he trusts that athleticism enough but if
he<00:01:55.470> could<00:01:55.619> pull<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> ball<00:01:56.040> down<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.430> run<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
he could pull the ball down and run and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.609 
he could pull the ball down and run and
not<00:01:56.850> make<00:01:57.149> bad<00:01:57.329> place<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.810> saw<00:01:58.170> him<00:01:58.290> eat<00:01:58.439> two
