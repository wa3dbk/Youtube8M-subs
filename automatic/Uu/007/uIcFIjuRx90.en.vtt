00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.830 
today's game I think that we didn't play
well<00:00:06.750> like<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> last<00:00:07.560> month<00:00:08.030> we<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.630> worked

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
too long and too long as a team we

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.499 
too long and too long as a team we
really<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:13.620> lot<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.980> space<00:00:14.250> for<00:00:14.519> them<00:00:14.790> we

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
really a lot of space for them we

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.720 
really a lot of space for them we
considered<00:00:15.990> loss<00:00:17.359> every<00:00:18.359> pay<00:00:18.869> attetion<00:00:19.140> maybe

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
considered loss every pay attetion maybe

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.700 
considered loss every pay attetion maybe
we<00:00:20.730> couldn't<00:00:21.029> consider<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> think

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
we couldn't consider what do you think

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.509 
we couldn't consider what do you think

you<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.090> play<00:00:27.269> well<00:00:27.830> we<00:00:28.830> didn't<00:00:29.099> play<00:00:29.279> well

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
you don't play well we didn't play well

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.990 
you don't play well we didn't play well
and<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.939> scored<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.330> goals<00:00:30.359> okay<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:32.000> we

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and we scored two goals okay but we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.900 
and we scored two goals okay but we
leave<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> space<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.910> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
leave it to space for them this is this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.490 
leave it to space for them this is this
not<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.540> Liverpool's<00:00:37.140> good<00:00:37.320> team

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
not good because Liverpool's good team

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.840 
not good because Liverpool's good team
they<00:00:37.710> play<00:00:37.920> well<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.190> sometimes

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
they play well but you know sometimes

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
they play well but you know sometimes
can<00:00:42.329> happily<00:00:42.600> play<00:00:42.840> three<00:00:43.050> games<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.559> week

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
can happily play three games in one week

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
can happily play three games in one week
probably<00:00:44.270> as<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> say<00:00:45.600> Liverpool<00:00:46.050> certainly

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
probably as you say Liverpool certainly

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.709 
probably as you say Liverpool certainly
didn't<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.129> easy<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.550> there<00:00:47.670> today<00:00:49.250> I

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
didn't make it easy out there today I

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.209 
didn't make it easy out there today I
think<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.289> playing<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.890> leave<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
think that really playing is leave a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.939 
think that really playing is leave a
producer<00:00:53.579> play<00:00:53.850> when<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.960> can't<00:00:55.199> consider<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
producer play when you can't consider a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.450 
producer play when you can't consider a
lot<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.280> space<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.789> conceded<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.460> some

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
lot of space like we conceded and some

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.380 
lot of space like we conceded and some
time<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.059> dep<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.800> play

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
time to dep not so that we we don't play

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
time to dep not so that we we don't play
well<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:04.339> like<00:01:05.339> usually<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.030> play<00:01:06.619> but<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
well like like usually we play but this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.870 
well like like usually we play but this
is<00:01:09.049> ed<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> ground<00:01:11.280> when

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
is ed in was on the ground when

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
is ed in was on the ground when
Liverpool<00:01:12.330> scored<00:01:12.630> their<00:01:12.869> first<00:01:12.900> goal<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
Liverpool scored their first goal do you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
Liverpool scored their first goal do you
think<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> players<00:01:14.159> should<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.610> made<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
think the players should have made it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
think the players should have made it
out<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> play<00:01:15.930> probably<00:01:16.860> only<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:18.380> think<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
out of play probably only I think so but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
out of play probably only I think so but
before<00:01:20.820> these<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> fault

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
before these I think that was a fault

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.429 
before these I think that was a fault
probably<00:01:23.670> yellow<00:01:24.119> card<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.350> know

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
probably yellow card but I don't know

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.490 
probably yellow card but I don't know
why<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> referee<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.460> linemen<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
why the referee and linemen that so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
why the referee and linemen that so
everything<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.189> 10<00:01:29.369> minutes<00:01:29.579> all<00:01:30.060> default

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
everything for 10 minutes all default

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.859 
everything for 10 minutes all default
for<00:01:30.720> Liverpool<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.180> movies<00:01:33.180> flag<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
for Liverpool is so movies flag for the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.300 
for Liverpool is so movies flag for the
referee<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.759> didn't<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:37.310> some

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
referee and there they didn't see some

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.440 
referee and there they didn't see some
time

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
time

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260 
time
and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.500> understand<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.670> decision

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and I don't understand this decision

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.690 
and I don't understand this decision
because<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.860> was<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> penalty<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.579> us

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
because there was a penalty for us

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
because there was a penalty for us
against<00:01:44.969> QPR<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:46.020> dependent<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.070> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
against QPR the dependent there if I

against QPR the dependent there if I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
didn't didn't take today was a fault

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.230 
didn't didn't take today was a fault
after<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.719> score<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> goal<00:01:52.909> usually<00:01:53.909> when

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
after they score a goal usually when

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.340 
after they score a goal usually when
this<00:01:54.570> happen<00:01:55.670> against<00:01:56.670> us<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.569> radical<00:01:57.929> for

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this happen against us is a radical for

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
this happen against us is a radical for

winner for normal for nothing we did

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.809 
winner for normal for nothing we did
fight<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.810> Roberto<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.890> from

fight back the Roberto and would go from

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.160 
fight back the Roberto and would go from
sergio<00:02:06.210> sergio<00:02:07.200> scoring<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.799> fantastical<00:02:09.170> I'm

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sergio sergio scoring a fantastical I'm

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.740 
sergio sergio scoring a fantastical I'm
happy<00:02:10.470> bet<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.310> Our<00:02:11.549> Stars<00:02:11.910> core<00:02:12.150> laws

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
happy bet that the Our Stars core laws

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.380 
happy bet that the Our Stars core laws
but<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.099> should<00:02:14.130> play<00:02:14.459> better

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
but I think that they should play better

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.680 
but I think that they should play better
because<00:02:16.200> also<00:02:17.010> when<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.459> defend<00:02:17.819> we<00:02:18.000> need<00:02:18.120> that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
because also when we defend we need that
