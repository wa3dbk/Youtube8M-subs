00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.690 
there are four different colors largely
there's<00:00:09.000> three<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.900> black<00:00:10.530> now<00:00:11.370> these

there's three and one black now these

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.850 
there's three and one black now these
are<00:00:11.910> very<00:00:12.059> similar<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.080> Maybelline

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
are very similar to the Maybelline

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
are very similar to the Maybelline
colored<00:00:14.400> mascara<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.389> believe<00:00:15.599> color

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
colored mascara and I believe color

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
colored mascara and I believe color
mascara<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.320> finally<00:00:16.710> getting<00:00:16.830> big<00:00:17.160> because<00:00:17.550> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
mascara is finally getting big because I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
mascara is finally getting big because I
think<00:00:17.760> every<00:00:18.150> drugstore<00:00:18.359> brand<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> now<00:00:19.109> going

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
think every drugstore brand is now going

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
think every drugstore brand is now going
to<00:00:19.380> start<00:00:19.619> doing<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.980> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.640> really

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to start doing them which is a really

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.429 
to start doing them which is a really
good<00:00:21.180> thing<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.869> think<00:00:21.990> people<00:00:22.289> should

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
good thing because I think people should

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.380 
good thing because I think people should
start<00:00:22.830> branching<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.090> colored

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
start branching out to the colored

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.509 
start branching out to the colored
mascara<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.439> there's<00:00:26.039> nothing<00:00:26.189> wrong

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
mascara because there's nothing wrong

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.089 
mascara because there's nothing wrong
with<00:00:26.580> adding<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.150> pop<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.599> your<00:00:27.630> life

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
with adding a little pop to your life

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.560 
with adding a little pop to your life

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a colored product made me very happy but

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
a colored product made me very happy but
the<00:01:43.350> formula<00:01:43.770> itself<00:01:44.310> while<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.119> are<00:01:45.299> bright

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the formula itself while they are bright
