00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
do so for them it's like if it only runs

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.469 
do so for them it's like if it only runs
Windows<00:01:23.640> Phone<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> shouldn't<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Windows Phone it shouldn't be that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
Windows Phone it shouldn't be that
important<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.200> runs<00:01:25.350> both<00:01:25.590> things

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
important but if it runs both things

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.789 
important but if it runs both things
it'll<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.400> an<00:01:26.490> immediate<00:01:26.700> sell<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.619> they<00:01:28.619> got<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it'll be an immediate sell so they got a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
it'll be an immediate sell so they got a
good<00:01:28.979> point<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.729> let's<00:01:29.880> talk<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.000> Samsung

is not necessarily for the filters but

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.780 
is not necessarily for the filters but
because<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.770> could<00:03:31.950> actually<00:03:32.100> take<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.520> photo
