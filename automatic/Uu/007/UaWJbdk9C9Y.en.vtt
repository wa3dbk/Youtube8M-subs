00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.790
 so we continue to open a new level 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:19.910
 static less with 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.910
 I understand static mesh objects 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.609
 articles 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.710
 as made in some program from 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.670
 ported 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:40.170
 like fbx file then 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 w mobility play 7 lite god thy then 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.690
 konchalovskim inches tm playing 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:58.649
 this is a static clan secret object 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:01.820
 think russian move and playing why 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.800
 static objects cannot move 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:11.159
 lighting shadows of a moving object 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.899
 there may be dynamic lighting or 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:26.990
 dynamic lighting is installed here 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:32.200
 most likely to parameters away my pink so 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 call me pink went no i don't know light map 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 visas go ahead 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:51.610
 goats there are three volley auto generator shanu 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:57.270
 bulb tires cheese material 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.270
 mens so this is not clear what is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.070
 colleagues on the interaction so without immo 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.690
 action ext simply fight nafta college 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.360
 This ninja generates a static inter lender 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.290
 some simple sex interaction top 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.420
 two intifada 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.430
 auto comics then this Windows generation 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.220
 strikes mishe dna machine mode complex 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.260
 simple 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 so okay we go further light on the prosthesis 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.790
 red rocket 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:53.040
 sockets so this is not clear vertex 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:59.580
 colors color curtain tops 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:05.340
 here the vertex light is set between the pint 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:10.600
 twist out some tool too 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.010
 tinting bear entu textures the same 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:24.570
 tool but with texture level of 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:33.840
 detail level of detail is so clear 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:33.840
 open further will mts so fail 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:48.549
 what are special objects that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:53.349
 may allow blocking a character and 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.349
 these objects they are allowed invisible 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:06.379
 particulars here that we have switch mode to 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.599
 place shift van drag'n'drop and do not cook 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:13.609
 background we fill foot foot plunger wall of 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.620
 johnny 31 not to edit valium understandable 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:19.039
 proposes to put here some 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:24.020
 Cook object and although here it is already here 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:26.750
 worth that and i can't go ahead of me 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.680
 blocks to lower my object which 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.520
 blocks here is set invisible 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.639
 Kalyazin 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:41.139
 here, in essence, the same trip costs gender 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:45.830
 distance will impress jade distance axis 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.410
 Cooling happy with the light of the families of Carl set of 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:56.960
 cool distances depending on the site for 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:02.570
 Jack see that they appear as 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:06.669
 only I approach distance review or 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:11.860
 how to call the distance of visibility of the object 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.860
 light we have athens in pain 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:23.680
 click 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:26.460
 I was leaving and dumping the lighting samples still 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.460
 ran away 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:38.949
 alengo 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:40.120
 son kush fill up with the place by play tingle 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.409
 snot was 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.780
 eri &amp; rice &amp; dub slide loved the times he 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.289
 is generated direct light samples according to 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.289
 coccyx 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:05.100
 so so now we turn it off here 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:14.690
 cashbox 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:14.690
 is the graphics settings and so on 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.310
 so when the computer visibility volem 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:37.220
 here now 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:39.580
 as an activity of visibility 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.580
 vector 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.850
 reception with his will my scheme 0 is 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.670
 visibility and generates auto cut off 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:59.030
 of complash visibility brew is not 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:02.450
 want so clear further your physicist 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:05.610
 vector z simulate physicist correct 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:09.210
 so ok offering all this skipnut then 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:14.010
 have skip anyway it's us about 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:20.550
 what does not say so last haze 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:21.990
 what's virtual reality here we just 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:31.430
 statues curtains all 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:31.430
 with textures applied so clear
