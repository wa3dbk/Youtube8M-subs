in<00:02:15.810> hand<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:17.160> under<00:02:17.490> saddle<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.260> start

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
in hand we get under saddle and start

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.809 
in hand we get under saddle and start
off<00:02:19.440> with<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> person<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> ground<00:02:20.490> so

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
off with the person on the ground so

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.520 
off with the person on the ground so
they<00:02:20.940> understand<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:21.960> move<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.350> to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
they understand and then we move on to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.010 
they understand and then we move on to
doing<00:02:22.860> P<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.310> passage<00:02:23.720> from<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> aides

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
doing P off and passage from the aides

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.440 
doing P off and passage from the aides
and<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.920> rider<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.640> right<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:27.000> he's<00:02:27.180> kind

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and of the rider so right now he's kind

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
and of the rider so right now he's kind
of<00:02:27.510> still<00:02:27.810> figuring<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.710> out<00:02:28.860> he's<00:02:29.100> only<00:02:29.280> six

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
of still figuring it out he's only six

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
of still figuring it out he's only six
so<00:02:30.600> we'll<00:02:30.780> start<00:02:30.990> off<00:02:31.170> with<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.470> little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:31.860> of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
so we'll start off with a little bit of

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.980 
so we'll start off with a little bit of
trot<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.580> him<00:02:32.670> relaxed

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.820 

he<00:02:36.990> likes<00:02:37.170> Alfredo

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.340 

when<00:02:43.830> we're<00:02:43.980> under<00:02:44.250> saddle<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.880> tend<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
when we're under saddle we tend to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.780 
when we're under saddle we tend to
attempt<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> Piaf<00:02:47.100> out<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> trot

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
attempt to do the Piaf out of the trot

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.020 
attempt to do the Piaf out of the trot
because<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.780> beat<00:02:49.020> gait<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.560> trot

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
because it is a to beat gait it's a trot

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.580 
because it is a to beat gait it's a trot
rhythm<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.810> don't<00:02:51.990> want<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.230> confuse<00:02:52.500> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
rhythm and you don't want to confuse it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.040 
rhythm and you don't want to confuse it
with<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.890> walk<00:02:53.070> they<00:02:53.970> tend<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.360> start<00:02:54.660> jigging

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
with the walk they tend to start jigging

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.330 
with the walk they tend to start jigging
in<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> walk<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:55.920> that

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
in the walk if you do that

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.400 
in the walk if you do that
so<00:02:57.330> I'll<00:02:57.450> start<00:02:57.720> trotting<00:02:58.550> hopefully<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.260> do

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
so I'll start trotting hopefully so I do

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.410 
so I'll start trotting hopefully so I do
a<00:03:04.500> small<00:03:04.800> circle<00:03:05.310> Alfredo<00:03:05.760> does<00:03:06.000> enough<00:03:06.240> work

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
a small circle Alfredo does enough work

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.240 
a small circle Alfredo does enough work
already<00:03:06.750> having<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.230> lead<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.920> horse<00:03:08.100> around

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
already having to lead the horse around

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.240 
already having to lead the horse around
so<00:03:08.850> try<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.690> minimize<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.380> him<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.740> then

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
so try and minimize it for him and then

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.950 
so try and minimize it for him and then
I'll<00:03:11.340> come<00:03:11.550> around<00:03:11.670> again<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:12.480> quite<00:03:12.630> ready

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
I'll come around again not quite ready

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:22.070 
I'll come around again not quite ready
and<00:03:19.790> then<00:03:20.790> we'll<00:03:20.940> try<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.390> half<00:03:21.540> steps<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
and then we'll try for the half steps to

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.700 
and then we'll try for the half steps to
begin<00:03:22.320> with<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:23.520> can
