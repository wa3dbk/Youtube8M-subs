00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.909 
of angled right here and I prefer that
one<00:04:35.630> just<00:04:35.780> because<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.080> could<00:04:36.229> hit<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.530> apples

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
one just because I could hit the apples

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.170

going to sweep outward kind of in a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.210 
going to sweep outward kind of in a
circular<00:04:46.820> motion<00:04:47.210> right<00:04:47.570> here<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.620> has

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
circular motion right here and this has

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.010 
circular motion right here and this has
little<00:04:49.400> gold<00:04:49.699> speckles<00:04:50.330> in<00:04:50.449> it<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.870> also

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
little gold speckles in it so it also

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.779 
little gold speckles in it so it also
like<00:04:51.320> picks<00:04:51.560> up<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.919> reflects<00:04:52.250> like<00:04:52.490> that's

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
like picks up and reflects like that's

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.450 
like picks up and reflects like that's

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
going to look too overdone so this is

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.939 
going to look too overdone so this is
just<00:06:15.690> like<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:15.960> neutral<00:06:16.470> if<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.650> can<00:06:16.740> kind<00:06:16.889> of
