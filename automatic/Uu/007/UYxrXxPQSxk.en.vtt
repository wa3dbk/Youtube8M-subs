00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 very good to all welcome auto skin 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.049
 this recipe of the sad and thief and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.380
 let's start with the war cries between 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.160
 the Spanish and Latin English versions 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.889
 precisely in the order mentioned 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.470
 cheat is a nice way to say 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.140
 winner 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.620
 I have never lost a clean game nor 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.200
 I have played none 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.180
 only an idiot plays with the hand that 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.300
 dan 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.650
 there are only two jesters in the deck and I 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.980
 you touch 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.980
 i 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.390
 ah 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.140
 I have never lost a game cleanly 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.570
 nor played any 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.190
 cheat is a nice way to say 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.710
 winner 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.430
 only an idiot plays with the hand that 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.400
 dan 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.030
 there are only two jesters in the deck and I 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.030
 you touch 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.160
 those of fair game world with one 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 word 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.710
 6 hendrix high 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.180
 you told me 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.280
 the dance 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.920
 let's go to the skills let's start with the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.880
 coop 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.880
 the w 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.250
 it's house kitchen 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.440
 i 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.440
 I have it 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.060
 and the r 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.090
 it is destiny 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.810
 death 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.510
 the record of recovery 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.599
 I want to make it clear that the latter 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.340
 section is a purely opinion 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.260
 personal and does not have to be relevant 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.319
 towards your opinion or your future 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.349
 buy good you hardware store 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.810
 I think the first skin that gives it 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.030
 good that takes off his hat is to say 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.819
 the only skin that does not have a hat like 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.090
 so the others I think remember that all 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.129
 they had hats and in this is not it 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.959
 only one that has stood out for me 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.680
 a normal and current skin of the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.900
 lot of efe that has many and 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.810
 they are all practically the same 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.849
 Well, the suit and little else I do not know. 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.060
 ends up convincing none without a dt efe 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.280
 except logically the saga corner of the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.590
 legacy I think it is that is the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.690
 underworld that is to those 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.160
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.629
 they want to give I like to share 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.170
 comment and see you in the next 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.170
