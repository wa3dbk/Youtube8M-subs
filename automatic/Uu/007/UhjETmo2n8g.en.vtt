00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the thermo shift jug now we're just

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
the thermo shift jug now we're just
gonna<00:00:32.309> coarsely<00:00:32.700> chop<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.329> vanilla<00:00:33.750> bean

gonna coarsely chop out vanilla bean

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.950 
gonna coarsely chop out vanilla bean
as<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:34.950> we're<00:00:35.070> using<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.670> bean<00:00:36.239> itself<00:00:36.719> or

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
as I say we're using the bean itself or

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590 
as I say we're using the bean itself or
the<00:00:37.050> pod<00:00:37.290> itself<00:00:37.680> plus<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> seeds<00:00:39.210> so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the pod itself plus all of the seeds so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.819 
the pod itself plus all of the seeds so
just<00:00:39.989> give<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> rough<00:00:40.770> chop<00:00:40.829> through

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
now we're just going to scrape those

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
now we're just going to scrape those
chopped<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.189> vanilla<00:01:05.430> beans<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.570> our

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
chopped up vanilla beans down into our

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
chopped up vanilla beans down into our
sugar<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.439> blitz<00:01:08.010> them<00:01:08.220> until<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> fine

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
sugar and blitz them until it's a fine

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.330

we're just gonna put this on the highest
speed<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.130> minute<00:01:21.140> after<00:01:22.140> minute

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

this is what you should have your

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.800 
this is what you should have your
vanilla<00:01:24.210> bean<00:01:24.479> has<00:01:24.720> turned<00:01:25.049> into<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.770> paste

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sugars really really finely powdered as

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
sugars really really finely powdered as

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.800 
well the moisture that you see in there
is<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:32.009> has<00:01:32.159> emitted<00:01:32.850> from<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> inside<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
is what has emitted from the inside of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.850 
is what has emitted from the inside of
the<00:01:33.869> vanilla<00:01:34.049> beans<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.590> showed<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the vanilla beans and I showed you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.999 
the vanilla beans and I showed you
earlier<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:36.060> smells<00:01:36.750> great

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
earlier and this smells great

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
earlier and this smells great

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
sugar from turning back into crystals

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.090 
sugar from turning back into crystals
okay<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.159> our<00:01:44.280> water
