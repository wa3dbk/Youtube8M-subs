00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.000
 finally speaks extender ediction 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.980
 came out a few minutes fake estimate then 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 They are definitely one of the first to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 is playing an investigative technique 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.740
 it seems developers relationship in Italy 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.119
 he was in charge of the academy 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 for the lucky owners of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859
 videogame from the beginning this 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 completely the theater we have 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.769
 immediately to play 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.539
 clearly it is an extended version is 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.680
 increases the game's longevity and therefore 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.129
 let's dive immediately 22 days 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.600
 it rains the same and what has changed 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.380
 make sure foods that have risen from 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.660
 a mother behind writes 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.480
 and as such not very long English 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 original version is also what it is 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.220
 wrote that the original photo of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.090
 low demand considering that the place that 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.090
 there is a veiled cape 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.430
 well now we'll have to use it as for 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.430
 the original version this role 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.770
 let's do the trans is approached this 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.729
 looks like without knowing why it is 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.729
 all to discover 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.790
 and above all to give one of 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.230
 division 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.210
 after all that they were afterwards 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.280
 the impact 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.830
 and that the graphics in general although from 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.680
 been do of average value really is 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.230
 been implemented 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.230
 ban ki moon 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.850
 ok 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.790
 to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 so also bring cut back from a 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.210
 sure it is much more professional offered 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.080
 the place 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.000
 yes yes yes yes okay 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.479
 I think seven games are rather sinister 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 so 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.679
 all compared to the original version 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.629
 how beautiful as always to do what 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.629
 many of rocks 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.600
 certainly not there 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.620
 but I see that it has really been modified 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.710
 what a stupid day this is what a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.180
 eye shape 11 cable would be offered 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.480
 a novara simplicity room in one 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.540
 night 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.090
 but really all changed 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.590
 puzzles you must excuse me for 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.090
 rumors played at least twice must 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.390
 be principal and therefore there is the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:45.190
 personal and primary and small grace 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.670
 mass looks broken 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.180
 ah ok ok a few things are incarnated 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.920
 I have to concentrate on the little door 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:06.400
 there is always what there is that everything has 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:08.410
 said but what we die of peter does not exist 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.710
 I can do this is really bad 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.270
 changed point from you we take the stone 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:20.130
 I don't know why in the primary version 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.130
 she took nothing 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.989
 let's see if not wait here but I see that 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.940
 really loves to block the tide of 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.360
 change that there is another door is closed 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.310
 maybe openable inside the pau una 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.140
 consequently new wing is surely 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.430
 a nascando here it is videnda stick 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.430
 money from unpublished works 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.460
 he said there is something tern 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.750
 wanted good spirit of second hooligan 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:58.550
 me exact piece risk levels of 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:05.480
 soccer does not arrive if you are not from 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.480
 accuses this beautiful beautiful wings of the beautiful 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.560
 tenth gear that there must be 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:19.350
 the other dirty object will want 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.340
 dirty object I don't know where it was 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.970
 technological the beard 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:33.850
 moreover piece milk of gears and 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:37.690
 souls are perfect for perfection 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.580
 if for something to tie a rope but 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.560
 oh well so far it seems to be me 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.820
 quite simple or perfect wall that 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.660
 port ca n't do it to 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.660
 batons knife 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:03.860
 yes I understand that it doesn't go boston to not 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:06.610
 think it fucking fright ok like it 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.900
 where in the normal way 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.900
 version you are or who for him 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.210
 in the meantime it is giving out more noise 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.840
 cool and then what is it that there are gods 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:25.100
 engagements 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:32.300
 well it seems pretty obvious but sure 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:34.550
 if it's enough that you shit normally 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.530
 you enter from this main door to 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.849
 the version is also basic but there is one 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.510
 also a door to behind here are 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.010
 curious of never closed anything I don't know 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.660
 because they said they added but 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.800
 it goes I would say 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.800
 and care
