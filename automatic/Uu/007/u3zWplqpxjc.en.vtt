00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.190
 hello girls and guys how are they good 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.959
 I come to you a super simple recipe 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.339
 let's see that even a child can not do it 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.559
 as you see nothing else that takes two 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.140
 ingredients so let's start are 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.000
 some chocolates with hazelnuts 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.320
 so we're going to center the chocolate 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.779
 with milk and I'm going to use this one 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.050
 tirma that is Canary and I'm going to use 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.050
 some hazelnuts these are from the spa 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.559
 with toasted hazelnuts 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.449
 and of course from the middle 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:44.329
 because the biggest mold and nothing this 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.670
 it's a heart-shaped mold then it 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.699
 it would be like this with the little hole is here 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.180
 and like inside, so if 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.920
 they want then buy a bigger one or 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.170
 as you want so let's start with 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.149
 melt what is good chocolate 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.839
 we go first of all to melt what 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.909
 are three rows of squares because I do not know 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.920
 if there will be a lot of chocolate because 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.830
 holes are tiny then 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.010
 let's melt this first 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.740
 and if we see that we lack chocolate 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.740
 we melt more no problem 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.990
 we put it on a low flame 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.920
 Well, I'm seeing that it's not going to be 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.340
 so pos and that in the end I'm going to throw 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 all 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.450
 and good now if we say everything 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.300
 and once I'm rather pulling 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.670
 to the liquid, as we will reserve it for 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.620
 happen to put it what in the north by 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.200
 On the other hand, I'm going to start 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.290
 hazelnuts in half to be able 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.830
 have them ready well we have it 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.000
 ready 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.080
 I split the hazelnuts in half and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.200
 let's place one then in each in each 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.200
 hole 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.300
 and now let's add what is the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.490
 chocolate 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.950
 very carefully because of course they are 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.250
 very tiny holes then more 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.800
 that nothing to not go out on the outside 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.800
 You have to have a lot of patience but good 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.290
 then at the end already 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.290
 but reviewing 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.320
 plus 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.470
 and well I'm finishing the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.480
 chocolates and now we continue 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.910
 well they are already filled now with a 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.350
 napkin we have given what is the tip 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.600
 to clean the little ones 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.360
 the small site that has come out 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.360
 and so that no stains remain 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.230
 It takes a little patience but good 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.230
 It is not so much 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.180
 if they want to make white chocolate for 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.590
 the same as red and white chocolate 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.590
 and the same process 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.770
 good 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.210
 and it would be now I'm going to put it in the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.010
 freezer and when I saw that what 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.370
 make up are hard that are with the 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.540
 well since past demolding good 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.330
 Now let's visit a dish where 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.800
 plating here are already ready have been 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.050
 been about an hour what is in 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.080
 the freezer and well nothing like it's 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.040
 silicone as we tighten below and the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.700
 chocolate is going up 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.650
 and look you can even see the hazelnut bit 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.170
 so nothing now is to do it with all 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.520
 same we go squeezing up what 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.360
 good thing about silicone is that it leaves you 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.950
 work then you can look it will look 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.260
 beautiful not for several great pieces 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.730
 So, the good thing about silicone is 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.340
 that lets you work and you let me get out 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.650
 he composes it and well then nothing I stay 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 and ending and now I teach them good 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.500
 Well, we have them ready, we're going to 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.750
 put a little bit the fridge so that 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.070
 give a bit of cold and good then nothing that 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.840
 I tell them we'll see each other in the next 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.840
 video a little kiss and see you soon
