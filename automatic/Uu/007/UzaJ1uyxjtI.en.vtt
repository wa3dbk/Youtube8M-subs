 demand is greater although it has two 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.790
 tracks the current airport does not have 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.400
 enough space to perform 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.890
 takeoffs or simultaneous landings this 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.070

 it's about a transexenal project with 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.950
 vision to the future which implies that the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.140
 new terminal to be built in 4 thousand 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.610
 430 hectares of federal land

 located in the area contiguous to the current 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.840
 airport will be ready in a 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.600

 responsibility and not looking at that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.830
 We can deliver in the very short term 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.830

 sustainable the most efficient and the most 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.340
 beautiful is what makes this 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.290
 airport is unique in its kind since 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.599
 a structure has a different form 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.670
 different does not have a conventional roof 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.629
 does not have vertical walls does not have 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.879
 columns in the traditional sense of a 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.640

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.269
 cultural richness of mexico with a 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.849
 terminal building in the form of X and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.409
 elements like the sun the eagle the nopal 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.030
 and the snake of our shield 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.129
 national as part of the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.739
 infrastructure the investment will be of 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.950
 around 120 billion pesos 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.840

 in hydraulic road infrastructure and 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.569
 sustainability in addition to the 160 thousand 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.400
 jobs that its construction will generate 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.610
 will have facilities 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 that reduces water consumption in addition to 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.099
 100 the water in the terminal will be treated 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.049

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.689
 airport will not take water that 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.239
