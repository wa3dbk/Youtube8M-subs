00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
tough guy I've got a strong back and I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.389 
tough guy I've got a strong back and I
can<00:00:45.719> use<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.500> take<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.070> do

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
can use that and I can take it I can do

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
can use that and I can take it I can do
it<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> does<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.809> causes<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it but what it does is it causes the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
it but what it does is it causes the
muscles<00:00:49.920> along<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> sides<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> spine<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
muscles along the sides of the spine to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
muscles along the sides of the spine to
really<00:00:52.230> become<00:00:52.379> agitated<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.520> become<00:00:53.789> sore

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
really become agitated to become sore

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
really become agitated to become sore
and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.449> pull<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> nerves<00:00:55.260> when<00:00:55.590> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and then pull on the nerves when you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
and then pull on the nerves when you
bond<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> nerves<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.520> nerves<00:00:56.699> trigger<00:00:57.030> other

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
bond the nerves and nerves trigger other

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
bond the nerves and nerves trigger other
muscles<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.800> column<00:00:59.340> your

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
muscles and then take your column your

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580 
muscles and then take your column your
spinal<00:00:59.940> column<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.930> pull<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
spinal column and they pull it out of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.729 
spinal column and they pull it out of
whack<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.190> call<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> subluxation<00:01:03.739> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
whack and call that a subluxation and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
whack and call that a subluxation and
basically<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.880> muscles<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.720> nerves

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
basically just have muscles and nerves

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.920 
basically just have muscles and nerves
that<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.770> vicious<00:01:07.950> cycle<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.930> caused

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that are in a vicious cycle that caused

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
that are in a vicious cycle that caused
you<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> whack<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> month

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
cartridge struts and I was pulling on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
cartridge struts and I was pulling on
the<00:01:19.200> ridge<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.740> pulling<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> crazy<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the ridge just pulling like crazy and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580

they<00:01:21.090> used<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.509> back<00:01:21.810> muscles<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.409> pull

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
they used to my back muscles to pull

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.670 
they used to my back muscles to pull
that<00:01:22.740> rusty<00:01:23.220> being<00:01:23.700> apart<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.630> basically<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that rusty being apart and basically I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.230 
that rusty being apart and basically I
felt<00:01:25.920> something<00:01:26.189> didn't<00:01:26.549> hurt<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.210> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.390 
in order but basically you want somebody
that<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.860> handle<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.840> anyway<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.829> you

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
that can handle it so anyway and you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.620 
that can handle it so anyway and you
know<00:03:23.519> I've<00:03:23.610> been<00:03:23.670> doing<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.209> since<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.600> was

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
know I've been doing this since I was

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.440 
know I've been doing this since I was
eight<00:03:24.900> years<00:03:25.079> old<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.500> 34<00:03:26.070> now<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.730> I've<00:03:27.239> had<00:03:27.420> a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
eight years old on 34 now so I've had a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.729 
eight years old on 34 now so I've had a
long<00:03:27.660> time<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:27.989> be<00:03:28.260> able<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.500> get<00:03:28.590> those

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
long time to be able to get those

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.530 
long time to be able to get those
muscles<00:03:28.950> getting<00:03:29.489> strong<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.090> certain<00:03:30.420> places

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
muscles getting strong in certain places

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.960 
muscles getting strong in certain places
so<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:31.799> be<00:03:31.920> hard<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.190> crack<00:03:32.459> some<00:03:32.760> time

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
so it can be hard to crack some time

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.240 
so it can be hard to crack some time
