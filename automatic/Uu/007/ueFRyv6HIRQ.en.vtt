 last combination I'm going directly 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.139
 no he allows himself luxury because he 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.970
 probably he has a tiny 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.330
 little leeway he plays 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:12.290
 with against himself and he takes this 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:17.640
 time needed to hit the road 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:20.850
 along the road is long and 8 coming 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.650

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.720
 difficulty in difficulty respect 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.700
 that a jump the easiest jump and 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.370
 already worth it could already started to 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.860
 give 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.389
 you can start going up to 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.330
 end to end its gold stocks 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:48.330
 and he has eight seconds left to finish 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:52.530
