Tommy being gifted or dream and I'm
enjoying<00:05:58.849> party<00:05:59.570> theory<00:05:59.840> I<00:05:59.870> suppose<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.860> the

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
enjoying party theory I suppose and the

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.520 
enjoying party theory I suppose and the
dad<00:06:01.580> very<00:06:01.789> strange<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.389> really<00:06:03.020> pushed<00:06:03.289> the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
dad very strange that really pushed the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.839 
dad very strange that really pushed the
boundary<00:06:03.830> and<00:06:03.979> I<00:06:04.010> think<00:06:04.220> that<00:06:04.370> way<00:06:04.550> is<00:06:04.580> the

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
boundary and I think that way is the

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.730 
boundary and I think that way is the
rawest<00:06:05.000> I<00:06:05.510> think<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.020> we<00:06:06.229> cross<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.710> line

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
rawest I think that we cross the line

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.339 
rawest I think that we cross the line
here<00:06:07.130> and<00:06:07.250> again<00:06:07.490> because<00:06:08.419> this<00:06:08.539> or<00:06:08.780> you<00:06:09.139> have
