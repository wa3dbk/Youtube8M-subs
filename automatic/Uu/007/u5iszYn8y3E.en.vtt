00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.540
 and research that allows us to learn more 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.790
 from your own experience and 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.620
 seconds because you 're preparing for 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.820
 to finalize an investigation at the end in 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.970
 your career by which surely 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.220
 you can 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 closing the thesis project 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.980
 investigation and so evidently 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.980
 fulfill it 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:46.610
 the controlled way is basically 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.700
 as an integral part of the plan 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.809
 formation is to say that whatever 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.750
 our institution 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.300
 private public university 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.300
 let's worry that from the beginning the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.760
 student in the first courses in the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.759
 first semesters now in some 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.130
 investigations throughout the process 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:09.320
 deepen apply criteria 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.270
 let's say a bit more research 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.729
 sophisticated only career and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.770
 end of the career contribution to the consumer 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:22.429
 to the general new knowledge with its 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.289
 thesis is a research project I 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.180
 I think the main mistakes are given 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.930
 in 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.400
 on several levels 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.950
 a timely topic 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.600
 structure identify a good problem 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 and description an interesting question 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 and another one that's why it's fundamental that it's 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.100
 characteristic 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.430
 in many projects 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.560
 that do not reach adequate standards is 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.909
 that in some other way from our 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.860
 selection in the tool 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.560
 research and allows you to achieve the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.360
 objectives is to say once a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.759
 authentic of the problem and knows what is it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.710
 who wants to get that question 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.509
 needs to resolve identify what 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.600
 research tools that allows 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.460
 give answers to questions then there are 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.069
 quantitative tools exist in the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.709
 same line but a big mistake is to 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.150
 sometimes generalize on the basis of 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.340
 tools that allow us to do 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.750
 generalizations really take the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.480
 opinion of a very small group of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.910
 people a very small sample and about 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 the basis of them generalize to the whole 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.260
 region or the entire country 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.560
 It is considered that there are three decisions 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.560
 fundamentals of the university 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 one of them is always the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.840
 absence of transmitting knowledge 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.180
 another one is the investigation not 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.920
 only transmit but general and the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.870
 third is the social projection 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.790
 all are articulated in 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.950
 investigations is a basis of them 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.720
 because a good university one 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.940
 university generates professionals 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.980
 nationals is a university that has 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.110
 professors who investigate 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.599
 and therefore they are updated and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.980
 can help their customers better in the 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.920
 process of developing their 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.739
 research skills that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.739
 sense there is no modern university 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.129
 from the most comprehensive approach if that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.129
 the university is not made in the strait
