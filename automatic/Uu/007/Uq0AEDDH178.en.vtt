for<00:01:06.450> each<00:01:06.540> other<00:01:06.720> playing<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.710> right

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
for each other playing not all right

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.300 
for each other playing not all right
ball<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:09.510> didn't<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:09.960> into<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> spread

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
