00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.019
 and we will strengthen our land 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.169
 crossbars to us here such 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.290
 plastic tape which 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.010
 is used 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.010
 for bags 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:30.270
 corsets for caps cut regina so 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 so that we had a ring make ends 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.830
 on top of each other and these two 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.920
 plastic stripes wrapping around 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.580
 we hook the hook into the canvas 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.710
 grabbing a working thread and tying 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.739
 single crochet 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.120
 when we finished the series 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.879
 over the bars of the previous row still 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:07.310
 just knitting a row of columns without 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:18.960
 nakida that is once again grabbing 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:22.920
 regina tying 2 2 1 row knit 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.150
 one by one column above and so 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.190
 we finished with the end of the series now 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.190
 we thread the thread inside the canvas 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:52.270
 like this 2-3 centimeters will be enough 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:59.670
 and slightly push our fishing line to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.670
 here we do not wrinkle it so evenly 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 where we have 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:18.160
 fishing line two layers it will move apart a little 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:20.760
 try to do it evenly so that 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.599
 don't drag don't do it anymore 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:31.959
 Otherwise, less is more difficult. 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:37.170
 it's easier to do more of the smaller and here 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.430
 thanks to fishing line we are increasing 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.950
 diameter of our fields 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:49.500
 fishing line will pull the field here they are 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 will look like this
