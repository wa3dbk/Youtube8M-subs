00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:14.799
 session these are CÃ¡ceres and I'm going to 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:20.200
 teach how to fix a defective video 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:22.170
 that brings a hung 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.790
 let's try to solve the problem 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.620
 is this technique serves for any 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:34.060
 thread also for example super flow of 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.770
 zoom that gives things twisted to 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.510
 place these three defects of 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.290
 manufacturing or simply bad 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 placement of the morochas 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:58.090
 who have problems in the water until 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 Cooking point and keep the vinyl 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.550
 inside until it is half 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 approximately 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.780
 you will not regret it 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.329
 the thing 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.329
 I always try to tell you 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.240
 is what we have achieved 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.960
 and I think it's still not too much 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.189
 water quality so surely 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.189
 repeat burgos of your skin 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 nothing happens I would repeat because I started 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.280
 think 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.430
 and as you can see 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.690
 and I was not liking anymore I spoke like 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.690
 like before 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 have to remove precious 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.940
 total as I do not want someone but 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.960
 never like I would do it like I do 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.960
 do the peak in loiu 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.390
 for topics 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.780
 a few seconds have passed let's see if 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.780
 Really 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.750
 but who has sung us 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.900
 is that they do not have water yet 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.540
 with this 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.940
 I'm going to stop the video for what 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.940
 so I noticed something strange 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.250
 good for this have happened to the 25 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.300
 seconds 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.300
 as I've checked before, life was 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.300
 bent 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.520
 increasingly 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.330
 and something intentional 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.019
 perfect villa and stay a brought from 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.010
 perfect let's do it with this that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.150
 is this little bit more famous 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.739
 separatist for back 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.060
 I'm going to leave it another 25 seconds 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.060
 we compare the video 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.920
 if you're 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.580
 d 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.230
 what comes out 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.330
 I will not repeat the operation with these 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.770
 three that are broken 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.450
 a little 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.530
 always coming in front 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.260
 this also has the two tapes with 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.130
 damaged cheekbones 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.130
 this one too 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.910
 I have to be before look has already been 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.050
 completely fixed problems and a 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.870
 little half back but good 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.870
 a little more cooking and I think that 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.870
 that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.560
 it has been completely fixed 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:05:00.860
 back and completely yet 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.860
 10 15 seconds 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.439
 a video 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.360
 Well, I had some doubt 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.689
 look, I have a superfluous 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.229
 spoiled too I do not know if you can 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.030
 appreciate there you see the doubles because it 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.960
 has sold will have come without stuck in the 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.960
 bag any cost 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.720
 do not 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.270
 by I'm going to show you how 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.540
 how can you solve 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.680
 what we give in the water 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.680
 not long 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.390
 you can put a little bit cooking a 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.289
 little bit without cooking that already like you 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.750
 and I like it 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.390
 have me a little bit, let's change 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.820
 once you do we put it in the 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.820
 position that manages to access forever 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:16.310
 because if not and you let it cool down in that 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.310
 position is worth 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:23.370
 once a cold time you can check 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.389
 what 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.389
 the super flux is perfect you see it 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.710
 no appetite 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.710
 in which life does not feel 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:55.969
 what really solves this is the 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.509
 what I did before uatre the man who 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:08.360
 I was to remember the clamp but for 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:10.599
 see how it is then if we have the 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.599
 Water 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.230
 Y
