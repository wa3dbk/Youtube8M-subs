00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
relationship and so it was a lot of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
relationship and so it was a lot of
strain<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.979> our<00:01:17.040> relationship<00:01:17.280> and

time<00:02:36.350> around<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.709> learned<00:02:36.950> from<00:02:37.070> my<00:02:37.420> first

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
time around I learned from my first

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.180 
time around I learned from my first
stick<00:02:38.750> I've<00:02:38.990> done<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.470> my<00:02:39.590> second<00:02:39.980> set

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
stick I've done this is my second set

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.080 
stick I've done this is my second set
and<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:41.270> set<00:02:41.330> came<00:02:42.020> out<00:02:42.260> absolutely<00:02:42.680> perfect

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
and this set came out absolutely perfect

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.400 
and this set came out absolutely perfect
except<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.270> one<00:02:44.450> thing<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.690> do<00:02:44.750> wish<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.380> a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
except for one thing I do wish it was a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.110 
except for one thing I do wish it was a
little<00:02:45.680> bit<00:02:45.860> more<00:02:46.100> layered<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:49.790> see<00:02:49.910> most

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
little bit more layered you can see most

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.430 
little bit more layered you can see most
of<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.300> yarn<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.660> kind<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.930> hitting<00:02:51.080> me<00:02:51.260> at<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
of the yarn is kind of hitting me at the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.010 
of the yarn is kind of hitting me at the
same<00:02:51.650> spot<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.310> think<00:02:53.209> would<00:02:53.330> lay<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> lot<00:02:53.780> better

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
same spot I think would lay a lot better

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.600 
same spot I think would lay a lot better
if<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.230> was<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> lot<00:02:54.620> more<00:02:54.650> layering<00:02:55.100> would<00:02:55.459> look

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
if it was a lot more layering would look

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.580 
if it was a lot more layering would look
a<00:02:55.700> little<00:02:55.850> bit<00:02:56.090> more<00:02:56.270> natural<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.290> think<00:02:57.500> it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
a little bit more natural but I think it

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.650 
a little bit more natural but I think it
looks<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> really<00:02:58.220> great<00:02:58.459> as<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.180> did

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
looks with a really great as it is I did

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.729 
looks with a really great as it is I did
the<00:02:59.690> two<00:02:59.930> straight<00:03:00.230> met<00:03:00.380> thick<00:03:00.560> all

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
the two straight met thick all

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.890 
the two straight met thick all
throughout<00:03:01.100> my<00:03:01.160> whole<00:03:01.430> head<00:03:01.670> where<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.690> only

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
throughout my whole head where you only

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.560 
throughout my whole head where you only
use<00:03:03.080> two<00:03:03.320> strands<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.739> yarn<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.280> braid<00:03:04.580> the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
use two strands of yarn to braid the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.440 
use two strands of yarn to braid the
yarn<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.590> did<00:03:06.830> my<00:03:07.010> parts<00:03:07.459> relatively<00:03:08.090> small

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
yarn and I did my parts relatively small

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.090 
yarn and I did my parts relatively small
because<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.410> know<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.530> wanted<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.830> type

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
because I just you know I wanted to type

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.750 
because I just you know I wanted to type
them<00:03:10.310> look<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.880> them<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:13.130> just<00:03:13.370> worked<00:03:13.610> out

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
them look to them and it just worked out

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.890 
them look to them and it just worked out
great<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.959> not<00:03:15.140> heavy<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.860> did<00:03:16.459> do<00:03:16.850> them<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.360> tad

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
great it's not heavy I did do them a tad

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.520 
great it's not heavy I did do them a tad
bit<00:03:18.110> shorter<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.780> one<00:03:20.780> thing<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.019> learned<00:03:21.200> also

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
bit shorter and one thing I learned also

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.750 
bit shorter and one thing I learned also
from<00:03:22.030> my<00:03:23.030> boyfriend<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:24.430> when<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.550> do

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
from my boyfriend is that when you do

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.229 
from my boyfriend is that when you do
these<00:03:25.970> yarn<00:03:26.300> braids<00:03:27.100> when<00:03:28.100> we<00:03:28.519> first<00:03:28.910> finished

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
these yarn braids when we first finished

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.030 
these yarn braids when we first finished
them<00:03:29.420> they<00:03:29.540> tend<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.810> be<00:03:29.959> very<00:03:29.989> very<00:03:30.290> stiff<00:03:30.830> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
them they tend to be very very stiff and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.550 
them they tend to be very very stiff and
firm<00:03:31.630> they<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> stiffness<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.440> them

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
firm they have that stiffness to them

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.040 
firm they have that stiffness to them
but<00:03:33.739> when<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:33.920> dip<00:03:34.340> them<00:03:34.489> in<00:03:34.700> hot<00:03:34.970> water<00:03:35.360> it

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
so I don't think I was kind of eligible

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.110 
so I don't think I was kind of eligible
anyway<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:27.070> it<00:04:27.190> wasn't<00:04:27.460> really<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.639> big<00:04:27.759> deal<00:04:27.940> to

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
anyway so it wasn't really a big deal to

anyway so it wasn't really a big deal to
me<00:04:28.210> but<00:04:28.560> that's<00:04:29.560> what<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:29.949> so<00:04:30.100> hopefully
