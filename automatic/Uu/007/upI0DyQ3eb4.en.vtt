00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
on start off with the plants that we

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.260 
on start off with the plants that we
started<00:00:39.570> off<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.809> last<00:00:40.020> time<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:42.120> new

plants are doing good the new plants are
growing<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.420> roots<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.899> coming<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.340> can

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
growing the roots are coming out you can

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540 
growing the roots are coming out you can
kind<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.750> roots<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.550> they're

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
kind of see the roots right here they're

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
kind of see the roots right here they're
on<00:00:54.469> coming<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.980> root<00:00:56.160> ball

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
right there and I should have probably

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
right there and I should have probably
cut<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.690> where<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> stem

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
cut them right there like where the stem

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.760 
cut them right there like where the stem
is<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.710> grow<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> root<00:01:06.030> ball<00:01:06.770> but

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is and grow them out the root ball but

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020 
is and grow them out the root ball but
I'm<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.520> leave<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.729> alone<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
I'm just going to leave them alone and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.580

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
roots might you know pull the plant down

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.880 
roots might you know pull the plant down
I<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> find<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.780> so

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
I don't know we're going to find out so

way next to the glass I laid that down

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.859 
way next to the glass I laid that down
because<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.729> had<00:01:26.880> roots<00:01:27.090> coming<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
because they had roots coming out a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
because they had roots coming out a
little<00:01:28.140> bit<00:01:28.259> more<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.680> these<00:01:28.799> were<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.790> I
