me fold up our box make sure the tapes

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.020 
me fold up our box make sure the tapes
good<00:02:01.130> pulled<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> box<00:02:02.550> like<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> normally

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
good pulled up the box like you normally

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.229 
good pulled up the box like you normally
would<00:02:03.270> some<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:05.810> strength<00:02:06.810> sturdiness<00:02:07.740> of

would some of the strength sturdiness of
the<00:02:09.239> box<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.959> give<00:02:12.959> way<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:14.150> fact

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the box it's going to give way to fact

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
the box it's going to give way to fact
that<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.480> took<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.810> wall<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.680> you'll

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that we took a wall out of it and you'll

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
that we took a wall out of it and you'll
notice<00:02:20.010> there's<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.370> space<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.940> side<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
notice there's a space on the side you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.090 
notice there's a space on the side you
can<00:02:21.630> fix<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.320> with<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:22.530> tape<00:02:22.920> on

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
can fix that just with a little tape on

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.160 
can fix that just with a little tape on
the<00:02:23.190> bottom<00:02:24.920> right<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.750> may<00:02:27.900> or<00:02:28.050> may

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the bottom right there you may or may

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.580 
the bottom right there you may or may
not<00:02:28.200> want<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> it'll<00:02:31.260> take<00:02:31.470> that

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
not want to do this so it'll take that

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.120 
not want to do this so it'll take that
gap<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.769> there<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.010> your

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
gap out there and there you have your

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.580 
gap out there and there you have your
box<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:35.700> normally<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> while<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.170> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
box now normally to be a while here that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
box now normally to be a while here that
would<00:02:37.680> hit<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.220> lid<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.420> fold<00:02:39.630> this

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
would hit the lid so when you fold this
