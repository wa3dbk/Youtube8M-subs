00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
taking a look at something really quite

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.959 
taking a look at something really quite
fun<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.920> Technicolor<00:00:11.429> compact

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
fun and that is this Technicolor compact

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.940 
fun and that is this Technicolor compact
disco<00:00:12.450> beacon<00:00:12.900> now<00:00:13.380> if<00:00:13.500> you're<00:00:13.620> wondering

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
disco beacon now if you're wondering

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.289 
disco beacon now if you're wondering
what<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.309> these<00:00:14.400> does<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.880> pretty<00:00:15.089> much

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
what one of these does it pretty much

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.939 
what one of these does it pretty much
does<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.750> says<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> tin<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.500> turns

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
does what it says on the tin it turns

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.920 
does what it says on the tin it turns
your<00:00:17.070> beacon<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> bit<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.420> ray<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
your beacon into a bit of a ray with the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540 
your beacon into a bit of a ray with the
beam<00:00:19.170> turning<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.740> various<00:00:20.189> different

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
beam turning all various different

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.189 
beam turning all various different
colors<00:00:20.699> you'll<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.330> able<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.630> spot<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> thing

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
colors you'll be able to spot this thing

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.660 
colors you'll be able to spot this thing
from<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> mile<00:00:22.619> off<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.160> reason<00:00:23.519> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
from a mile off and for that reason I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.460 
from a mile off and for that reason I
think<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.449> very<00:00:24.630> cool<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.289> let's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
think it's really very cool so let's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
think it's really very cool so let's
take<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> closer<00:00:25.949> look<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.939> case<00:00:27.119> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
take a closer look now in case you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.670 
take a closer look now in case you
hadn't<00:00:27.449> noticed<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.900> machine<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.470> currently

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
hadn't noticed the machine is currently

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.990 
hadn't noticed the machine is currently
switched<00:00:28.980> off<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.460> we're<00:00:29.580> quickly<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
switched off but we're quickly going to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
switched off but we're quickly going to
change<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.420> by<00:00:30.539> flicking<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.990> lever<00:00:31.170> down

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
change that by flicking this lever down

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
change that by flicking this lever down
here<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.610> our<00:00:32.850> beacon

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
here and as you can see our beacon

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.060 
here and as you can see our beacon
really<00:00:33.750> does<00:00:33.930> spring<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> life<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
really does spring it in to life all of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
really does spring it in to life all of
the<00:00:35.250> colors<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.700> travelling<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.480> through<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the colors are travelling up through the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
the colors are travelling up through the
beam<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> say<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
beam and I have to say it really is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.250 
beam and I have to say it really is
quite<00:00:39.000> impressive<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.690> thing<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> really

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
quite impressive one thing that I really

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
quite impressive one thing that I really
like<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.739> design<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.610> fact<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
like about this design is the fact that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
like about this design is the fact that
the<00:00:41.969> transition<00:00:42.540> between<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.020> colors<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the transition between the colors is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
the transition between the colors is
actually<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.280> smooth<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:45.120> any

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
actually very smooth you don't have any

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
actually very smooth you don't have any
white<00:00:45.450> popping<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> between<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> colors<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
white popping in between the colors it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.160 
white popping in between the colors it
is<00:00:47.399> all<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> nice<00:00:48.000> transition<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is all just a nice transition go and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
is all just a nice transition go and
ride<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.530> through<00:00:49.829> them<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.789> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ride the way through them but once you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.160 
ride the way through them but once you
get<00:00:51.059> bored<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.960> whatever

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
get bored of that one for whatever

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
get bored of that one for whatever
reason<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.850> head

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
reason all you have to do is just head

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
reason all you have to do is just head
down<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.360> flick<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.690> leaver<00:00:54.899> once<00:00:55.079> again

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
down here flick this leaver once again

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
down here flick this leaver once again
and<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.309> our<00:00:56.520> beacon<00:00:56.879> returns<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and as you can see our beacon returns to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
and as you can see our beacon returns to
normal<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.020> left<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> regular

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
normal you are left with the regular

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
normal you are left with the regular
white<00:00:59.340> beam<00:00:59.640> which<00:01:00.180> still<00:01:00.390> looks<00:01:00.510> cool<00:01:00.809> but

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
white beam which still looks cool but

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930 
white beam which still looks cool but
it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.590> quite<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> disco<00:01:02.160> beacon<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it's not quite a disco beacon is it in

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.789 
it's not quite a disco beacon is it in
terms<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> actual<00:01:04.170> mechanics<00:01:04.650> behind

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
terms of the actual mechanics behind

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.080 
terms of the actual mechanics behind
this<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.339> should<00:01:05.400> probably<00:01:05.729> start<00:01:06.000> off

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this thing I should probably start off

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760 
this thing I should probably start off
by<00:01:06.299> explaining<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.229> change<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
by explaining how I actually change the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.140 
by explaining how I actually change the
color<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> beacon<00:01:08.610> beam<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:08.939> there's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
color of the beacon beam because there's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
color of the beacon beam because there's
a<00:01:09.210> recent<00:01:09.510> addition<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> Minecraft<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> some

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
a recent addition to Minecraft and some

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
a recent addition to Minecraft and some
of<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> might<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.520> heard<00:01:11.729> about<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
of you might not have heard about it so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
of you might not have heard about it so
essentially<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> play<00:01:13.530> stained<00:01:13.860> glass<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
essentially if you play stained glass in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
essentially if you play stained glass in
front<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> beacon<00:01:15.000> beam<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> see

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
front of the beacon beam as you can see

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
front of the beacon beam as you can see
it<00:01:16.290> changes<00:01:16.710> color<00:01:16.950> now<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.729> here

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it changes color now what we have here

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
it changes color now what we have here
is<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.240> bunch<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> sticky<00:01:18.840> pistons<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.619> push

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
is a bunch of sticky pistons the push

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
is a bunch of sticky pistons the push
the<00:01:20.340> stained<00:01:20.640> glass<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:21.180> top<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> beacon

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the stained glass on top of the beacon

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
the stained glass on top of the beacon
beam<00:01:22.170> meaning<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> changes<00:01:23.130> color

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
beam meaning it changes color

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
beam meaning it changes color
automatically<00:01:24.000> which<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> quite<00:01:24.840> cool

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
automatically which really is quite cool

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
automatically which really is quite cool
in<00:01:25.259> terms<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> Redstone<00:01:26.369> behind<00:01:26.610> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
in terms of the Redstone behind this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.890 
in terms of the Redstone behind this
thing<00:01:26.880> most<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> powered<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
thing most of it is powered by this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
thing most of it is powered by this
redstone<00:01:28.470> clock<00:01:28.619> which<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.310> runs<00:01:29.549> into<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
redstone clock which then runs into this

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
redstone clock which then runs into this
timing<00:01:30.270> circuit<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> allows<00:01:31.530> us<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> do

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
timing circuit what that allows us to do

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
timing circuit what that allows us to do
is<00:01:32.130> extend<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> these<00:01:32.939> Pistons<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.570> after

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is extend all of these Pistons one after

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.219 
is extend all of these Pistons one after
another

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
another

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.990 
another
so<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.740> piston<00:01:35.040> extends<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.549> pushing<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
so this piston extends up pushing the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
so this piston extends up pushing the
orange<00:01:36.360> block<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.780> front<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> beacon<00:01:37.650> beam

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
orange block in front of the beacon beam

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.380 
orange block in front of the beacon beam
which<00:01:38.009> changes<00:01:38.340> its<00:01:38.520> color<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
which changes its color and then it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.630 
which changes its color and then it
retracts<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.170> immediately<00:01:40.740> afterwards<00:01:41.100> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
retracts and immediately afterwards this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
retracts and immediately afterwards this
one<00:01:41.880> extends<00:01:42.329> pushing<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.869> block<00:01:43.170> above<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
one extends pushing this block above the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
one extends pushing this block above the
beacon<00:01:43.979> beam<00:01:44.130> meaning<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> changes<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> purple

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
beacon beam meaning it changes to purple

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
beacon beam meaning it changes to purple
the<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.170> thing<00:01:46.320> happens<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the same thing happens here here here

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
the same thing happens here here here
and<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> goes<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> top

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and here then when it goes to the top

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.480 
and here then when it goes to the top
the<00:01:49.380> redstone<00:01:49.770> clock<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.189> come<00:01:50.340> back

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the redstone clock will have come back

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
the redstone clock will have come back
around<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> whole<00:01:51.420> process<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.960> start

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
around and the whole process will start

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
around and the whole process will start
again<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.070> quite<00:01:53.220> simple<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.909> it's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
again it's really quite simple but it's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
again it's really quite simple but it's
relatively<00:01:54.390> effective<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.770> anyone<00:01:56.009> that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
relatively effective for anyone that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.260 
relatively effective for anyone that
wants<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.670> closer<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
wants to take a closer look at the

wants to take a closer look at the
Redstone<00:01:57.600> behind<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.079> perhaps<00:01:58.350> play

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
Redstone behind this thing perhaps play

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
Redstone behind this thing perhaps play
around<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> circuitry<00:01:59.460> or<00:01:59.700> even<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
around with the circuitry or even have a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
around with the circuitry or even have a
first-hand<00:02:00.509> look<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.350> disco<00:02:01.649> beacon

block another sticky piston a blog
another<00:02:26.820> sticky<00:02:27.180> piston<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.110> can

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
another sticky piston and then you can

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.720 
another sticky piston and then you can
take<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.800> those<00:02:28.980> ones<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.490> then<00:02:29.610> do

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
take out all of those ones and then do

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.950 
take out all of those ones and then do
the<00:02:29.850> same<00:02:30.030> thing<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> other<00:02:30.450> side<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.870> want

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
the same thing on the other side we want

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.600 
the same thing on the other side we want
to<00:02:31.080> place<00:02:31.230> two<00:02:31.440> blocks<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:32.460> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
to place two blocks and then that's the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.610 
to place two blocks and then that's the
sticky<00:02:32.820> piston<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> block<00:02:34.020> sticky

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
sticky piston and then a block sticky

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.680 
sticky piston and then a block sticky
piston<00:02:35.040> block<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.940> sticky<00:02:36.300> piston

piston block and then a sticky piston

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.000 
piston block and then a sticky piston
then<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.230> remove<00:02:37.500> all<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.920> those

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
then you can remove all of those

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.860 
then you can remove all of those
temporary<00:02:38.340> blocks<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:38.970> those<00:02:39.210> are<00:02:39.510> going

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
temporary blocks because those are going

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.600 
temporary blocks because those are going
to<00:02:39.930> push<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.470> stained<00:02:40.650> glass<00:02:40.680> across<00:02:41.160> so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
to push in the stained glass across so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
to push in the stained glass across so
they<00:02:41.730> intersects<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.450> beacon<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.960> next<00:02:43.830> up

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
they intersects your beacon be next up

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.320 
they intersects your beacon be next up
you<00:02:44.070> want<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.280> head<00:02:44.400> round<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> back<00:02:44.850> over<00:02:45.210> to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
you want to head round the back over to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.060 
you want to head round the back over to
this<00:02:45.480> sticky<00:02:45.840> piston<00:02:46.170> right<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.800> place

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
redstone dust now what we're going to be

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500 
redstone dust now what we're going to be
creating<00:02:53.220> here<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.700> known<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.180> redstone

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
creating here is known as a redstone

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.030 
creating here is known as a redstone
snake<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.320> going<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.650> connecting

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
snake and this is going to be connecting

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.650 
snake and this is going to be connecting
up<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.430> our<00:02:56.520> pistons<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.330> you've<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.570> an

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
up all of our pistons so you've got an

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.880 
up all of our pistons so you've got an
upside-down<00:02:57.959> half<00:02:58.290> slab<00:02:58.500> there<00:02:58.740> with

upside-down half slab there with
redstone<00:02:59.310> dust<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> top<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.360> want<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
redstone dust on the top and you want to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.480 
redstone dust on the top and you want to
place<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> three<00:03:01.260> blocks<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:01.980> then

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
place a three blocks there and then

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.190 
place a three blocks there and then
another<00:03:02.700> upside-down<00:03:03.360> half<00:03:03.720> slab<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.140> is

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
another upside-down half slab that is

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.170 
another upside-down half slab that is
redstone<00:03:04.740> there<00:03:04.770> with<00:03:05.400> two<00:03:05.670> repeaters

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
redstone there with two repeaters

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.970 
redstone there with two repeaters
running<00:03:06.450> across<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.200> redstone

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
running across just like this redstone

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.220 
running across just like this redstone
there<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.060> block<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.600> like<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.959> to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
there and then a block just like that to

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
there and then a block just like that to
stop<00:03:10.500> those<00:03:10.709> two<00:03:10.740> connecting<00:03:11.340> up<00:03:11.459> redstone

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
stop those two connecting up redstone

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.760 
stop those two connecting up redstone
dust<00:03:12.270> on<00:03:12.420> top<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.750> one<00:03:12.959> now<00:03:13.320> two<00:03:13.530> blocks

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
dust on top of that one now two blocks

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.340 
dust on top of that one now two blocks
like<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.340> repeater<00:03:15.060> redstone<00:03:15.690> dust<00:03:16.140> as

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
like this a repeater redstone dust as

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.320 
like this a repeater redstone dust as
and<00:03:16.500> I'm<00:03:16.590> sure<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.160> tell<00:03:17.340> there<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> bit

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
and I'm sure you can tell there is a bit

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.759 
and I'm sure you can tell there is a bit
of<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.540> pattern<00:03:18.780> forming<00:03:19.140> here<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.590> we've<00:03:19.739> got

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
of a pattern forming here so we've got

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.979 
of a pattern forming here so we've got
the<00:03:20.010> upside<00:03:20.340> down<00:03:20.489> half<00:03:20.700> slab<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the upside down half slab and then the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.240 
the upside down half slab and then the
three<00:03:22.290> blocks<00:03:22.560> right<00:03:22.769> there<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
three blocks right there with the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.920 
three blocks right there with the
redstone<00:03:23.610> dust<00:03:23.760> onto<00:03:24.000> both<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.480> those<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
redstone dust onto both of those and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.660 
redstone dust onto both of those and
then<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.470> two<00:03:25.650> repeaters<00:03:26.100> facing<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.519> this

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
then the two repeaters facing in this

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.280 
then the two repeaters facing in this
direction<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.900> got<00:03:28.050> our

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
direction then we have got our

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.199 
direction then we have got our
upside-down<00:03:28.680> half<00:03:29.070> slab<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.580> block<00:03:30.000> like<00:03:30.180> this

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
upside-down half slab a block like this

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.300 
upside-down half slab a block like this
our<00:03:30.660> three<00:03:31.230> blocks<00:03:31.470> going<00:03:31.680> across<00:03:31.890> like<00:03:32.130> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
our three blocks going across like that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.650 
our three blocks going across like that
with<00:03:32.489> redstone<00:03:32.790> dust<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.239> top<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.480> both<00:03:33.630> of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
with redstone dust on top of both of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.840 
with redstone dust on top of both of
those<00:03:33.930> our<00:03:34.170> repeater<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.430> redstone

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
those our repeater and then redstone

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.670 
those our repeater and then redstone
dust<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.330> finally<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.870> just<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.170> one<00:03:37.470> last

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
dust and finally we just need one last

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.470 
dust and finally we just need one last
upside-down<00:03:38.160> half<00:03:38.519> slab<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.970> then<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.300> block

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
upside-down half slab and then a block

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.270 
upside-down half slab and then a block
up<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:40.050> we've<00:03:40.440> redstone<00:03:40.860> dust<00:03:41.010> onto

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
up like this we've redstone dust onto

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.970 
up like this we've redstone dust onto
both<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.850> those<00:03:42.200> now<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> connect<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.739> all<00:03:43.860> of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
both of those now to connect to all of

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.440 
both of those now to connect to all of
these<00:03:44.100> pistons<00:03:44.549> we<00:03:44.730> against<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.090> placing

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
these pistons we against you placing

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.789 
these pistons we against you placing
blocks<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.170> we've<00:03:46.410> registered<00:03:46.739> in

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
blocks like this we've registered in

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.620 
blocks like this we've registered in
dust<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.190> top<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.459> all<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.670> those<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.209> then<00:03:48.540> you

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
dust on top of all of those and then you

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.030 
dust on top of all of those and then you
want<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.810> grab<00:03:49.019> another<00:03:49.260> block<00:03:49.709> place<00:03:50.010> it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
want to grab another block place it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.070 
want to grab another block place it
across<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.820> with<00:03:51.239> comparators

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
across like that with comparators

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.050 
across like that with comparators
running<00:03:52.680> into<00:03:53.040> those<00:03:53.190> Pistons<00:03:53.640> now<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.880> may

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
running into those Pistons now you may

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.699 
running into those Pistons now you may
be<00:03:54.120> wondering<00:03:54.540> why<00:03:54.720> am<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.900> using<00:03:54.959> comparators

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
be wondering why am I using comparators

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.229 
be wondering why am I using comparators
but<00:03:55.890> it's<00:03:56.010> simply<00:03:56.250> because<00:03:56.370> they've<00:03:56.940> got<00:03:57.209> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
but it's simply because they've got a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.210 
but it's simply because they've got a
shorter<00:03:57.780> delay<00:03:58.019> than<00:03:58.230> repeaters<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.830> that's

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
shorter delay than repeaters and that's

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.320 
shorter delay than repeaters and that's
what<00:03:59.370> we<00:03:59.459> need<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.700> get<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.000> smooth

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
what we need to get that smooth

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.810 
what we need to get that smooth
transition<00:04:00.870> between<00:04:01.019> all<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> colors<00:04:01.820> so

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
transition between all of the colors so

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.070 
transition between all of the colors so
to<00:04:02.880> start<00:04:03.209> things<00:04:03.420> off<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.840> want<00:04:04.019> to

to start things off you just want to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.900 
to start things off you just want to
head<00:04:04.260> down<00:04:04.470> here<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.920> place<00:04:05.100> two<00:04:05.370> repeaters

redstone and activate the redstone clock
finally<00:04:48.749> you<00:04:48.840> want<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.020> head<00:04:49.139> over<00:04:49.169> here<00:04:49.499> place

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
finally you want to head over here place

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.709 
finally you want to head over here place
a<00:04:49.860> lever<00:04:50.189> on<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.639> block<00:04:50.909> next<00:04:51.449> to<00:04:51.599> the

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
hopper that is going to be the input for

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.629 
hopper that is going to be the input for
the<00:04:55.319> circuit<00:04:55.680> which<00:04:55.830> allows<00:04:56.039> you<00:04:56.219> to<00:04:56.310> turn<00:04:56.490> it

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
the circuit which allows you to turn it

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.980 
the circuit which allows you to turn it
off<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:56.909> on<00:04:56.969> again<00:04:57.029> which<00:04:57.419> is<00:04:57.539> pretty<00:04:57.689> useful

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
off and on again which is pretty useful

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.050 
off and on again which is pretty useful
anyway<00:04:58.740> now<00:04:59.009> you<00:04:59.069> just<00:04:59.370> want<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.520> chuck<00:04:59.729> in<00:04:59.909> all

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
anyway now you just want to chuck in all

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.490 
anyway now you just want to chuck in all
your<00:05:00.240> stained<00:05:00.419> glass<00:05:00.659> that<00:05:00.689> is<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.110> orange

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
your stained glass that is the orange

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.379 
your stained glass that is the orange
there<00:05:01.770> then<00:05:02.219> we've<00:05:02.340> got<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.699> purple<00:05:03.120> over

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
there then we've got the purple over

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.480 
there then we've got the purple over
here<00:05:03.599> you've<00:05:03.960> got<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.319> blue<00:05:04.590> right<00:05:04.830> there<00:05:05.099> the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
here you've got the blue right there the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.670 
here you've got the blue right there the
yellow<00:05:05.879> over<00:05:06.210> on<00:05:06.300> this<00:05:06.479> side<00:05:06.719> the<00:05:07.080> green<00:05:07.349> here

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
yellow over on this side the green here

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.649 
yellow over on this side the green here
and<00:05:07.830> then<00:05:08.310> finally<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.849> pink<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.210> course<00:05:09.479> you

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
and then finally the pink of course you

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.269 
and then finally the pink of course you
can<00:05:09.810> use<00:05:09.930> whatever<00:05:10.080> colors<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.680> like<00:05:10.830> but

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279 
can use whatever colors you like but

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.529 
can use whatever colors you like but
that<00:05:11.430> seems<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.759> be<00:05:11.879> a<00:05:11.909> pretty<00:05:12.330> good

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
that seems to be a pretty good

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.969 
that seems to be a pretty good
combination<00:05:12.810> but<00:05:13.199> anyway<00:05:13.439> if<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.680> flick<00:05:13.889> this

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
combination but anyway if you flick this

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.980 
combination but anyway if you flick this
leaf<00:05:14.159> right<00:05:14.340> here<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:15.090> can<00:05:15.270> see<00:05:15.479> we<00:05:15.870> got

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
leaf right here as you can see we got

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.899 
leaf right here as you can see we got
ourselves<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.620> very<00:05:16.650> nice-looking<00:05:17.159> rainbow

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
ourselves a very nice-looking rainbow
