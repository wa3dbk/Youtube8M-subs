Foster's<00:00:56.920> &amp;<00:00:57.100> Smith<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:57.579> probably<00:00:57.970> just<00:00:58.840> about

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
Foster's &amp; Smith and probably just about

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.110 
Foster's &amp; Smith and probably just about
anywhere<00:00:59.410> and<00:01:00.280> they're<00:01:00.460> only<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.670> couple<00:01:00.760> of

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
anywhere and they're only a couple of

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.560 
anywhere and they're only a couple of
bucks<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.899> it<00:01:02.829> just<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.399> hangs<00:01:03.820> on<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.269> tank

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.499 
bucks and it just it hangs on the tank
and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.430> just<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:07.630> kind<00:01:07.899> of<00:01:07.990> gravity<00:01:08.409> fed

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
and then it just is kind of gravity fed

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.270 
and then it just is kind of gravity fed
drips<00:01:10.509> down<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.710> adjust<00:01:11.799> this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
drips down and you can adjust this

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
drips down and you can adjust this

this aquarium it has such a wide rim
around<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.530> can't<00:01:26.770> bend<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.340> fit

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
around it that you can't bend it to fit

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.010

overhead light and the two other

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.500 
overhead light and the two other
angelfish<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.370> already<00:02:12.580> had<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.000> there<00:02:13.239> they're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.110 

and<00:02:45.989> usually<00:02:46.989> when<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.860> bring<00:02:48.190> fish<00:02:48.550> home<00:02:48.849> from

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120

the<00:02:49.239> pet<00:02:49.480> store<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:51.430> mix<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.540> water<00:02:52.750> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
the pet store I don't mix the water I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.990 
the pet store I don't mix the water I
will<00:02:53.410> net<00:02:53.620> them<00:02:53.830> out<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.519> this<00:02:54.670> case<00:02:54.940> since

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
will net them out but in this case since

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.460 
will net them out but in this case since
I'm<00:02:55.480> dealing<00:02:55.900> with<00:02:55.930> angelfish<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:58.470> they're

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
I'm dealing with angelfish and they're

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.420 
I'm dealing with angelfish and they're
already<00:02:59.680> coming<00:03:00.069> out<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.430> one<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.670> my<00:03:00.910> tanks

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
look at that guy well we'll see how this

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.150 
look at that guy well we'll see how this
goes<00:03:05.950> I'm<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> go<00:03:08.019> ahead<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.950> let

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
goes I'm going to go ahead and just let

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.970 
goes I'm going to go ahead and just let
them<00:03:09.340> swim<00:03:09.640> out<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.000> bag<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.709> we'll<00:03:11.709> see

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
them swim out of the bag so we'll see

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.180 
them swim out of the bag so we'll see
angels<00:03:12.700> they<00:03:13.660> are<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> cichlid<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:14.769> we'll<00:03:15.010> see

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
angels they are a cichlid so we'll see

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:29.830 
angels they are a cichlid so we'll see
how<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.580> goes

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.670 

okay<00:03:31.030> Cardinal<00:03:32.030> tetras<00:03:32.540> they<00:03:33.110> were<00:03:33.170> thinking

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
okay Cardinal tetras they were thinking

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.589 
okay Cardinal tetras they were thinking
about<00:03:33.770> coming<00:03:34.310> out<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.000> guess<00:03:35.180> they<00:03:35.360> change

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
about coming out but I guess they change

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:47.490 
about coming out but I guess they change
