there's a lot to talk about the end of

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.850 
there's a lot to talk about the end of
an<00:03:37.000> era<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.330> finishing<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.260> cycles<00:03:38.709> and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
an era and finishing of cycles and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.530 
an era and finishing of cycles and
things<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.640> both<00:03:39.790> cities<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.390> both

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
things like that in both cities in both

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.420

Madrid<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.019> Barcelona<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.800> think<00:03:42.070> it's<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.220> bit

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
Madrid and Barcelona I think it's a bit

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.490 
Madrid and Barcelona I think it's a bit
early<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.850> jump<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.390> gun<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.600> say<00:03:43.900> Germany<00:03:44.170> is

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
early to jump the gun and say Germany is

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.199 
early to jump the gun and say Germany is
definitely<00:03:45.040> ahead<00:03:45.130> at<00:03:45.519> this<00:03:45.700> point<00:03:45.940> Spain

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
definitely ahead at this point Spain

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.520 
definitely ahead at this point Spain
still<00:03:46.450> has<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.570> lot<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.780> things<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.080> for<00:03:47.320> it

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
reason is messy messy still that the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.130 
reason is messy messy still that the
best<00:04:59.120> player<00:04:59.330> around<00:04:59.570> when<00:04:59.810> he<00:04:59.870> came<00:04:59.960> off<00:05:00.110> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
bench he scored a brilliant free-kick

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.100 
bench he scored a brilliant free-kick
was<00:05:01.790> first<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.240> Joe<00:05:02.420> mascota<00:05:02.720> penalty

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
anywhere and he'll still be the main

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.130 
anywhere and he'll still be the main
reason<00:05:06.890> I<00:05:06.950> think<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.400> watch<00:05:07.690> second<00:05:08.690> reason<00:05:08.840> is

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
reason I think to watch second reason is

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.350 
reason I think to watch second reason is
that<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:10.040> there's<00:05:10.970> gonna<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.240> lot<00:05:11.300> of

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
that and there's gonna be a lot of

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.000 
that and there's gonna be a lot of
changes<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.900> both<00:05:12.050> Barcelona<00:05:12.500> Madrid<00:05:12.860> in

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
changes that both Barcelona Madrid in

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.200 
changes that both Barcelona Madrid in
the<00:05:13.070> summer<00:05:13.280> i<00:05:13.370> think<00:05:13.610> maybe<00:05:13.820> new<00:05:13.970> players

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210
