Choi the starter plant that I bought

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
Choi the starter plant that I bought
from<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> nursery<00:00:28.010> but<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> want<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> show

from the nursery but here I want to show

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.200 
from the nursery but here I want to show
anybody<00:00:30.710> something<00:00:31.710> stem<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.700> I've<00:00:32.850> been

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
anybody something stem that I've been

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.470 
anybody something stem that I've been
trying<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.750> root<00:00:33.950> ok<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.610> enjoy<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> see

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
trying to root ok so enjoy it see

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.850 
trying to root ok so enjoy it see
semi-aquatic<00:00:37.110> plant<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.860> thrive

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
semi-aquatic plant and it really thrive

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.260 
semi-aquatic plant and it really thrive
in<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:42.210> water<00:00:42.450> environment<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:44.090> by<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
in the water environment so by that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.369 
in the water environment so by that
logic<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.860> cutting<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.550> we'll

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
logic I think the cutting well we'll

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.340 
logic I think the cutting well we'll
definitely<00:00:49.379> root<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.809> it<00:00:51.809> doesn't<00:00:52.140> hurt<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
definitely root so it doesn't hurt to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.139 
definitely root so it doesn't hurt to
try<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> did<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.170> took<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:56.149> most

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
try so what I did it took the most

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.709 
try so what I did it took the most
mature<00:00:57.890> cuttings<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.940> vegetable<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
mature cuttings from the vegetable and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
mature cuttings from the vegetable and
try<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> route<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.210> see

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
try to route them and as you can see

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.410 
try to route them and as you can see
this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> five<00:01:04.379> days<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:05.220> rooting<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this is up to five days of rooting the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
this is up to five days of rooting the
five<00:01:06.630> days<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.049> water<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.310> plants

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
five days in water and the plants

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.899 
five days in water and the plants
already<00:01:08.850> producing<00:01:09.330> roots<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.760> about

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
already producing roots this is about

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
already producing roots this is about
six<00:01:12.240> inches<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> cuttings<00:01:13.770> about<00:01:13.890> six<00:01:14.070> inches

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
look at the root system this is a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
look at the root system this is a
beautiful<00:01:19.740> root<00:01:19.890> system<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.270> every<00:01:21.540> goes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
beautiful root system here so every goes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.580 
beautiful root system here so every goes
for<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.850> roots<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:25.020> also<00:01:25.259> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.800 
actually buy them from the nursery and I
do<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> video<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.640> my<00:02:21.300> youtube

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
do have a video on that on my youtube

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.100 
do have a video on that on my youtube
channel<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:24.090> actually<00:02:24.750> bought

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
channel that that I have actually bought

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.050 
channel that that I have actually bought
three<00:02:27.020> three<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> starter<00:02:28.500> plants<00:02:29.060> so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
three three of the starter plants so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.050 
three three of the starter plants so
what<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> did<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.230> from<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.670> took<00:02:32.820> just

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
what I did is from here it's I took just

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.870 
what I did is from here it's I took just
take<00:02:33.300> about<00:02:33.570> six<00:02:33.810> inches<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> cutting

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
take about six inches of the cutting

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.850 
take about six inches of the cutting
from<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> vegetable<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:37.050> ate<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> then

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
from the vegetable that we ate and then

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.670 
from the vegetable that we ate and then
this<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:38.910> only<00:02:39.030> been<00:02:39.150> five<00:02:39.450> days<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
this has only been five days and as you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.050 
this has only been five days and as you
can<00:02:40.800> see<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.459> roots<00:02:41.670> are<00:02:42.110> well<00:02:43.110> develop

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
can see that the roots are well develop

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.520 
can see that the roots are well develop
now<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.630> second<00:02:46.140> time<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.350> try<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
now this is the second time I try and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.570 
now this is the second time I try and
root<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.950> plant<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.120> first<00:02:48.390> time<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.630> would<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
root this plant the first time I would I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.580 
root this plant the first time I would I
tried<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.180> worked<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.050> when<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.290> plant

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
tried it and it worked but when I plant

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.699 
tried it and it worked but when I plant
them<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.890> ground<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.520> whatever<00:02:54.060> reason

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
them on the ground for whatever reason

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.740 
them on the ground for whatever reason
none<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.830> them<00:02:55.920> survived<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:57.090> dried<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
none of them survived they dried out and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.020 
none of them survived they dried out and
they<00:02:57.840> die<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.400> now<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.030> rethink<00:03:00.900> how<00:03:01.739> to

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
they die so now I have to rethink how to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.850 
they die so now I have to rethink how to
transplant<00:03:03.030> them<00:03:03.209> on<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:04.050> ground<00:03:04.290> or<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.770> a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
transplant them on the ground or in a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.970 
transplant them on the ground or in a
container<00:03:05.810> they<00:03:06.810> need<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.020> lot<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.290> moisture<00:03:07.500> so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
container they need a lot of moisture so

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.070 
container they need a lot of moisture so
maybe<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.459> moisture<00:03:08.850> was<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> factor<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:12.080> first

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
maybe the moisture was a factor so first

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.840 
maybe the moisture was a factor so first
when<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.350> first<00:03:13.530> tried<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.860> work<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.130> you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
when you first tried to work this you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.300 
when you first tried to work this you
would<00:03:14.970> try<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.209> put<00:03:16.019> them<00:03:16.110> into<00:03:16.310> released

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
would try to put them into released

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.920 
would try to put them into released
filter<00:03:17.640> water<00:03:17.930> just<00:03:18.930> give<00:03:19.440> them<00:03:19.560> better

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
filter water just give them better

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.070 
filter water just give them better
condition<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:23.459> form<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> roots<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
condition to to form the roots the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.050 
condition to to form the roots the
regular<00:03:25.440> faucet<00:03:26.130> water<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.519> think<00:03:26.850> with<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
regular faucet water I think with the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.060 
regular faucet water I think with the
okay<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> but<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.900> might<00:03:28.049> contain<00:03:28.230> high-level

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
okay to but it might contain high-level

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.699 
okay to but it might contain high-level
chlorine<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.030> may<00:03:31.019> not<00:03:31.200> might<00:03:31.500> inhibit

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
chlorine so you may not might inhibit

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.520 
chlorine so you may not might inhibit
the<00:03:32.040> growth<00:03:32.660> that's<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:33.870> my<00:03:33.989> thought<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.410> I

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
the growth that's just my thought but I

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.490 
the growth that's just my thought but I
think<00:03:34.769> should<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:34.950> okay<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:36.299> look<00:03:37.080> at<00:03:37.200> some<00:03:37.380> of

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
think should be okay but look at some of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.350 
think should be okay but look at some of
the<00:03:38.150> every<00:03:39.150> one<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.330> them<00:03:39.540> has<00:03:40.290> roots

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
the every one of them has roots

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.449 
the every one of them has roots
I've<00:03:42.360> several<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.930> did<00:03:43.170> not<00:03:43.320> root<00:03:43.650> maybe<00:03:44.100> it

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
I've several that did not root maybe it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.210 
I've several that did not root maybe it
was<00:03:44.610> rotted<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.150> something<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.510> don't<00:03:45.570> know<00:03:45.720> but

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
was rotted or something I don't know but

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.770 
was rotted or something I don't know but
withdrawing<00:03:47.220> them<00:03:47.459> had<00:03:47.640> beautiful<00:03:48.600> roots<00:03:50.780> so

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
withdrawing them had beautiful roots so

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.110 
withdrawing them had beautiful roots so
I<00:03:52.019> think<00:03:52.200> once<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.920> has<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.430> few<00:03:53.790> more<00:03:53.940> leaves

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
I think once it has a few more leaves

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.860 
I think once it has a few more leaves
here<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:55.880> probably<00:03:56.880> probably<00:03:57.299> put

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
here and I will probably probably put

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.770 
here and I will probably probably put
them<00:03:57.930> in<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.140> pot<00:03:58.350> first<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.920> trying<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.780> grow

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
them in the pot first and trying to grow

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.560 
them in the pot first and trying to grow
them<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.110> pot<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.150> said<00:04:03.299> this<00:04:03.390> is

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
them in a pot and like I said this is

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.130 
them in a pot and like I said this is
completely<00:04:03.959> indoor<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.830> far<00:04:05.070> no<00:04:05.610> sunlight<00:04:06.140> so

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
completely indoor so far no sunlight so

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.810 
completely indoor so far no sunlight so
they<00:04:07.260> might<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.620> at<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> beginning<00:04:08.640> they

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
they might like at the beginning they

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.880 
they might like at the beginning they
might<00:04:08.970> like<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.239> shade<00:04:09.510> or<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.680> cool

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
might like the shade or in a cool

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.420 
might like the shade or in a cool
environment<00:04:11.269> so<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.420> woods<00:04:12.600> will<00:04:12.780> develop

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
environment so the woods will develop

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.749 
environment so the woods will develop
they<00:04:14.849> are<00:04:15.380> summer<00:04:16.380> vegetables<00:04:17.100> lady<00:04:17.400> they

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
they are summer vegetables lady they

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.840 
they are summer vegetables lady they
will<00:04:17.940> like<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.329> Sun<00:04:19.160> but<00:04:20.160> they<00:04:20.639> will

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
will like the Sun but they will

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.490 
will like the Sun but they will
definitely<00:04:21.830> require<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.919> lot<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.460> moisture<00:04:24.500> so

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
definitely require a lot of moisture so

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.960 
definitely require a lot of moisture so
this<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:26.580> choy<00:04:26.910> Chinese<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:28.229> Chinese<00:04:28.500> and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
this is a on choy Chinese in Chinese and
