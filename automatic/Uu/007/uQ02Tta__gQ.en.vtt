 yeah it's running out of steam a little 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.910
 good and then this fantastic thing because 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.050
 that it must be said that you have made a 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.239
 rock contest 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.620

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.560
 course is that we saw a while ago 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.610

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.470
 there yeah well not that's what we 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.090
 thought that day we would have liked 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.480
 that they leave with us and we have been to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.459
 Japan 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.800
 and then we played with two 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.989
 Japanese wheels cushions pebbles and then 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.519
 we were unanimously elected by the jury 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.290
 only as a high place ten minutes 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.090
 we played it 10 minutes 49 seconds 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.489
 with 49 seconds we were eliminated for 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.870
 49 seconds but hey it's like that at 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.160
 japan and then here and girls 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.660

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.820
 French rock'n'roll but they 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.200
 are young and she will not run you 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.180
 exit to have autographs but 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.410
 it's very healthy what's not sacred at all 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.140
 it's just an autograph 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.320

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.290
