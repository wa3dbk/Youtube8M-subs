00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really matters so I did decent benchmark

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.109 
really matters so I did decent benchmark
testing<00:01:17.130> stuff<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.060> all

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
testing stuff on this but you're all

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
testing stuff on this but you're all
very<00:01:18.360> very<00:01:18.630> similar<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.590> ever<00:01:19.830> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
very very similar and they very ever so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.050 
very very similar and they very ever so
slightly<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.549> purely<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
slightly just purely because the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.850 
slightly just purely because the
benchmarks<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.659> holla<00:01:21.869> PC<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.259> actor<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.710> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
benchmarks my holla PC was actor it's on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010 
benchmarks my holla PC was actor it's on
but<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.520> were<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:23.970> same<00:01:24.479> similar<00:01:24.869> on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
but they were very very same similar on

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
but they were very very same similar on
time<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> performed<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.299> instance<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
time I performed so for instance the

battlefield 4's we just ran through a

what<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.460> did<00:01:56.579> exactly<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.990> supposed<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
what it did exactly and it's supposed to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
what it did exactly and it's supposed to
keep<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.590> -<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.280> very<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.549> FPS<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.540> 54

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
keep that was - very very good FPS so 54

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
keep that was - very very good FPS so 54
on<00:02:01.829> battlefield<00:02:02.820> 3<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.290> 51<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.380> Diablo<00:02:04.770> 3<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
on battlefield 3 and 51 on Diablo 3 and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.540 
on battlefield 3 and 51 on Diablo 3 and
then<00:02:06.149> obviously<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> hrs<00:02:07.619> only<00:02:08.369> ever

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
then obviously on to the hrs only ever

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.910 
then obviously on to the hrs only ever
so<00:02:08.759> slightly<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.330> higher<00:02:09.810> settings<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.770> that's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
so slightly a higher settings but that's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.990 
so slightly a higher settings but that's
because<00:02:11.069> conquer<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
because conquer the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.770 
because conquer the
core<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.650> memory<00:02:13.650> caca<00:02:13.890> roughly<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.670> same<00:02:14.850> so

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
core and memory caca roughly the same so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.000 
core and memory caca roughly the same so
for<00:02:15.930> instance<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.440> year<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.890> got<00:02:17.070> 54<00:02:17.850> FPS<00:02:18.390> 1.9

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
for instance this year it got 54 FPS 1.9

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.670 
for instance this year it got 54 FPS 1.9
57<00:02:20.010> FPS<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.490> battles<00:02:20.880> free<00:02:21.270> FPS<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.470> got

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
57 FPS on battles free FPS on and it got

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.540 
57 FPS on battles free FPS on and it got
53<00:02:23.580> FPS<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.330> Diablo<00:02:24.690> 3<00:02:24.930> which<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.470> 2<00:02:25.770> FPS<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
53 FPS on Diablo 3 which is 2 FPS are so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.240 
53 FPS on Diablo 3 which is 2 FPS are so
there's<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.820> much<00:02:26.880> great<00:02:27.450> idea<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.440> as

there's not much great idea there and as

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
this thing here it was hit in our 68

degrees full load this was only hitting

degrees full load this was only hitting

at 59 degrees of full line that's almost

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.020 
at 59 degrees of full line that's almost
10<00:03:21.239> degrees<00:03:21.769> likely<00:03:22.769> lower<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.790> fact<00:03:23.970> that

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
10 degrees likely lower so the fact that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.280 
10 degrees likely lower so the fact that
you<00:03:24.180> kind<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.600> back<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.870> play<00:03:25.049> with<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
you kind of got back to play with a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.630 
you kind of got back to play with a
little<00:03:25.470> bit<00:03:25.560> more<00:03:25.709> when<00:03:25.860> I'm<00:03:25.950> cooking<00:03:26.160> you'll

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
little bit more when I'm cooking you'll

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280 
little bit more when I'm cooking you'll
be<00:03:26.790> able<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> achieve<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.269> higher<00:03:27.540> FPS<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:28.080> games

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
be able to achieve a higher FPS in games

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.350 
be able to achieve a higher FPS in games
and<00:03:28.500> stuff<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.070> obviously<00:03:29.280> I'm<00:03:29.430> gonna<00:03:29.580> do<00:03:29.730> an

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
and stuff so obviously I'm gonna do an

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.449 
and stuff so obviously I'm gonna do an
over<00:03:30.570> called<00:03:30.780> test<00:03:31.019> settings<00:03:31.470> etc<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:32.310> show

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
over called test settings etc to show

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.340 
over called test settings etc to show
you<00:03:32.519> what<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.910> get<00:03:33.420> when<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.049> fully

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you what I can get when I fully

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.530 
you what I can get when I fully
overclocked<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.920> beast<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.519> hopefully<00:03:36.480> you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
overclocked this beast and hopefully you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.170 
overclocked this beast and hopefully you
enjoy<00:03:36.810> their<00:03:36.989> later<00:03:37.350> date<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.820> pretty<00:03:39.090> much

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
enjoy their later date but pretty much

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.270 
enjoy their later date but pretty much
guys<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.870> pretty<00:03:40.049> much<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.470> basically

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
guys that is pretty much it so basically

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.610 
guys that is pretty much it so basically
I've<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:41.760> finger<00:03:41.910> insert<00:03:42.480> well<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.380> last

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
I've on this finger insert well one last

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.650 
I've on this finger insert well one last
thing<00:03:43.829> as<00:03:43.950> well<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.760> thing<00:03:45.000> runs<00:03:45.269> much

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
thing as well is this thing runs much

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.020 
thing as well is this thing runs much
much<00:03:46.110> quieter<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.280> has<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> very<00:03:47.700> kind<00:03:47.880> of

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
much quieter and it has a very kind of

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.259 
much quieter and it has a very kind of
cooler<00:03:48.450> fan<00:03:49.049> design<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:50.070> there<00:03:50.269> where

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
cooler fan design in there where

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.580 
cooler fan design in there where
basically<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.690> spins<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.140> HUD<00:03:52.260> builds<00:03:52.500> that

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
basically it spins and HUD builds that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.810 
basically it spins and HUD builds that
pressure<00:03:52.799> around<00:03:52.950> this<00:03:53.070> bit<00:03:53.280> here<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.519> shoots

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
pressure around this bit here and shoots

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.520 
pressure around this bit here and shoots
it<00:03:53.940> out<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> case<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.720> obviously<00:03:54.959> once<00:03:55.260> again

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
it out the case so obviously once again

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
it out the case so obviously once again
it's<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:55.860> actually<00:03:56.280> keeping<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.060> hot<00:03:57.209> air<00:03:57.360> in

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
it's not actually keeping the hot air in

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.850 
it's not actually keeping the hot air in
the<00:03:57.570> case<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.930> shoots<00:03:58.049> all<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.380> hot<00:03:58.560> air<00:03:58.590> out

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
the case it shoots all the hot air out

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.080 
the case it shoots all the hot air out
of<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.250> case<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.579> pretty<00:03:59.850> sure<00:03:59.910> place

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
of the case of this pretty sure place

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.090 
of the case of this pretty sure place
after<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> power<00:04:00.989> cut<00:04:01.230> class<00:04:01.440> shoots<00:04:01.739> out<00:04:01.890> at

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
after the power cut class shoots out at

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.190 
after the power cut class shoots out at
all<00:04:02.220> angles<00:04:02.610> left<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.030> watts<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.720> lot<00:04:04.140> of

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
all angles left and watts is a lot of

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.380 
all angles left and watts is a lot of
the<00:04:04.260> hot<00:04:04.410> air<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.709> going<00:04:04.920> back<00:04:05.220> inside<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
the hot air is going back inside of the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.140 
the hot air is going back inside of the
case<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:07.680> obviously<00:04:08.010> ain't<00:04:08.220> down<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.549> this<00:04:08.850> is

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
case but obviously ain't down so this is

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.750 
case but obviously ain't down so this is
the<00:04:09.239> fact<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.019> much<00:04:10.350> bigger<00:04:10.760> look

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
the fact that it is so much bigger look

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.289 
the fact that it is so much bigger look
at<00:04:11.850> la<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:13.489> there's<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.579> fair<00:04:14.940> amount<00:04:15.060> of

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
at la that is there's a fair amount of

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.090 
at la that is there's a fair amount of
work<00:04:15.480> just<00:04:15.840> there<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.169> go<00:04:16.290> on<00:04:16.380> right<00:04:16.560> on<00:04:16.709> top<00:04:17.070> of

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
work just there to go on right on top of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.620 
work just there to go on right on top of
that<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:17.820> friends<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.419> hold<00:04:18.600> that

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
that but friends if I just hold that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.979 
that but friends if I just hold that
above<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.959> you'll<00:04:19.260> see<00:04:20.450> there's<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.570> lot<00:04:21.810> lot

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
above it you'll see there's a lot lot

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.060 
above it you'll see there's a lot lot
more<00:04:22.020> in<00:04:22.320> there<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.590> unless<00:04:22.740> you've<00:04:22.919> got<00:04:23.010> a

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
more in there so unless you've got a

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.890 
more in there so unless you've got a
pretty<00:04:23.280> big<00:04:23.430> case<00:04:23.669> that's<00:04:24.360> probably<00:04:24.630> gonna<00:04:24.810> be

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
pretty big case that's probably gonna be

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.580 
pretty big case that's probably gonna be
only<00:04:25.110> own

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
only own

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.080 
only own
I<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:26.070> fit<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.340> one<00:04:26.460> case<00:04:26.669> which<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:26.940> very

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
I just fit in one case which is very

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.870 
I just fit in one case which is very
lucky<00:04:27.480> idea<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.780> quite<00:04:27.990> big<00:04:28.199> year<00:04:28.880> mr.
