a<00:01:30.600> side<00:01:31.170> effect<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.740> supposed<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
a side effect it's supposed to be

belt<00:01:36.960> undone<00:01:37.890> by<00:01:38.189> them<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.990> could<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
belt undone by them so it could be that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
belt undone by them so it could be that
there<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> lack<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> carbs<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there could be the lack of carbs so I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
there could be the lack of carbs so I
keep<00:01:42.750> popping<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> sweet<00:01:43.380> potatoes<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.549> know
