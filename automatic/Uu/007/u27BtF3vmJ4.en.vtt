personally am a iTunes Match subscribers
so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.399> guess<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.969> will<00:00:48.030> kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> be

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so I guess that will kind of be

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
so I guess that will kind of be
beneficial<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:48.989> me<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.340> know<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
beneficial for me but I don't know I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
beneficial for me but I don't know I
kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:50.850> Spotify<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.719> anyways<00:00:52.379> now

kind of use Spotify now but anyways now

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
making this video well the reason why

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.150 
making this video well the reason why
that<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.770> jailbreak

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
