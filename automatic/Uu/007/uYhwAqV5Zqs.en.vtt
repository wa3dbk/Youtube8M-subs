00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.620
 hello spoken to market this constantino 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.100
 we are going to talk about the sun 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.920
 what is one of the first things that 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.710
 we have named as free that the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.540
 nature gives us free then there's 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.540
 many benefits of sunbathing 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.150
 in this video we are going to talk about the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.560
 benefits to sunbath naked 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.669
 from us so you can notice let's say 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.880
 keeps the sun everywhere 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880
 body 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.870
 the first benefit of sunbathing 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.080
 is that it strengthens the bones all the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.180
 vitamin D that is synthesized taking the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.160
 sun is essential for the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.840
 bone mineralization and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.030
 teeth 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.310
 the powerful rays of the sun take care 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.310
 to activate and activate this vitamin 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.090
 also another benefit is that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.640
 improves the skin 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.880
 solar radiation helps to prevent and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.759
 handle acne and in severe cases like 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.069
 psoriasis the sun's rays are 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.060
 determinants to help eliminate 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.060
 this sickness 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.330
 another one of the things that helps make the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 sun is to improve defenses 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.990
 the sun can increase the number of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.480
 white blood cells in their two lines both 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.220
 in neutrophils as lymphocytes 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.130
 since these make up the first 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 defense squad of the organism 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.490
 if we take the sun we increase our 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 defenses 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.290
 Grace decreases 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.070
 cholesterol levels are reduced in 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.480
 people during summers light 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.030
 solar is fundamental to metabolize what 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.210
 besides the people who do more 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.600
 exercise when the day is bright or 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.600
 loneliness 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.360
 also sunbathing improves the pressure 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.430
 arterial 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.890
 when the arteries of the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.980
 skin the amount of blood is reduced 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.310
 concentrated in the organs and this goes down 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.450
 blood pressure what is ideal for 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.220
 the hypertensive 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.360
 it also decreases our pressure 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360
 arterial sunbathing 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.770
 I will take this the best the heart 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.080
 the heart contracts by action of the 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.340
 calcium when it is insufficient 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.230
 when insufficient calcium 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.620
 hormones for terrorists take it from 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.780
 the bones to give 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.629
 but when a person suns 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.090
 decreases hormone levels that 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.580
 they remove the calcium from the bones so 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.659
 so much improves the heart and improves 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.659
 your times 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.390
 improves sex life sunbathing 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.550
 improves sex life 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.150
 to those who think that their libido rises 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.890
 in summer the ska of reason arc the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.750
 Sun rays also increase 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.410
 slightly testosterone levels 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.580
 in men and in women it increases 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.840
 the sexual desire 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.840
 so to sunbathe 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.360
 decreases drowsiness 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.740
 ultraviolet rays regulate the 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.270
 hormone melatonin production 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.970
 helps define sleep cycles 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.670
 sunlight reduces its levels what 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.670
 helps you feel more awake 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.430
 and also sunbathing improves our 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.129
 mood 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.150
 since the sun's radiation promotes 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.430
 synthesis 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.340
 of serotonin a substance 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.340
 related to well-being and that 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.390
 It also helps regulate sleep and even 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.390
 sexual behavior 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.910
 and also sunbathe avoid the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.430
 tumors 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.060
 the sun promotes natural protection 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.070
 in front of certain cancers apparently its 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.880
 action is direct on some cells 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.130
 and by effect of vitamin d who 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.980
 they sunbathe on a regular basis they have a 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.000
 lower incidence of breast cancer and 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.580
 colon 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.320
 so why not sunbathe if 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.320
 it also prevents us from cancer 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:47.070
 then the formula that I recommend for 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.950
 sunbathing is sunbathing so 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.830
 less half an hour a day whenever it is 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.170
 Sunny obviously 15 minutes per each 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.960
 side or 15 minutes face down 15 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.009
 minutes face up and if possible 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.779
 naked or in a bathing suit 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:08.569
 you have an open wound let's say the 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.789
 skin does not expose it to the sun since the sun 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.960
 can generate a spot in this part 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.480
 of the skin 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.820
 then to sunbathe 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.470
 since the sun besides that can 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.470
 keeps us in effect 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.640
