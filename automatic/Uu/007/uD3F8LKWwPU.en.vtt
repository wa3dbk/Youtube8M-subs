00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.090
 at least six thousand clandestine flights take place every year in space 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:05.320
 brazilian air 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.950
 good part about the gigantic amazon valley has been adapting since 1998 to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.950
 to curb this traffic but until three and a half years ago the lack of a law 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.920
 authorizing the killing of clandestine airplanes allowed for all types of abuse 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.609
 in 2002 for example the aircraft fighter intercepted this small 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.079
 plane that was flying over goias crammed with cocaine 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.859
 at the time of the interception of two traffickers father and son an aircraft that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.489
 another on land caught the following dialogue picked up by the federal police 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990
 ex 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.870
 clear 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.469
 against araraquara 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.469
 O 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.220
 carla 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.830
 minutes later realizing that the fab pilot did not have to do 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.830
 the mood of the traffickers changes the krona 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.850
 range 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.330
 wrong of course 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.299
 today the fighters of the readiness fab in old port good view and big field 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.729
 has legal permission to shoot down planes used for the practice of crimes 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 these bars are subordinate to the complex surveillance system that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.030
 the other armed forces' and works closely with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.120
 federal police 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.130
 for the military of the aeronautics as if the country were permanently 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.420
 in a state of war defense him anywhere in the world 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.180
 it has to function exactly like all-time operational readiness with 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.100
 this is your fur actions with the air defense alert aircraft 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.600
 operating normally any time of day or night without any restrictions 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.970
 our team was invited to participate in a 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.880
 The starting point was the large field air base in the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.549
 Southern thick mine had the track follow in the case of late 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.070
 and I'm going on the plane the target 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.270
 this temperamental t25 with more than 30 years of services to the motherland 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.279
 if every councilor 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 he took her foot 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.069
 such as 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.069
 the driver was on the fourth attempt 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.509
 while renato if the folder 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.929
 the gear of the air defense system begins to run January 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.779
 on the radar screen at the military operations center of Curitiba. 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.699
 flight appears suspicious 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:32.939
 the triumph of 3-1 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.469
 the military controllers 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.389
 trying unsuccessfully to identify the plane 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.389
 the coordination of takeoff in the case of the jury 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.469
 saleh and your success that is succeeding 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:45.629
 this reaction 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.349
 endears sears 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.420
 we did two good results already in the air only then the pilot receives the 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.419
 first decisions to reduce poverty 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.589
 flour house interceta trajectory of our airplane 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.519
 first I'm going after a little below to not be noticed 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.519
 then appeared there 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.869
 the case where on board the aircraft at 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:30.839
 if the suspects persist he is obliged to land and is escorted to 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.319
 the head of the track 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.570
 if you refuse 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.499
 a warning shot fired at the ammunition the plane carries 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.659
 he takes a few tracer bullets that we call her when she is fired 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.109
 sky mine 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.249
 and visually the intercepted pilot pilot of the aircraft was intercepted 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.459
 it can come that projects are being studied the next step which is the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.479
 destruction of the aircraft in flight 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.080
 the order has to be given directly by the commander of the aeronautics 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.860
 because the regulation of the team 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.940
 it was not necessary to apply any kind of fanfare warning what all 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.560
 students attending to our requests the afternoon masters holding 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.420
 although it is possible to patrol 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.790
 all Brazilian airspace at least one effect is already possible 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.749
 prove 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.910
 the traffic that was loosened by the skies of the country now has to find routes 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.090
 overland alternatives 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.250
