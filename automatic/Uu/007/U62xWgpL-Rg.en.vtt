to turn three and your break point is
right<00:01:37.980> at<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.280> speed<00:01:38.850> under<00:01:39.000> sign<00:01:39.330> let's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
right at the speed under sign let's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
right at the speed under sign let's
cross<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.230> top<00:01:40.440> here<00:01:42.230> let<00:01:43.230> off<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.590> brakes

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.850 
cross the top here let off the brakes
and<00:01:44.730> get<00:01:45.690> back<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> accelerator<00:01:46.410> as

and get back on the accelerator as

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.410 
and get back on the accelerator as
quickly<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.430> possible<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.270> going

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
quickly as possible because that's going

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.580 
quickly as possible because that's going
to<00:01:48.510> give<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.750> most<00:01:48.840> speed<00:01:49.230> coming<00:01:49.500> down

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
to give you the most speed coming down
