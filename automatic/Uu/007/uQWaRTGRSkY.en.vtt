two<00:01:02.489> loopholes<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> top<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.320> looks<00:01:04.530> like

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
two loopholes in the top it looks like

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
two loopholes in the top it looks like
you<00:01:04.920> remove<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.820> pack<00:01:06.119> strapped<00:01:06.470> thread<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
through the top down to the bottom and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
through the top down to the bottom and
then<00:01:10.020> there's<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> solid<00:01:11.310> piece<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.850> nylon

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
then there's you solid piece of so nylon

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
then there's you solid piece of so nylon
here<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> keeps<00:01:12.840> water<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.409> entering<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
here that keeps water from entering the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.330 
here that keeps water from entering the
pack<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.420> design<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.159> too<00:01:17.310> much

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
pack this design I don't like too much

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.030 
pack this design I don't like too much
just<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.390> there's<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.259> much<00:01:19.409> involved

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just because there's too much involved

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.310 
just because there's too much involved
with<00:01:20.220> getting<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.360> set<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.020> what

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
with getting it set up and I think what

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.600 
with getting it set up and I think what
it's<00:01:22.439> raining<00:01:22.770> last<00:01:22.979> thing<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this that's all of that so I don't think

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.570 
this that's all of that so I don't think
we're<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.369> with

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
we're going to go with

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.670 
we're going to go with
this<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.300> again<00:01:27.540> i<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.750> no<00:01:27.930> proof<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this one but again i have no proof the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
this one but again i have no proof the
second<00:01:29.040> design<00:01:29.250> seems<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.760> lot<00:01:29.880> better<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.330> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
