ten inch rear and then we do a twelve
inch<00:00:53.399> front<00:00:53.850> which<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.600> makes<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:55.050> handle

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
inch front which which makes them handle

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.170 
inch front which which makes them handle
a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.649> better<00:00:55.949> than<00:00:56.219> stock<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a lot better than stock just because it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
a lot better than stock just because it
kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> choppers<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.680> bit

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
