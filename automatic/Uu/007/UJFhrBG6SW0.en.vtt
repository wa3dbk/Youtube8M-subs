string<00:03:19.810> from<00:03:20.810> there<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.110> go<00:03:21.230> down<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.440> this

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
string from there you go down to this

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.309 
string from there you go down to this
ISA<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.400> mean<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.850> suspended<00:03:23.600> second<00:03:24.050> I<00:03:24.110> think

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
ISA I mean a suspended second I think

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.940 
ISA I mean a suspended second I think
it's<00:03:25.250> us<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.269> or<00:03:26.450> such<00:03:26.780> force<00:03:27.080> almost<00:03:27.560> calling

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
it's us to or such force almost calling

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.090 
it's us to or such force almost calling
out<00:03:28.130> on<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:29.000> um<00:03:29.319> it's<00:03:30.319> just<00:03:30.440> two<00:03:30.950> fingers

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
out on that but um it's just two fingers

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.050 
out on that but um it's just two fingers
right<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:31.819> it's<00:03:32.780> open<00:03:33.079> a<00:03:34.329> 22<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:36.350> then<00:03:36.470> open

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
right here it's open a 22 and then open

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.850 
right here it's open a 22 and then open
so<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:38.209> kind<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.540> normal<00:03:38.840> egg<00:03:39.019> if<00:03:39.650> you

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
so it's kind of like a normal egg if you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.580 
so it's kind of like a normal egg if you
just<00:03:40.010> drop<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.489> ring<00:03:40.910> finger<00:03:41.260> drop<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.440> B

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
just drop the ring finger drop the B

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.110 
just drop the ring finger drop the B
string

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
string

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.520 
string
let<00:03:45.049> me<00:03:45.110> go<00:03:45.260> back<00:03:45.409> to<00:03:45.440> e<00:03:47.680> especially<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:50.530> faculty

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
let me go back to e especially a faculty

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.180 
let me go back to e especially a faculty
and<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.900> last<00:03:54.110> quarter<00:03:54.349> this<00:03:54.470> progression<00:03:54.860> is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
and the last quarter this progression is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.869 
and the last quarter this progression is
up<00:03:55.730> here<00:03:56.000> it's<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:56.989> b-minor<00:03:57.920> just<00:03:58.430> if<00:03:58.760> you

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
up here it's like a b-minor just if you

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.850 
up here it's like a b-minor just if you
just<00:03:58.909> take<00:03:59.269> off<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.810> middle<00:04:00.440> finger<00:04:00.680> there

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
just take off the middle finger there

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.759 
just take off the middle finger there
and<00:04:01.269> leave<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.450> part<00:04:02.629> open<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.250> it's<00:04:04.459> like

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
and leave that part open so it's like

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.199 
and leave that part open so it's like
it's<00:04:06.769> like<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.950> minor<00:04:07.159> chord<00:04:07.459> or<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.000> power

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
it's like a minor chord or like a power

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.690 
it's like a minor chord or like a power
cord<00:04:08.450> really<00:04:08.659> but<00:04:09.250> just<00:04:10.250> leave<00:04:10.519> everything

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
cord really but just leave everything

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.390 
cord really but just leave everything
open<00:04:10.970> there<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.840> sound<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.890> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
open there and you sound like that and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.779 
open there and you sound like that and
again<00:04:14.360> that's<00:04:14.510> just<00:04:14.659> borrowing<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.789> second

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
again that's just borrowing the second

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.930 
again that's just borrowing the second
fret<00:04:16.940> from<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.769> string<00:04:18.769> down<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.220> then<00:04:19.789> you

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
fret from the a string down and then you

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.180 
fret from the a string down and then you
just<00:04:20.090> put<00:04:20.209> your<00:04:20.329> ring<00:04:21.109> finger<00:04:21.260> pinky<00:04:21.590> on<00:04:21.949> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
just put your ring finger pinky on the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.790 
just put your ring finger pinky on the
fourth<00:04:22.430> fret<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:22.930> D<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.470> g-strings<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
fourth fret of the D and g-strings and

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.370 
fourth fret of the D and g-strings and
those<00:04:28.699> are<00:04:28.820> all<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.120> chords<00:04:29.419> of<00:04:29.539> the<00:04:29.630> song<00:04:29.810> so

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
those are all the chords of the song so

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.110 
those are all the chords of the song so
you<00:04:30.440> use<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.310> entire<00:04:31.520> song<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:31.850> can<00:04:31.970> play

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
you use the entire song you can play

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.550 
you use the entire song you can play
those<00:04:32.300> chords<00:04:32.510> just<00:04:32.810> maybe<00:04:32.990> like<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.289> different

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
those chords just maybe like a different

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.189 
those chords just maybe like a different
progression<00:04:34.039> so<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.570> verse<00:04:35.720> sounds<00:04:36.139> like

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
progression so the verse sounds like

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:45.290 
progression so the verse sounds like
that

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:56.840 

you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.860 

and<00:04:57.850> that's<00:04:58.090> when<00:04:58.270> you're<00:04:58.390> going<00:04:58.480> into<00:04:58.720> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
and that's when you're going into the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.570 
and that's when you're going into the
chorus<00:04:59.230> and<00:04:59.890> the<00:04:59.950> course<00:05:00.160> is<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.400> three

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
chorus and the course is just three

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.330 
chorus and the course is just three
chords<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:00.940> it's<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.050> c-sharp<00:05:02.500> minor<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:06.250> the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
chords and it's the c-sharp minor to the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.760 
chords and it's the c-sharp minor to the
B<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.980> then<00:05:09.280> eat<00:05:10.080> then<00:05:11.080> back<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.650> bait

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
B and then eat then back to the bait

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.710 
B and then eat then back to the bait
then<00:05:14.770> nice<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.070> see<00:05:15.250> minors<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:16.480> it's<00:05:16.600> really

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
then nice to see minors so it's really

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.750 
then nice to see minors so it's really
just<00:05:16.810> like<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.050> circle<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.560> really<00:05:18.100> simple

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
just like a circle of really simple

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.240 
just like a circle of really simple
chords<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.650> that's<00:05:20.650> pretty<00:05:20.830> much<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:21.040> whole

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
chords and that's pretty much the whole

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:44.200 
chords and that's pretty much the whole
song<00:05:21.780> hero

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.580 

and<00:05:45.210> that's<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.480> whole<00:05:45.600> song<00:05:45.780> so<00:05:46.410> have<00:05:46.560> fun
