00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 you people are parking and Japan is getting 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.549
 find point of the video on fifa 13 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.720
 so today we are not on fifa 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.179
 ultimate team but as I wanted to say 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.660
 it's a reserved channel will show so 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.360
 today it will be career mode 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.430
 I decided to start a new 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.980
 series in career mode so this will be a 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.680
 a career that I will start with 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.640
 the club fc as they are called game 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.540
 with the Monaco club 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.950
 i think i started monaco 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.210
 because there is no comment live 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.610
 because I had to do some 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.110
 montages and all so even if I wanted 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.900
 tell you so this will be a career of 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.879
 player therefore to eat a pro eto'o and 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.680
 so I'm still very very very 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.300
 bad in editing so if it lacks 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.379
 goals or important stuff I'm 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.000
 really sorry but I'm really 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.620
 no one, I try to do as much as I can 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 for you but I really can not 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.530
 really really very very bad at 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.210
 youtube editing even on sony vegas 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.620
 so if there are some who do not know 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.059
 badly and ben I like that you me 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.699
 leave a message that you give your 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.640
 kayes for private message so here's for 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.549
 she I think I started monaco 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.450
 wait I'm watching so I 'm going to them 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.799
 take as a voice so I 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.119
 started in Monaco so hard 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.640
 international for the whole season 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.299
 hard period 4 minutes removed from 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.180
 financial figures 85% it will be the euro the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.010
 motto that we do not care a bit 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.030
 on the other hand I think I did not put the 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.369
 competition 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.390
 Champions League yeah that's bah 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.110
 I'm not going to league champions 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.909
 for the first season 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.950
 because frankly it was going to be a 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.409
 little too hard since it's already 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.080
 the international with a pro who who 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.900
 starts at 68 so the red command 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.990
 this video well he already has 80 even 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.549
 not no 80 I think he already has 74 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.080
 stuff like that so you'll see in 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.799
 is in the next and then the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.290
 next episodes you're going to 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.250
 see that it will frankly be 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.619
 go see that I 'm going to put a lot 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.130
 of goals per game I do not know why 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.840
 frankly I do not know I did not put the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.880
 sliders the sliders actually is the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.500
 things like that that allow me to 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.060
 boost our players to run 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.560
 faster and where you will see in the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.330
 goals an airlock banks called slider 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.100
 otherwise the strikes start at 100 km / h 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.880
 and everything but I mark 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.420
 a lot of goals 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.310
 so here I go a little spoiler but 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.380
 I've already shot the second episode 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.060
 and I'm already 10 goals in 5 matches 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.260
 as honestly I hope you 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.160
 do not go with it but 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.380
 it's not my fault 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.660
 either I am super strong or 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.010
 I do not know but I did not put the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.870
 sliders I put no cheat 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 so here I made a pro a it's 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.230
 simple I say it looks a bit like me 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.269
 just because there is the cup after I 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.840
 I do not care about the body so I made myself 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:47.209
 at my height so one but 95 for 80 kg 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.549
 even if I do not do 80 kg so so many 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.350
 two fists yeah so relegated 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.519
 excuse me I had a small break 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.730
 because someone to go home 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.560
 me 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.200
 So as I told you I aï 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.130
 made to my size so a guy 95 jamie 90 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.500
 kg to make the measurements 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.150
 of ibrahimovic but even if I do not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.910
 90 kg in the street a little what that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.110
 would be a little big so 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.630
 I put my measurements and everything so 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.820
 I started at the monaco ace and you 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.180
 go see that I'm going directly loaned 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.210
 from the first day and that bah I'm going 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.920
 I will be loaned so the editing is 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.550
 very badly done I apologize again 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.550
 but I will be loaned to the club gazelec 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.890
 I do not know which city I believe in 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.850
 ajaccio yes here ajaccio I lent to the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.260
 Gazelec of Ajaccio 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.850
 so I thought it was a very 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.830
 bad club in league 2 but not actually 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.260
 they are really strong you will see 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 that he dives makes good calls where 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.340
 they make you good passes from 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.260
 good early hit it's really huge 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.560
 so I hope this series you go 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.720
 well liked so the title to the red 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.770
 comment I have not found yet 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.810
 I will see if you have ideas 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.510
 of titles if you see that there is no 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.460
 title in this session in front of this high school 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.350
 3 excuse me in this response 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.880
 this episode and well proposed month of 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.680
 titles I do not mind you see there 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.110
 directly see offer loan for 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.980
 gazélec ajaccio so bah I 'm going 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.980
 accept it directly 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.720
 even though I get paid very little bit 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.790
 expensive for a footballer 750 euros per 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.530
 week it's not huge but you're good 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.500
 like that I will play every game 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.209
 because in Monaco and Ben already there 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.940
 big players in attack so I can not 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.919
 to play too much here I have however I had 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.300
 a bug the aca directly skip the match 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.640
 so we did not see the opponent but hey 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.440
 I play against auxerre the concert was going 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.440
 the second best of the ranking of 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.950
 league 2 already in the first match as 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.270
 you see there directly bass and me 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.740
 I did not do anything but it's 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.850
 me who mouths harvesting the benign who 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.940
 we are made a goal 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.160
 I have my goals for the series 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.480
 it will be to have the golden shoe for 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.139
 this season it will be to have the shoe 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.759
 of gold and 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.060
 that's all and for the rest of the 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.060
 series I will try to have his sentence 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.520
 I will try to have 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.710
 two to be transferred to a big club 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.720
 like manchester united manchester city 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.840
 barça real or something else 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.240
 in any case a big club via Kiev 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.850
 rather forge in this one or like that 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.100
 here you are seeing second half penalty 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.470
 I really have a lot of luck so 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.030
 dropped the montage for the first episode 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.050
 and not badly done it lacks any bouquet 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.340
 everything but in the second he goes in 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.850
 miss a lot I'm really 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.889
 sorry then this is it's the end of the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.720
 video there you see that I have some very 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.650
 good match notes I was elected man 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.479
 of the match I made 18 2 goals 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.970
 so I have a score of 9 3 so that's 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.740
 really very well so ben me I'm going 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.700
 to say hi to all of you 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.460
