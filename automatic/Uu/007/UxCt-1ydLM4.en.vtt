00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.280 

guess<00:01:00.040> when<00:01:00.250> we<00:01:00.280> had<00:01:00.579> this<00:01:00.790> uniform<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.930> that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
guess when we had this uniform that that

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.469 
guess when we had this uniform that that
was<00:01:02.500> very<00:01:02.739> different<00:01:03.040> for<00:01:03.430> Hawaii<00:01:03.760> that

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
was very different for Hawaii that

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.389 
was very different for Hawaii that
didn't<00:01:04.750> seem<00:01:04.869> like<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> Hawaii<00:01:05.469> design<00:01:05.920> but<00:01:06.280> it

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
didn't seem like a Hawaii design but it

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.630 
didn't seem like a Hawaii design but it
was<00:01:06.520> very<00:01:06.899> new

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
was very new

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
was very new
when<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.390> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.660> fit<00:01:09.900> today<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.470> far

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
when that would kind of fit today as far

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.090 
when that would kind of fit today as far
as<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> print<00:01:11.160> on<00:01:11.280> things<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.920> well<00:01:13.920> the
