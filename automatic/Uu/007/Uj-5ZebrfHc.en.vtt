 I greet everyone from Biryuliovo 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 lovers pencil case pencil 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.210
 amani stylus filov sympathizers and so 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.490
 Further 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 today on the channel i would like to tell 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.369
 about your new pencil for everyday 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.010
 wearing use and now i'm 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 I use this old proven 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.140
 time graph gear 500 with a thickness 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.090
 slate pencil 0 5 mm well, those who have long 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.110
 engaged in pencils of course can 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 declare that any verified 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.129
 For decades Kokhinorovsky pencil 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 with any hardness but with 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.260
 professional sharpening will bend this 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 count gear for the belt but I'm part they will 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.460
 right but the graph hera is still 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.520
 slightly different level another philosophy 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 but so on but let's flounder 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.120
 sengor such a box arrived to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.190
 me today in the sun our 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.320
 dupes 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:16.080
 so unpacking I will do like this 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.909
 deluxe painting cutter though usually 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.890
 I use luxury military 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 but about knives for sharpening and for 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.119
 I will probably tell you anboxing separately 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.570
 other videos of yours 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.570
 unpacking 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:54.220
 a lot of paper 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:58.860
 here so here is fashionable 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 box and internal lies already 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:09.810
 serious enough pencil firm 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 pencil 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:23.280
 so here it looks like a pencil of course 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.640
 firm pencil sounds like oil oily 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:33.170
 but this firm is one of 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:37.340
 the oldest switzerland and this is us a pencil and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.959
 Van Hall from the varius collection 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.680
 so distinctive feature of this pencil 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.680
 Well, let's probably hide you 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.070
 it is a distinctive feature that he 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.240
 silver 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:13.980
 rhodium plated serious nice on 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.490
 touch the thing here is this rough surface 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:22.710
 It looks like a small roll in this corporate 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:26.200
 ornament and van hall feeder 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.380
 rod classic all known 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.970
 mechanical pencils push bottom 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.260
 what can i say about this pencil well 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 snapshot is quite possible to go to meetings 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.690
 meetings with colleagues there with leadership 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.520
 middle managers probably can confidently 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.130
 feel at meetings with a partner 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:51.070
 or competitors there but so i think that 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:55.360
 go to top management I would with 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.310
 it poosteregsya there still course 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.340
 need a more thoughtful approach and 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.990
 preparation well and perhaps it was more appropriate 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.300
 would choose for such cases 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.730
 rather stochny and to the middle kokhinor 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.850
 medium hardness can even be 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.270
 somewhat nervous of the mountain zone he will 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.270
 far more appropriate in such cases 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.670
 well, or even abandon the pencil well 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.620
 on this probably all peace sharpen 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.680
 pencils in a meeting see you on 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.680
