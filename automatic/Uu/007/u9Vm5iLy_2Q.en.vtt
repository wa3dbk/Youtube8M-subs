00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 we know today there is of me 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.379
 tutorial my first and therefore please 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 I'm not so critical of you 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:17.420
 to be or to be near and to have 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:24.109
 1 I have everything very simple and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:27.330
 once a golden book leaked 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:38.210
 it is already on you now make you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:42.239
 first a nice yes then will go through 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.469
 so you have this hairband with it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.270
 your hair develops it needs a 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 bit of dexterity but that is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 actually done pretty fast 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.210
 especially if you have a herring and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 the glass does not want to lie in the head 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 do not want to lay 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.420
 Everybody knows that, I think so too 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:09.270
 a few guys but I do not think so 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 good variant for you have the celebration 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.150
 I do not know why that sucks 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.150
 me totally 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.820
 I explained that understandably 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.520
 Sunshine according to the motto of the boy 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.750
 Studying gives something forgotten 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.790
 on the other hand we do something now and that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.210
 first time but again it does not smell 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.210
 make 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 important is this lamp request 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.780
 is the machine richard you guys 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.780
 barbie pence here i have my pillow 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:53.050
 plugged in you will find all that something 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.280
 one bothers you in your head six so me 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.080
 I'm now just under three minutes with the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.020
 video here and if you are pretty much there 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.400
 is long and does not hang around you and 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.959
 has to show someone 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 then of course you are still fast 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:12.750
 we have to look like we do that for you 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.750
 hidden 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.090
 that's how the leisure time house finds it 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.090
 beautiful noble 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:47.300
 yes it has not become so chic now 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.250
 I think I can get out a bit 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.250
 Here I have a little to a few too 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:07.740
 a few hairs I do not know how to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:13.170
 side vertex variation the whole 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:15.600
 that really happened in the same way 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.220
 a bit of a summery find 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:29.010
 I ask her if I michael here 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:33.150
 schmidt is all three have and am 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.430
 his hairstyle could stop too 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.070
 super quick dissolve what I can 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.020
 it is possible that he is in wet hair 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.910
 I can not do it though 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:49.410
 Slaughtering is not to be had by Socrates 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.990
 white hair and if I do what you do 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.610
 and that's the regular thing around the im 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.830
 hair then developed can you naturally 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.910
 also generate a few waves when the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:08.070
 then you can dry your hair 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:10.380
 yes actually continue monza otherwise there 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.000
 made and the whole day in it 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.230
 let lots of great rumrennt and then 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.580
 water at celebrations 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.840
 and when the bell can not hear 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.180
 you do not exactly impress that 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:28.110
 and nobody notices that her hair is full 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:32.100
 problem i actually had i have now 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:36.450
 just go out and I hope you 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.310
 I like this tutorial now 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.710
 that has a little something from the Middle Ages 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:51.730
 i have ill 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:53.920
 Also the audience as I would say 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.180
 back makes me very happy that 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.180
