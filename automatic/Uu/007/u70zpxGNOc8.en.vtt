okay<00:00:00.719> so<00:00:00.780> what<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.829> do<00:00:01.949> now<00:00:02.159> is

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:02.929 
okay so what I'm going to do now is

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.480 
okay so what I'm going to do now is
build<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.500> drawing<00:00:04.740> create<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.279> more

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
build on this drawing create a more

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.629 
build on this drawing create a more
solid<00:00:06.060> impression<00:00:07.280> primarily<00:00:08.280> through<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
solid impression primarily through the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.390 
solid impression primarily through the
shadows<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.679> you're<00:00:10.679> going<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> develop<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
shadows and you're going to develop the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.030 
shadows and you're going to develop the
lights<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.000> darks<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:13.830> using

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
lights and darks here you know using

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.570 
lights and darks here you know using
just<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.519> simple<00:00:15.199> hatching<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.070> critical

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
just a simple hatching but the critical

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.790 
just a simple hatching but the critical
thing<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:18.000> maintaining<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.050> gesture<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
thing is maintaining this gesture and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.480 
thing is maintaining this gesture and
not<00:00:20.900> diluting<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> effect<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.650> whatever

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
not diluting the effect of whatever

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390 
not diluting the effect of whatever
force<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> drawing<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:25.400> packing

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
force we have in the drawing by packing

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
force we have in the drawing by packing
on<00:00:26.580> information<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> want<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:28.500> sure

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
on information so I want to make sure

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.310 
on information so I want to make sure
everything<00:00:29.570> all<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> information<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.289> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
everything all the information that I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.150 
everything all the information that I
put<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:32.279> enhances<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.590> gesture<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
put on here enhances the the gesture and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
put on here enhances the the gesture and
doesn't<00:00:35.460> detract<00:00:35.730> from<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.149> okay<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:36.930> ready<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
doesn't detract from it okay so ready to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.170 
doesn't detract from it okay so ready to
go<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.219> I'm<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.730> back<00:00:38.940> into

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
go here I'm going to go right back into

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
go here I'm going to go right back into
that<00:00:39.270> shoulder<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.989> shoulder<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.739> sort<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that shoulder that shoulder is sort of

that shoulder that shoulder is sort of
my<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.940> little<00:00:42.200> beacon<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.800> main

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
my my little beacon that I use that main

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.700 
my my little beacon that I use that main
point<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.420> seems<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.870> I've<00:00:46.020> gone<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.410> from

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
point it seems that I've gone there from

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
point it seems that I've gone there from
the<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:47.039> beginning<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.110> rip

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the very beginning and I'm going to rip

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
the very beginning and I'm going to rip
right<00:00:49.590> down<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.760> ridge<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.590> body<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.309> as

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
right down the ridge on the body and as

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
right down the ridge on the body and as
we<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.809> explains<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> anatomies

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we do that it explains the anatomies

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
we do that it explains the anatomies
explains<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:56.910> specific<00:00:57.510> things<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.140> know

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this is the teres major you don't need

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
this is the teres major you don't need
to<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> need<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> know

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
have to learn to see all of these little

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
have to learn to see all of these little
things<00:01:09.200> little<00:01:10.200> adjustments<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> turns<00:01:11.280> on

the<00:01:11.640> body<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.119> we're<00:01:12.270> moving<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> lat

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the body here we're moving on to the lat

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.810 
the body here we're moving on to the lat
but<00:01:13.650> again<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.100> call<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> anything<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
but again you can call that anything you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.499 
but again you can call that anything you
want<00:01:15.030> long<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.400> has

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
want long as you see that it has

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.990 
want long as you see that it has
structure<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.930> movement<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> okay<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.790> as

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
structure and movement to it okay so as

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
structure and movement to it okay so as
we<00:01:21.030> move<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.780> through<00:01:22.080> through<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> lat<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
we move here through through the lat I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.100 
we move here through through the lat I
am<00:01:23.400> following<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:24.420> carefully<00:01:25.140> every<00:01:25.710> little

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
am following very carefully every little

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.190 
am following very carefully every little
movement<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:29.790> shadow<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.990> can

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
movement of that shadow that I can

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.929 
movement of that shadow that I can
capture<00:01:31.409> within<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> few<00:01:32.340> moments<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.820> give

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
capture within a few moments I give

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
capture within a few moments I give
myself<00:01:33.090> only<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.479> few<00:01:33.750> moments<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.530> area

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
myself only a few moments in one area

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.950 
myself only a few moments in one area
and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.130> move<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> keep

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and then I move on that way I keep

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
and then I move on that way I keep
moving<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.189> from<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.729> section<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
moving you know from one section to the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
moving you know from one section to the
other<00:01:39.470> pretty<00:01:40.470> freely<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.430> don't<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> get

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
other pretty freely I don't want to get

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.190 
other pretty freely I don't want to get
bogged<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> any<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:44.100> spot<00:01:44.990> there's<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
bogged down in any one spot there's the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.039 
bogged down in any one spot there's the
very<00:01:46.470> bottom<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.729> fibers<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
very bottom of the fibers there at the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
very bottom of the fibers there at the
latissimus<00:01:49.500> dorsi<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> Anatomy

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
latissimus dorsi now this Anatomy

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.069 
latissimus dorsi now this Anatomy
that<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.560> drawing<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.079> study

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that I'm drawing you know I study

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.350 
that I'm drawing you know I study
Anatomy<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> enjoy<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> idea<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.909> Anatomy<00:01:57.329> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
Anatomy I enjoy the idea of Anatomy I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.940 
Anatomy I enjoy the idea of Anatomy I
think<00:01:57.600> Anatomy<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.229> very<00:01:58.409> inspirational

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
think Anatomy can be very inspirational

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.539

exercise<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.210> study<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.159> everybody

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

exercise and study but but not everybody
thinks<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> way<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:07.110> just

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
thinks that way and and if you can just

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.590 
thinks that way and and if you can just
force<00:02:08.039> yourself<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
force yourself to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.890 
force yourself to
just<00:02:09.990> do<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> little<00:02:10.650> bit<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.570> exploration<00:02:12.570> of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
just do a little bit of exploration of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.720 
just do a little bit of exploration of
the<00:02:13.050> parts<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> body<00:02:13.680> particularly<00:02:14.490> here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
deltoid things like that you know we

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.980 
deltoid things like that you know we
don't<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.940> them<00:02:27.090> by<00:02:27.210> heart<00:02:27.240> but<00:02:27.780> you

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
don't have to know them by heart but you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.750 
don't have to know them by heart but you
become<00:02:28.350> acquainted<00:02:28.950> with<00:02:28.980> these<00:02:29.190> muscles<00:02:29.610> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
become acquainted with these muscles and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.290 
become acquainted with these muscles and
then<00:02:30.240> automatically<00:02:31.020> your<00:02:31.350> your<00:02:32.130> pen<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
then automatically your your pen a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.200 
then automatically your your pen a
pencil<00:02:33.570> point<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.500> begin<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.190> follow<00:02:35.910> them

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
pencil point will begin to follow them

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.420 
pencil point will begin to follow them
even<00:02:37.020> when<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> drawing<00:02:38.010> out<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.310> your

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
even when you do a drawing out of your

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.360 
even when you do a drawing out of your
head<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.910> will<00:02:39.510> sort<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.990> mimic<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.190> some

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
head it will sort of mimic this is some

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.850 
head it will sort of mimic this is some
of<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:42.110> muscular<00:02:45.200> undulation<00:02:46.200> z'<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.680> are

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
of the muscular undulation z' that are

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.540 
of the muscular undulation z' that are
there<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.400> nature<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.350> I'm<00:02:49.800> relying<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.400> lot

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
there in nature and so I'm relying a lot

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.210 
there in nature and so I'm relying a lot
of<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.450> know<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.020> that

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
of that on you know a lot of that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.530 
of that on you know a lot of that
whatever<00:02:53.220> instinct<00:02:53.760> I've<00:02:53.910> developed<00:02:54.210> from

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
whatever instinct I've developed from

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.500 
whatever instinct I've developed from
studying<00:02:54.990> them<00:02:55.140> out<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> anatomy<00:02:56.210> in<00:02:57.210> this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
studying them out of the anatomy in this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.270 
studying them out of the anatomy in this
drawing<00:02:57.810> because<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.440> cut<00:02:58.680> especially<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
drawing because we cut especially this

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.770 
drawing because we cut especially this
first<00:02:59.490> stage<00:02:59.820> for<00:03:00.030> because<00:03:00.210> we<00:03:00.330> move<00:03:00.540> through

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
first stage for because we move through

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
first stage for because we move through
it<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.020> quickly<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.800> don't<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.070> time<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.550> sit

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
it so quickly we don't have time to sit

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.090 
it so quickly we don't have time to sit
and<00:03:02.790> consider<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.690> weigh<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.290> think<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and consider and weigh and think you

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.130 
and consider and weigh and think you
know<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.850> we're<00:03:05.970> drawing<00:03:06.180> but

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
know what is that that we're drawing but

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.420 
know what is that that we're drawing but
they<00:03:07.320> are<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:07.890> these<00:03:08.070> things<00:03:08.280> are<00:03:08.400> very

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
they are all these things are very

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.720 
they are all these things are very
specific<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.710> move<00:03:10.920> more<00:03:11.100> slowly<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.610> can

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
specific and as I move more slowly I can

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.030 
specific and as I move more slowly I can
actually<00:03:12.360> sit<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:12.990> say<00:03:13.200> okay<00:03:13.500> here's<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
actually sit and say okay here's the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610 
actually sit and say okay here's the
nice<00:03:14.730> critical<00:03:15.360> spot<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:15.960> going<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.140> move<00:03:16.350> it

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
nice critical spot I'm going to move it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.440 
nice critical spot I'm going to move it
just<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.220> make<00:03:17.400> an<00:03:17.490> adjustment<00:03:17.610> right<00:03:18.150> there

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
just to make an adjustment right there

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.980 
just to make an adjustment right there
of<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:20.040> external<00:03:20.550> oblique<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.270> there's<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
of the external oblique and there's the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.200 
of the external oblique and there's the
meeting<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> external<00:03:23.040> oblique<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.520> the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
meeting of the external oblique and the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.990 
meeting of the external oblique and the
rectus<00:03:25.170> abdominus<00:03:25.290> right<00:03:25.830> there<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.760> now<00:03:26.940> we

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
rectus abdominus right there so now we

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.760 
rectus abdominus right there so now we
have<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.630> little<00:03:27.930> more<00:03:28.110> definition<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
have a little more definition and

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.650 
have a little more definition and
contrast<00:03:29.550> I'm<00:03:29.910> not<00:03:30.060> trying<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.300> do<00:03:30.420> anything

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
contrast I'm not trying to do anything

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.080 
contrast I'm not trying to do anything

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
too fancy inside the shadow but the edge

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.080 
too fancy inside the shadow but the edge
of<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.450> shadow<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:34.380> really<00:03:35.040> moving<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.880> a

of the shadow is really moving with a
lot<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:38.270> action<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:40.130> that's<00:03:41.130> pretty

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
lot of action and that's pretty

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.560 
lot of action and that's pretty
important
