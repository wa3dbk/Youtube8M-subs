can<00:00:50.309> pretty<00:00:50.520> well<00:00:50.610> eyeball<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.449> that's<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
can pretty well eyeball this that's the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.069 
can pretty well eyeball this that's the
best<00:00:51.989> method<00:00:52.410> we've<00:00:52.590> found<00:00:53.629> get<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.809> drill

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
best method we've found get your drill

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
best method we've found get your drill
where<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.530> bubble<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> middle

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
where your bubble is right in the middle

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
where your bubble is right in the middle
of<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.969> circle<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.680> then<00:00:58.680> slowly<00:00:59.010> begin<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
of that circle and then slowly begin to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.700 
of that circle and then slowly begin to
drill<00:00:59.789> down<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.420> keep<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.809> bubble<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.410> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
drill down and keep that bubble right in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
drill down and keep that bubble right in
the<00:01:02.010> middle<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> circle<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:06.290> as

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the middle of that circle as you go as

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.209 
the middle of that circle as you go as
you<00:01:07.590> come<00:01:07.770> back<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.700> bit

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
our hole drilled in our decoy right here

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.569 
our hole drilled in our decoy right here
for<00:01:17.020> our<00:01:17.109> head<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.890> next<00:01:18.159> process<00:01:18.340> is

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
for our head the next process is

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.669 
for our head the next process is
painting<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.179> for<00:01:19.359> paint<00:01:20.170> we're<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.530> going

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
painting it for paint we're just going

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.380 
painting it for paint we're just going
to<00:01:20.710> use<00:01:20.770> regular<00:01:21.159> spray<00:01:21.939> paint<00:01:22.179> that<00:01:22.329> we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
to use regular spray paint that we

to use regular spray paint that we
picked<00:01:22.569> up<00:01:22.659> from<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:22.899> store<00:01:23.009> we've<00:01:24.009> also<00:01:24.189> got

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
picked up from the store we've also got

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.940

some black and white acrylic paint that
we're<00:01:27.039> going<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.189> use<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.549> touch<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.850> decoy

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
we're going to use the touch the decoy

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.809 
we're going to use the touch the decoy
up<00:01:28.299> add<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.479> little<00:01:28.719> bit<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.899> detail<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.229> it

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
up add a little bit of detail to it

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.130 
up add a little bit of detail to it
first<00:01:30.819> step<00:01:31.060> is<00:01:31.209> going<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.420> be<00:01:31.539> to<00:01:31.689> paint<00:01:31.899> white

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
first step is going to be to paint white

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.380 
first step is going to be to paint white
white<00:01:32.829> overspray<00:01:33.459> is<00:01:33.520> more<00:01:33.789> than<00:01:33.909> black<00:01:34.119> dust
