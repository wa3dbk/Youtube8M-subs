00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.830
 and welcome to a mode trick 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.630
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.580
 this trick is to get duplicate 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.950
 the vehicles unlimitedly 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.110
 infinitely as you want to call it and 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.420
 it's a very easy trick to do and what 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.650
 better is that it's done on solos so 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.570
 Well let's start with the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.550
 tutorial well once we are in 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.770
 the online gta what we have to do 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.360
 is to ride in our vehicle we 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 we went outside the garage garage 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.720
 it has to be full it's very important 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 and well, we'll have to take a 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.040
 street vehicle we ride and we 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.960
 put in the garage will tell us what is 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.059
 full then we will have to replace 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.399
 the vehicle that we have taken from the street 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.660
 that in my case it was tourism and 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.850
 we will have to replace it with the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.010
 Street vehicle once this is done 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.320
 we leave the garage and once we are 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.640
 outside we will have to ride in our 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.530
 vehicle that is the one that in theory we have 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.969
 taken out of our garage now it's not 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.590
 our now what you have to do is 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.300
 put it in our garage will tell us that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.630
 It's also full and now what's 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.250
 to do is Equis and circle time if 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.170
 You get inside the garage like you 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.030
 happened to me means that it went wrong 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.830
 and now to not lose the vehicle that 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 It is very important because we replace it 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 by the street vehicle 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 and then we would have the vehicle 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.010
 again again in case it comes out 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.390
 bad if you get it right it's worth you 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.700
 disappear the vehicle fix that what 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.660
 I'll make here do it again 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 exactly the same 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.520
 We put the vehicle in the garage and 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.680
 I give the X and the circle at the same time 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 it goes badly to me as simply 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.369
 go back and if you go back in and if you 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 get into the garage like before 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.570
 happened then simply replace it with 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.040
 the vehicle before and we do again 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.020
 the same process that I explained to you 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.820
 principle and good then when they have 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 out you have to leave the vehicle 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 invisible we go up here and then 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.790
 will again the vehicle to be 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.979
 normal and now we just go back to 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.470
 our garage and we'll get into the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.550
 garage but without being inside our 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.619
 vehicle the vehicle has to stay 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.810
 out and now this one once we're here 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 will tell us that we have to replace another 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.830
 vehicle and what we will do this is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.110
 replace the vehicle that we have caught 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 from the street so good now we go out to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 ride in our vehicle and then 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.700
 we do the trick again this 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.750
 circle and the X at the same time 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.730
 I'll do the trick again 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.500
 and what you have to do is x and circle 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.200
 until it comes out once the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.310
 invisible car we do again 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.170
 exactly the same and so on all the time 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.140
 and we can duplicate the vehicles 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.880
 infinitely worth is a very easy trick 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.680
 to do and I recommend that you see it with 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.110
 cars that do not do much to practice 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.280
 a little bit and if you get it wrong then you do what 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.360
 same as I said before about 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.180
 replace the vehicle 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.740
 this street is worth in case 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.780
 go wrong and if it goes well we can 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.390
 substituting vehicles that we do not like 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.340
 and so then we can sell them and 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.170
 well do infinite money so good 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.180
 Well, you're everything if you liked the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.920
