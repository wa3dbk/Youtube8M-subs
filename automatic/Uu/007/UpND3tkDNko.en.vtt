putang<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.390> have<00:02:46.599> no<00:02:46.750> idea<00:02:46.989> what<00:02:47.110> that

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
putang and I have no idea what that

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.670 
putang and I have no idea what that
means<00:02:47.849> so<00:02:48.849> let's<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.239> think<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.840> draw

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
means so let's see I think it can draw

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.240 
means so let's see I think it can draw
read<00:02:50.950> now<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.560> what<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.739> have<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.129> do

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250

and<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.879> said<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.329> this<00:02:55.720> game<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.170> really

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
and like I said this this game is really

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.729 
and like I said this this game is really
suitable<00:02:56.799> for<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:58.359> galaxy<00:02:58.720> note<00:02:58.930> because<00:02:59.349> of

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
suitable for the galaxy note because of

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.500 
suitable for the galaxy note because of
specially<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.640> s-pen<00:03:01.060> along<00:03:01.329> with

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
specially because the s-pen along with

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.800 
specially because the s-pen along with
it<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:02.019> actually<00:03:02.220> draw<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.810> different

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it so I can actually draw a different

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.509 
it so I can actually draw a different
things<00:03:04.989> well<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:05.920> case<00:03:06.160> since<00:03:06.370> I

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
things well but in this case since I

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.580 
things well but in this case since I
have<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.790> actually<00:03:06.940> draw<00:03:07.299> read<00:03:07.569> I'm<00:03:07.780> probably

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
have to actually draw read I'm probably

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.680 
have to actually draw read I'm probably
going<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.889> be<00:03:09.010> little<00:03:09.459> clever<00:03:09.910> about<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.450> just

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
going to be little clever about and just

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.740 
going to be little clever about and just
take<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.500> pain<00:03:12.090> take<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.239> red<00:03:13.420> color<00:03:13.660> and

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
take the pain take the red color and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:27.840 
take the pain take the red color and
just<00:03:15.450> color<00:03:16.450> my<00:03:16.870> whole<00:03:19.319> plane

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.130 

bread<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.020> i<00:03:30.240> just<00:03:31.240> colored<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.720> whole<00:03:31.870> paint

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
bread and i just colored the whole paint

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
bread and i just colored the whole paint
red<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:34.230> send<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.350> drawing<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.830> I'm

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
red and I send the drawing and I'm

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.130 
red and I send the drawing and I'm
hoping<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.300> person<00:03:37.690> would<00:03:37.780> be<00:03:37.840> able<00:03:38.080> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
hoping that that person would be able to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.450 
hoping that that person would be able to
figure<00:03:38.320> out<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:39.040> word<00:03:39.190> was<00:03:39.340> red<00:03:39.580> but<00:03:40.380> and

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
figure out that the word was red but and

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.040 
figure out that the word was red but and
so<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.580> goes<00:03:42.610> back<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.180> forth<00:03:43.240> so<00:03:43.690> i<00:03:43.720> would

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
so it goes back and forth so i would

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.390 
so it goes back and forth so i would
guess<00:03:44.290> oh<00:03:46.320> one<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.350> his<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.920> then<00:03:48.040> he<00:03:48.070> would

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
guess oh one of his and then he would

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.700 
guess oh one of his and then he would
guess<00:03:48.580> one<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.880> mine<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.270> let's<00:03:50.020> get<00:03:50.560> out<00:03:50.680> of

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
guess one of mine so let's get out of

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.710 
guess one of mine so let's get out of
that<00:03:50.950> game<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.280> that's<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:52.060> fun<00:03:52.270> game<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.540> play

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
that game and that's a fun game to play

the game actually is and you have a lot
of<00:06:56.180> as<00:06:57.349> you<00:06:58.349> can<00:06:58.589> see<00:06:58.889> over<00:06:59.129> here<00:06:59.870> you<00:07:00.870> have<00:07:01.080> a

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
of as you can see over here you have a

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.350 
of as you can see over here you have a
lot<00:07:01.319> of<00:07:01.349> these<00:07:01.560> what<00:07:02.039> Ike<00:07:02.190> what<00:07:02.789> Camille<00:07:03.120> looks

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
lot of these what Ike what Camille looks

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.610

more<00:07:03.629> like<00:07:03.839> oil<00:07:04.460> droplets<00:07:05.460> and<00:07:06.060> you<00:07:06.779> can<00:07:07.020> pick

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
more like oil droplets and you can pick

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.700 
more like oil droplets and you can pick
one<00:07:08.009> out<00:07:08.039> and<00:07:09.919> kind<00:07:10.919> of<00:07:11.039> form<00:07:11.430> like<00:07:11.729> a<00:07:12.169> a<00:07:13.169> bond

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
one out and kind of form like a a bond

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.409 
one out and kind of form like a a bond
if<00:07:14.069> you<00:07:14.310> want<00:07:14.490> to<00:07:14.550> call<00:07:14.639> it<00:07:14.699> like<00:07:14.909> a<00:07:14.939> chemistry

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
if you want to call it like a chemistry

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.679 
if you want to call it like a chemistry
bond<00:07:15.750> if<00:07:15.960> you<00:07:16.050> want<00:07:16.229> to<00:07:16.289> call<00:07:16.439> it<00:07:16.500> but<00:07:17.509> you<00:07:18.509> can

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:18.689 
bond if you want to call it but you can

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.320 
bond if you want to call it but you can
keep<00:07:18.900> forming<00:07:19.349> these<00:07:20.279> bonds<00:07:20.819> and<00:07:20.939> bring<00:07:21.210> it

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
keep forming these bonds and bring it

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.309 
keep forming these bonds and bring it
out<00:07:21.419> and<00:07:21.659> then<00:07:21.800> I<00:07:22.800> mean<00:07:23.370> it<00:07:23.490> it<00:07:23.759> does<00:07:24.319> follow

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 
out and then I mean it it does follow

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.320 
out and then I mean it it does follow
laws<00:07:25.770> of<00:07:26.009> physics<00:07:26.129> to<00:07:26.460> a<00:07:26.520> certain<00:07:26.819> extent<00:07:27.150> you

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
laws of physics to a certain extent you

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.990 
laws of physics to a certain extent you
know<00:07:27.479> as<00:07:27.659> as<00:07:27.960> this<00:07:28.800> side<00:07:29.039> becomes<00:07:29.460> heavier<00:07:29.819> it

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
know as as this side becomes heavier it

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.089 
know as as this side becomes heavier it
tends<00:07:30.240> to<00:07:30.360> lean<00:07:30.599> down<00:07:30.710> because<00:07:31.710> of<00:07:31.860> gravity

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 
tends to lean down because of gravity

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:36.379 
tends to lean down because of gravity
and<00:07:33.710> you<00:07:34.710> know<00:07:34.830> you<00:07:34.889> you<00:07:35.460> can<00:07:35.699> basically<00:07:35.939> keep

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
and you know you you can basically keep

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.260 
and you know you you can basically keep
building<00:07:36.599> it<00:07:36.810> and<00:07:36.870> the<00:07:37.139> goal<00:07:37.349> is<00:07:37.379> to<00:07:37.710> bring<00:07:38.270> so

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270 
building it and the goal is to bring so

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.129 
building it and the goal is to bring so
many<00:07:39.330> like<00:07:40.020> 26<00:07:41.270> droplets<00:07:42.270> all<00:07:42.569> the<00:07:42.900> way<00:07:42.990> up<00:07:43.110> to

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 
many like 26 droplets all the way up to

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:44.839 
many like 26 droplets all the way up to
this<00:07:43.409> pipe<00:07:43.710> so<00:07:43.949> I'd<00:07:44.099> have<00:07:44.129> to<00:07:44.430> build<00:07:44.639> it<00:07:44.759> all

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:44.849 
this pipe so I'd have to build it all

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:46.339 
this pipe so I'd have to build it all
the<00:07:45.000> way<00:07:45.089> up<00:07:45.240> to<00:07:45.270> this<00:07:45.539> and<00:07:45.750> then<00:07:46.169> there<00:07:46.319> are

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:46.349 
the way up to this and then there are

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:47.689 
the way up to this and then there are
different<00:07:46.710> levels<00:07:46.740> now<00:07:47.129> this<00:07:47.339> is<00:07:47.460> another

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 
different levels now this is another

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:51.559 
different levels now this is another
very<00:07:48.509> fun<00:07:48.870> app<00:07:49.080> I<00:07:49.560> truly<00:07:50.430> enjoy<00:07:50.819> this<00:07:51.029> so<00:07:51.300> I'm

very fun app I truly enjoy this so I'm
you<00:07:52.139> can<00:07:52.319> hear<00:07:52.349> you<00:07:52.770> can<00:07:52.800> try

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:54.289 
you can hear you can try

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:57.010 
you can hear you can try
you're<00:07:55.099> handed<00:07:55.490> this<00:07:55.639> and<00:07:55.939> hopefully<00:07:56.899> you'll

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.020 
you're handed this and hopefully you'll

you're handed this and hopefully you'll
enjoy<00:07:57.110> it<00:07:57.349> too<00:07:57.589> so<00:07:57.860> I<00:07:58.069> guess<00:07:58.520> that's<00:07:58.909> pretty

00:07:59.739 --> 00:07:59.749 
enjoy it too so I guess that's pretty

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:02.920 
enjoy it too so I guess that's pretty
much<00:07:59.960> about<00:08:00.139> it<00:08:00.499> for<00:08:01.089> some<00:08:02.089> of<00:08:02.240> the<00:08:02.360> you<00:08:02.869> know

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:02.930 
much about it for some of the you know

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.850 
much about it for some of the you know
more<00:08:03.319> fun<00:08:03.770> games<00:08:04.869> more<00:08:05.869> suitable<00:08:06.439> which

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:06.860 
more fun games more suitable which

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.920 
more fun games more suitable which
looked<00:08:07.159> really<00:08:07.460> good<00:08:07.849> on<00:08:08.029> the<00:08:08.330> galaxy<00:08:08.749> known

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:08.930 
looked really good on the galaxy known

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.109 
looked really good on the galaxy known
as<00:08:09.050> such<00:08:09.259> and<00:08:09.529> now<00:08:09.710> I<00:08:09.949> hope<00:08:10.460> you<00:08:10.610> guys<00:08:10.789> enjoyed
