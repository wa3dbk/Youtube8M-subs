00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
very very different the professionals

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.940

get<00:00:43.670> first<00:00:44.670> crack<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.690> wood<00:00:45.950> that's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
get first crack at all the wood that's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.600 
get first crack at all the wood that's
produced<00:00:47.370> by<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> company<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:50.160> big<00:00:50.340> thing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
produced by a company so the big thing

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.970 
produced by a company so the big thing
with<00:00:50.730> ash<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.329> why<00:00:51.870> Major<00:00:52.140> Leaguers<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
with ash and why Major Leaguers like it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
with ash and why Major Leaguers like it
is<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.550> feel<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> crack<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> bat

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
is the feel and the crack of the bat

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.290 
is the feel and the crack of the bat
it's<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> most<00:00:55.860> purest<00:00:56.430> most<00:00:56.670> natural

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
it's one of the most purest most natural

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's one of the most purest most natural
feeling<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.320> sounding<00:00:58.770> swings<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.430> baseball

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
feeling and sounding swings in baseball

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.920 
feeling and sounding swings in baseball
so<00:01:00.750> ash<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> great<00:01:01.800> feel<00:01:02.129> bat<00:01:02.449> might<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.660> be

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so ash is a great feel bat might not be

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800 
so ash is a great feel bat might not be
the<00:01:04.170> best<00:01:04.409> option<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:06.090> guy<00:01:06.240> who<00:01:06.299> wants<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the best option for the guy who wants to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.450 
the best option for the guy who wants to
buy<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> bat<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.799> last<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.310> season

harder wood so the ball is going to pop
a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.759> better<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> come

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a little bit better it's going to come

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200 
a little bit better it's going to come
off<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> bat<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.439> bit<00:01:28.740> quicker<00:01:29.210> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
off the bat a little bit quicker and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
off the bat a little bit quicker and
they're<00:01:30.420> gonna<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.619> more

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
they're gonna be a little bit more

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.350 
they're gonna be a little bit more
durable<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.369> well<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.729> these<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.090> hold

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
durable as well so these are gonna hold

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.609 
durable as well so these are gonna hold
up<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.780> bit<00:01:33.930> better<00:01:34.079> than<00:01:34.290> ash<00:01:36.619> next

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619

I've<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.520> bamboo<00:01:39.329> bat<00:01:40.340> bamboo<00:01:41.340> I've<00:01:41.640> used

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
I've got a bamboo bat bamboo I've used

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.660 
I've got a bamboo bat bamboo I've used
this<00:01:42.180> last<00:01:42.540> summer<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.280> thought<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> was

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this last summer and thought that it was

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.359 
this last summer and thought that it was
great<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.750> only<00:01:46.409> batting<00:01:46.770> practice<00:01:47.189> because

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
great for only batting practice because

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
great for only batting practice because
it's<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.700> durable<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.990> true<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> does

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it's so durable that is true but it does

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.130 
it's so durable that is true but it does
have<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> great<00:01:50.790> feel<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.540> great<00:01:51.840> pop

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have a great feel and it has great pop

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.429 
have a great feel and it has great pop
as<00:01:52.380> well<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.060> looking<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.930> b.p

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
add to this as well when dealing with

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.950 
add to this as well when dealing with
the<00:02:31.100> tightness<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.820> grains<00:02:32.120> now<00:02:32.750> that's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960
