simple<00:01:54.380> little<00:01:54.800> things<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.190> I'm<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:55.490> to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
simple little things that I'm going to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.400 
simple little things that I'm going to
have<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.880> change<00:01:56.180> there's<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.600> couple<00:01:56.810> brackets

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
have to change there's a couple brackets

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.020 
have to change there's a couple brackets
that<00:01:57.590> are<00:01:57.620> different<00:01:59.080> there's<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:01.060> think<00:02:02.060> it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
that are different there's I think it's

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030 
that are different there's I think it's
you<00:02:05.030> know<00:02:05.060> where<00:02:05.930> did<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.500> there's<00:02:06.950> one

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
you know where did it go there's one

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.710 
you know where did it go there's one
motor<00:02:07.640> mount<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.210> a<00:02:08.390> little<00:02:08.600> bit

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
motor mount that's a little bit

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.560 
motor mount that's a little bit
different<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.200> think<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.830> one<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.570> then

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
different I think it's this one and then

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.760 
different I think it's this one and then
there's<00:02:11.870> actually<00:02:12.110> one<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:14.900> here<00:02:15.350> maybe<00:02:15.620> you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
there's actually one down here maybe you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.080 
there's actually one down here maybe you
can't<00:02:16.010> see<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> motors<00:02:16.610> lean<00:02:16.790> sideways

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
can't see it the motors lean sideways

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.880 
can't see it the motors lean sideways
but<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.660> motor<00:02:17.900> bracket<00:02:18.140> I'm<00:02:18.410> gonna<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.740> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
but this motor bracket I'm gonna have to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.710 
but this motor bracket I'm gonna have to
change<00:02:19.070> minds<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.700> know<00:02:19.730> from<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.090> 2000

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
change minds you know from the 2000

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.060 
change minds you know from the 2000
Grand<00:02:21.500> Am<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> 2002<00:02:23.350> pontiac<00:02:24.350> montana<00:02:24.530> van

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
Grand Am to a 2002 pontiac montana van

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.470 
Grand Am to a 2002 pontiac montana van
just<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.550> motor<00:02:25.760> mounts<00:02:26.060> are<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> little<00:02:26.300> bit

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
just the motor mounts are a little bit

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.050 
just the motor mounts are a little bit
different<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:26.900> that's<00:02:27.110> not<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> big<00:02:27.530> deal

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
different but that's not a big deal

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.010 
different but that's not a big deal
otherwise<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.300> rest<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> water<00:02:29.780> looks

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
otherwise the rest of the water looks

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.500 
otherwise the rest of the water looks
pretty<00:02:30.260> good<00:02:30.440> so
