again<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> top<00:01:20.250> 10<00:01:20.490> fantasy<00:01:20.670> quarterback<00:01:21.270> last

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
again a top 10 fantasy quarterback last

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
again a top 10 fantasy quarterback last
year<00:01:21.720> does<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.170> again<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.650> year<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
year does he do it again this year I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.410 
year does he do it again this year I
certainly<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.820> he's<00:01:24.060> got<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> lot<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
certainly think so he's got a lot of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
one of the things that I really like

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.310 
one of the things that I really like
about<00:01:35.939> receivers<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.229> an

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
about receivers is when they put in an

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
about receivers is when they put in an
effort<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> catch<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.950> also<00:01:38.040> his<00:01:38.610> completion

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
effort to catch them also his completion

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.539 
effort to catch them also his completion
percentage<00:01:39.479> should<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.380> greatly<00:01:40.890> so

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
percentage should go up greatly so

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.010 
percentage should go up greatly so

he can get healthy can certainly be a
help<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.040> think<00:02:15.160> having<00:02:15.370> Jordan<00:02:15.670> Cameron

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
help and I think having Jordan Cameron

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.430 
help and I think having Jordan Cameron
Jordan<00:02:16.270> camera<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.930> stay<00:02:17.080> healthy<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
Jordan camera can stay healthy in the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.930 
Jordan camera can stay healthy in the
middle<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> field<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.400> somebody<00:02:18.790> else

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
middle of the field that's somebody else

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.440 
to take the defense's attention away but
I<00:02:20.830> think<00:02:20.980> Jarvis<00:02:21.250> Landry<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.640> poised<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:21.970> big

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450
