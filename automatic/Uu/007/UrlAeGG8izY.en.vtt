let<00:00:39.530> me<00:00:39.680> explain

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 

this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> Maruti<00:01:10.230> Suzuki<00:01:10.410> auto<00:01:11.040> gearshift

it's<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.510> automatic<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> manual

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's not an automatic it's not a manual

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it's an automated manual transmission so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.360 
it's an automated manual transmission so
you<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.790> no<00:01:21.090> clutch

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
how do gear shifts happen then well it's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.670
