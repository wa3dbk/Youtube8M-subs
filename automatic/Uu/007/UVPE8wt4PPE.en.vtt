00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.510 

Oh

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.720 

I<00:00:56.580> can't<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
I can't get in

I can't get in
I<00:00:58.790> made<00:00:59.510> Mikey

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.420 

yeah

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.990 

just<00:01:08.120> like<00:01:08.800> Mikey<00:01:09.800> was<00:01:10.040> needed<00:01:10.490> in<00:01:10.640> order<00:01:10.820> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
just like Mikey was needed in order to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.290 
just like Mikey was needed in order to
get<00:01:11.270> into<00:01:11.600> my<00:01:11.750> car<00:01:12.050> we<00:01:12.950> have<00:01:13.250> very<00:01:13.670> different

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
get into my car we have very different

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.520 
get into my car we have very different
types<00:01:14.540> of<00:01:14.690> proteins<00:01:15.230> called<00:01:15.680> enzymes<00:01:16.310> enzymes

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
types of proteins called enzymes enzymes

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.970 
types of proteins called enzymes enzymes
work<00:01:18.530> much<00:01:19.190> in<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.520> same<00:01:19.760> fashion<00:01:20.120> as

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
work much in the same fashion as

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.880 
work much in the same fashion as
lock<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.370> key<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:22.000> order<00:01:22.540> for<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.990> enzyme<00:01:23.380> in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
lock and key in order for the enzyme in

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.690 
lock and key in order for the enzyme in
your<00:01:24.250> body<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:28.120> work<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:29.140> has<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.500> fit<00:01:30.040> into<00:01:30.400> a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
your body to work it has to fit into a

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.770 
your body to work it has to fit into a
specific<00:01:31.090> lock<00:01:32.670> once<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.940> fits<00:01:34.240> into<00:01:34.480> that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
specific lock once it fits into that

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.060 
specific lock once it fits into that
lock

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
lock

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.890 
lock
and<00:01:36.490> only<00:01:36.820> then

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
okay just a minute ago I was talking to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.570 
okay just a minute ago I was talking to
you<00:01:48.050> about<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.380> different<00:01:48.710> functions<00:01:49.430> of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
you about the different functions of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.910 
you about the different functions of
proteins<00:01:49.730> well<00:01:50.360> right<00:01:51.080> now<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.350> want<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.710> talk
