 I made a space with the children of the class and my friend chocolate, but everyone was hand-made chocolate properly 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.270
 Even though 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.659
 I was bothersome to make and bought cheap at the supermarket 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.929
 It was only packed in a female voice chocolate bag 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:31.729
 Furthermore I exchanged with my classmates without passing chocolate from me to my father and brother 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:33.810
 I just finished raising the chocolate that I could not eat 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.740
