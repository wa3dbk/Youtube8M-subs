00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 now pixelated with our columnist 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.810
 easy shore 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.200
 Hello my friends, I miss you and I know you 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 there again here for you 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.820
 beauty today I wanted to show a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 very nice commercial made by a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.230
 assembly producer is a brand of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.130
 milk the anchor 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 so what's cool about this commercial is 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.140
 idea that if milk were created to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 receive light 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.790
 then cows should also be 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 made of a material that would leave 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:54.210
 the light very well then the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.870
 challenge there we will make this logic 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.300
 digital friends for this the producer 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.550
 used a software package in which the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 box and package consists of some 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.920
 software with a strong genome, it is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.440
 will cover needs such as manipulation 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 of particles to simulate the liquid 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.740
 in the water 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.720
 said a certain artist, Michelangelo, who 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.649
 work of art was always there within the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 marble block 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.420
 he only remove the excesses here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 virtually speaking the same thing in a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.479
 digital block in which the artist 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.760
 modeler sculpts by removing all 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.380
 unnecessary parts until it becomes 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.320
 with the anatomical silhouette of this animal that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.479
 is the cow now in a second moment we 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.420
 We need to move this cow. 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.040
 for the professional animator 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.380
 responsible for giving movement may 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.360
 work for this are created 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 tools through a process 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.430
 called ring which is what you create the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 skeleton and support points that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.920
 animator is able to perform 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 what would be the actual behavior of a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.659
 Cow is moving now, yes I can. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.549
 teach her our mix of 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.700
 What I want to see is how 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.160
 this second process results in 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.769
 in a kind of still coarse liquid 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.310
 that by banging the walls and having 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.120
 behavior generates some tips 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.890
 very delicate behavior that in a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 visually for us it will not look like 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.850
 still the link of the real then enters still 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.300
 another process that is to soften the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.760
 this mesh and the drops are not the small ones 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.490
 waves and oscillations that occur in this 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.790
 virtual book becomes the closest 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.070
 possible of a true liquid is and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.960
 with the consistency of the milk hour 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.570
 finally we have then our milk 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.720
 swinging inside the cute kitty 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.090
 Let's now turn the cow into a cow. 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.500
 The glass is a material that takes 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 into consideration a series of 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.610
 physical behaviors refraction and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.800
 light reflection 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.980
 this behaves like this 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.590
 material that we associate as glass 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.440
 physically speaking and now that we have 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.900
 this beautiful and swaggering kitty with 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.150
 its milk inside we can insert the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.460
 in a real world 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.710
 in the filmed times so that she 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.140
 behave according to the nature of the 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.060
 and I gave you this 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.140
 wonderful business that you will 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:34.370
 watch now do not broadcast far 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.370
 no need any years 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.319
 took 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.190
 I do not think cozman time wants to ride 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:04:03.130
 ae micky ward of indians my twitter net 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:09.709
 or two marches text singers understands 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:11.630
 the toxic tongue pinch of gymkhana then 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.340
 For today, it's just people once more here. 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.519
 directly from Bradesco Theater 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.500
 In fact, get excited, but go to the theater. 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.230
 Another thing that is thinking here could 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.660
 have put a chocolate on the cow 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.230
 that shaken it was cool I think 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.040
 You do not mess with me, she's with me. 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.040
 I'll issue an order
