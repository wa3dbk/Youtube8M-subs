00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 good morning from the tech italy to death 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.170
 metal detector is one of the largest 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.599
 European producers of powerful gods 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 metal detector the only ones that come to 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.029
 impressive depths for those ca 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.099
 for a very long time 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.010
 excellent thanos equal growth coils e 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.170
 brands of metal detector and from the year 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:39.390
 last put their call on the market 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:47.149
 high frequency vlf detector on 14 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:53.850
 kilohertz as you see very well taken care of 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:57.140
 high quality manufacture of which 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.140
 it is very simple to use 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 by operating the appliance 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.179
 I put it with the sensitivity knob 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.490
 almost at the most 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.560
 here we have the knob of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.759
 discrimination that really at the most 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.490
 rules the desired value as shown 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:32.200
 they are few knobs ever needed 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.829
 then there is the function in with selector in 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.810
 discrimination 18 apple metal above 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.789
 which can deduct metals this is the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.129
 three solder adjustment knob 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.049
 of the threshold of sound that when you have 

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:49.270
 don't put it on every threshold to get 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.640
 maximum sensitivity towards the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.229
 selector a frequency changer 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.170
 in which case there are radios 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.200
 similar disturbances or similar devices yes 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.250
 can vary the frequency and feel a lot 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.109
 less disturbances also to the selector of the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.690
 manual ground balancing or 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:13.900
 automat automatically 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.000
 does it all by itself if you put in the manual 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.019
 you have to do the classic pumped by 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.790
 five centimeters to 20 in in the soil e 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.920
 then the hand gradually adjusts with the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:32.440
 balancing maneuver as long as 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:36.130
 the sound becomes very simple stable 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.230
 to use highly professional I do not 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.200
 I have seen how much you work on these 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.849
 thirty years in the metal detector does not risk 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.739
 a device as powerful as this 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.940
 let's do some tests with a little one 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.940
 nellino silver 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:10.430
 45 cm the same test with a German mark 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:31.200
 about 47 10 cents look also at the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:43.280
 speed of southern recognition l 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:43.280
 of the object 55 cm 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:55.570
 this is an iron little dog looking at us 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.160
 also as discrimination as perfect 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.980
 I repeat, this is a very expensive device 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.450
 professional minimal adjustments 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.420
 indispensable but above all worked 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.690
 on power without having to do so many 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.490
 subprogramme programs etc. 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.490
 we see an aluminum can 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:37.000
 I would say that we are about a meter e 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:37.000
 tram one meter one meter one method 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:51.320
 this is the currency that detects on 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:05:06.320
 48 cm face the test with two beautiful 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:10.240
 very mineralized stones support and from 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.240
 always 45 centimeters 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.800
 after so many years of study and 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.980
 design technical tests the right 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.480
 who made a metal detector 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.300
 excellent on our website dell 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.970
 italy there are other tests with tests 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.700
 techniques made in the air and there are also 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.310
 tests with technical comparisons with others 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.380
 appliances made in the ground 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.030
 if you want to visit them you are welcome to 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.030
 see the differences 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:45.570
 here I read I forgot to 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:51.370
 to show something here is a selector 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:53.170
 which says maximum power and basha 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.360
 I have forgotten my promise 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.840
 shiva protection is set to power 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.660
 high if one puts time under it 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.750
 low power c1 puts on 2 sets 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.910
 high power even more powerful but with 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.310
 performance with this selectors 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.990
 in the normal position I would say that it is already 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.990
 very very advanced 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.940
 we feel for other tests from said that 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.420
 Italy 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.420
 regards
