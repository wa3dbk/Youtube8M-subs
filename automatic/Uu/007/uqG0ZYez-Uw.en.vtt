00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
her to grow and she felt that she wasn't

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
her to grow and she felt that she wasn't
growing<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.490> she<00:01:41.549> left<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.119> she<00:01:42.150> pursued

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
growing so she left and she pursued

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020 
growing so she left and she pursued
other<00:01:43.310> opportunities<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.490> her<00:01:44.640> life<00:01:44.820> as

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
other opportunities in her life as
