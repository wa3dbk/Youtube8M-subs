not having a surgery which is crazy
because<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.340> first<00:01:35.549> time<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.850> ever<00:01:35.880> had

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
because the first time we ever had

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
because the first time we ever had
massive<00:01:36.720> amounts<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.049> prayers<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.680> one

got the DSLR and then we got a pretty
two<00:04:01.219> gigabyte<00:04:01.639> class<00:04:02.359> 10<00:04:02.599> card<00:04:03.109> with<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:04.329> I'm

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
two gigabyte class 10 card with it I'm

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.610 
two gigabyte class 10 card with it I'm
not<00:04:05.479> sure<00:04:05.540> at<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.810> right<00:04:05.989> speed<00:04:06.229> on<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.469> right

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
not sure at the right speed on it right

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.920 
not sure at the right speed on it right
speed<00:04:06.829> is<00:04:06.919> 24<00:04:07.579> MBS<00:04:07.909> which<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.269> really<00:04:08.419> good<00:04:08.629> no

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
speed is 24 MBS which is really good no

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.569 
speed is 24 MBS which is really good no
the<00:04:09.139> read<00:04:09.259> speeds<00:04:09.530> 24mb<00:04:10.069> us<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.400> speed

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
the read speeds 24mb us the right speed

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.259 
the read speeds 24mb us the right speed
17<00:04:10.879> MBS<00:04:11.269> so<00:04:11.840> that's<00:04:12.019> pretty<00:04:12.169> good<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:13.269> we've

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
17 MBS so that's pretty good and we've

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.830 
17 MBS so that's pretty good and we've
got

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
got

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.020

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
times better than video camera no matter

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.030 
times better than video camera no matter
what<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:55.139> one<00:04:55.350> is<00:04:55.440> always<00:04:55.680> gonna<00:04:55.770> be<00:04:55.860> better

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
what this one is always gonna be better

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.560 
what this one is always gonna be better
but<00:04:56.280> they<00:04:56.490> have<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:56.760> get<00:04:56.880> full<00:04:57.120> focus<00:04:57.300> and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
motion like you would on a DSLR on a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.890 
motion like you would on a DSLR on a
camcorder<00:05:13.729> although<00:05:14.729> okay<00:05:15.419> take<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.690> out<00:05:15.870> of

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900

but like the GoPro the gopro HD hero too
nothing<00:05:29.729> is<00:05:30.060> like<00:05:30.389> insane<00:05:30.960> insanely<00:05:31.919> smooth

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
nothing is like insane insanely smooth

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.000 
nothing is like insane insanely smooth
slow<00:05:33.180> motion<00:05:33.539> so<00:05:33.720> we<00:05:34.530> got<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.680> lot<00:05:34.860> of<00:05:34.889> different

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
slow motion so we got a lot of different

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.279 
slow motion so we got a lot of different
angles<00:05:35.550> want<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.030> hit<00:05:36.210> shots<00:05:36.720> with<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.110> lot<00:05:37.260> of
