now<00:00:18.090> we've<00:00:18.300> done<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> couple<00:00:18.810> videos<00:00:18.990> recently

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
now we've done a couple videos recently

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
now we've done a couple videos recently
on<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.580> back<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:22.039> 1040<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.609> had<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> formula

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
on this back in 1040 we had a formula

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.890 
on this back in 1040 we had a formula
back<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.619> 1042<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.769> had<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> formula<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.900> Leonid

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
back in 1042 we had a formula and Leonid

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
back in 1042 we had a formula and Leonid
left<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.010> great<00:00:29.400> comment<00:00:29.939> about<00:00:31.040> some<00:00:32.040> cool

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
left a great comment about some cool

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
left a great comment about some cool
formulas<00:00:33.660> back<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.200> 1040<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.280> want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> look

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
formulas back in 1040 so we want to look

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
formulas back in 1040 so we want to look
at<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.360> these<00:00:36.690> videos<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.410> did<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.829> look

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
at these in these videos we did not look

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000 
at these in these videos we did not look
at<00:00:38.250> mix<00:00:38.610> data<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> formulas<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.260> used

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
at mix data but the formulas we used

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.119 
at mix data but the formulas we used
earlier<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.700> work<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> time

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
earlier will work we also want to time

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
earlier will work we also want to time
the<00:00:44.640> different<00:00:45.000> formulas<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.780> if

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the different formulas and see if

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
the different formulas and see if
there's<00:00:46.050> any<00:00:46.230> difference<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.219> essence

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
there's any difference now the essence

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
there's any difference now the essence
of<00:00:48.120> any<00:00:48.840> unique<00:00:49.590> count<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.600> extracting<00:00:51.600> unique

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
of any unique count or extracting unique

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.760 
of any unique count or extracting unique
list<00:00:52.739> formula<00:00:53.340> usually<00:00:54.270> uses<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.989> frequency

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
list formula usually uses the frequency

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
list formula usually uses the frequency
function<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> trick<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.239> talked

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
function and the trick as we've talked

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
function and the trick as we've talked
about<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> last<00:00:58.170> few<00:00:58.350> videos<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
about in the last few videos is that the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.590 
about in the last few videos is that the
data<00:00:59.850> array<00:01:01.190> comma<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.000> bins<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
data array comma and the bins now the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230 
data array comma and the bins now the
bins<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.110> usually<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> categories<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
bins are usually the categories that you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480 
bins are usually the categories that you
count<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.110> data<00:01:07.320> within<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> give

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
count the data within but if you give

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.719 
count the data within but if you give
the<00:01:09.030> data<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.140> bins<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> exact<00:01:11.189> same

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the data and the bins the exact same

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
the data and the bins the exact same
range<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> should<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.290> 15

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
range and I can see this should be 15

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
range and I can see this should be 15
that's<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.060> trick<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.540> unique<00:01:15.810> counts<00:01:16.140> what

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that's the trick for unique counts what

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
that's the trick for unique counts what
it's<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.250> bins

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's going to do is bins

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's going to do is bins
there's<00:01:18.659> duplicates<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.650> give<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> three

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
there's duplicates we give it a three

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.210 
there's duplicates we give it a three
and<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.640> three<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.479> frequency<00:01:22.320> does<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> bunch

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and a three well frequency does a bunch

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.249 
and a three well frequency does a bunch
of<00:01:23.430> cool<00:01:23.670> things<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.540> ignores<00:01:24.869> empty

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
of cool things one is it ignores empty

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.460 
of cool things one is it ignores empty
cells<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.189> ignores<00:01:26.610> texts<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.290> give

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
cells it ignores texts and if you give

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.700 
cells it ignores texts and if you give
it<00:01:28.500> duplicate<00:01:29.400> bins<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.689> three<00:01:31.470> right

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it duplicate bins like that three right

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
it duplicate bins like that three right
there<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.340> won't<00:01:32.610> count<00:01:32.970> anything<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
there it won't count anything there it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.569 
there it won't count anything there it
will<00:01:33.900> only<00:01:34.170> count<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.829> many<00:01:34.890> threes<00:01:35.369> there

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
will only count how many threes there

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.910 
will only count how many threes there
are<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> first<00:01:36.329> bin<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:37.350> why<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:37.890> we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
are in the first bin that's why when we

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.050 
are in the first bin that's why when we
highlight<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.939> hit<00:01:39.090> f9<00:01:40.040> f9<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> see

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
highlight this in hit f9 f9 we can see

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
highlight this in hit f9 f9 we can see
there's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> count<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.689> two<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> three

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
there's a count of two for this three

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139 
there's a count of two for this three
but<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.220> gets<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.880> fifth

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
but when it gets down to the fifth

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.590 
but when it gets down to the fifth
position<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.930> three<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.070> zero

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
position this three what is there a zero

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
position this three what is there a zero
similarly<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.869> four<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> three

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
similarly for four there's a three

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
similarly for four there's a three
because<00:01:50.130> there's<00:01:50.369> three<00:01:50.640> fours<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.750> next<00:01:52.259> one

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
because there's three fours the next one

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
because there's three fours the next one
gets<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.799> zero<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
gets a zero and then I think it's this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
gets a zero and then I think it's this
one<00:01:54.329> down<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.780> gets<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.079> zero<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
one down here gets a zero so that's the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
one down here gets a zero so that's the
trick<00:01:56.310> now<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> pattern<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.530> numbers

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
trick now we have a pattern of numbers

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.340 
trick now we have a pattern of numbers
that<00:01:58.710> are<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:59.100> zeros<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.180> indicate<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that are not zeros that indicate that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
that are not zeros that indicate that
that<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.860> encountered<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> number<00:02:03.090> for

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that we have encountered the number for

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.319 
that we have encountered the number for
the<00:02:03.420> first<00:02:03.630> time<00:02:04.049> control<00:02:04.710> Z<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.790> what<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.149> we

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the first time control Z so what can we

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.830 
the first time control Z so what can we
do<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:06.930> first<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.439> f9<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.729> pattern<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.660> if

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
do well first off f9 that pattern the if

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
do well first off f9 that pattern the if
function<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.590> interpret<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.250> zeros<00:02:11.700> as

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
function can interpret the zeros as

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.200 
function can interpret the zeros as
false<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> non

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
false and the non

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.540 
false and the non
their<00:02:13.330> own<00:02:13.450> numbers<00:02:13.810> as<00:02:13.990> true<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.340> can

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
their own numbers as true so if we can

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.690 
their own numbers as true so if we can
simply<00:02:15.910> say<00:02:16.090> if<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:17.230> logical<00:02:17.860> test<00:02:18.160> now

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
simply say if that logical test now

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.970 
simply say if that logical test now
normally<00:02:19.390> if<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.600> put<00:02:19.870> an<00:02:20.050> array<00:02:20.380> operation

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
normally if you put an array operation

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.950 
normally if you put an array operation
into<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.490> logical<00:02:22.060> test<00:02:22.120> argument<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
into the logical test argument the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.350 
into the logical test argument the
formula<00:02:23.500> will<00:02:23.710> require<00:02:24.280> control<00:02:24.850> shift<00:02:25.180> enter

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
formula will require control shift enter

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.230 
formula will require control shift enter
but<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.140> cool<00:02:26.440> thing<00:02:26.470> about<00:02:26.800> array<00:02:27.460> functions

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
but the cool thing about array functions

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.840 
but the cool thing about array functions
is<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.140> put<00:02:29.350> them<00:02:29.560> house<00:02:30.130> them<00:02:30.550> even

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
is you can put them house them even

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.280 
is you can put them house them even
though<00:02:30.940> they're<00:02:31.120> doing<00:02:31.240> an<00:02:31.450> array<00:02:31.660> operation

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
though they're doing an array operation

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.980 
though they're doing an array operation
you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.710> house<00:02:32.980> them<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.340> outside<00:02:34.270> functions

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
you can house them in outside functions

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.530 
you can house them in outside functions
and<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.680> will<00:02:35.860> not<00:02:36.190> require<00:02:36.700> control<00:02:37.270> shift

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and it will not require control shift

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
and it will not require control shift
enter<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:37.960> we<00:02:38.320> got<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> bunch<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.890> trues<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
enter so we got a bunch of trues and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.480 
enter so we got a bunch of trues and
falses<00:02:39.400> comma<00:02:40.120> what<00:02:40.750> do<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:40.990> want<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.220> if

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
falses comma what do we want one the if

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.160 
falses comma what do we want one the if
will<00:02:43.360> give<00:02:43.600> us<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.930> string<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.760> falses<00:02:45.760> f9<00:02:46.660> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
will give us a string of falses f9 and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.970 
will give us a string of falses f9 and
ones<00:02:47.530> now<00:02:47.950> we<00:02:48.010> can<00:02:48.310> simply<00:02:48.700> wrap<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
ones now we can simply wrap that in the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.150 
ones now we can simply wrap that in the
sum<00:02:51.280> function<00:02:51.520> now<00:02:51.880> what<00:02:52.150> Leonid<00:02:53.020> pointed<00:02:54.010> out

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
sum function now what Leonid pointed out

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.580 
sum function now what Leonid pointed out
was<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.300> formula<00:02:55.780> does<00:02:55.930> not<00:02:55.990> require

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
was that this formula does not require

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.260 
was that this formula does not require
control<00:02:56.980> shift<00:02:57.340> enter<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:57.850> watch<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.150> I'm

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
control shift enter so watch this I'm

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.290 
control shift enter so watch this I'm
going<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> control<00:02:58.840> enter<00:02:59.140> no<00:02:59.790> curly<00:03:00.790> brackets

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
going to control enter no curly brackets

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.910 
going to control enter no curly brackets
for<00:03:01.480> array<00:03:01.750> operation<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.560> comes<00:03:02.770> from

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
for array operation and that comes from

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.420 
for array operation and that comes from
the<00:03:03.040> fact<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.340> that's<00:03:03.960> an<00:03:04.960> array<00:03:05.620> function

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the fact that that's an array function

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.260 
the fact that that's an array function
now<00:03:07.290> Leonid<00:03:08.290> also<00:03:08.650> pointed<00:03:09.100> out<00:03:09.280> hey<00:03:09.700> why<00:03:09.970> use

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
now Leonid also pointed out hey why use

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.540 
now Leonid also pointed out hey why use
the<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.110> one<00:03:11.380> when<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:12.010> use<00:03:12.280> this

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
the if and the one when you can use this

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.790 
the if and the one when you can use this
sine<00:03:12.940> function<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.200> sine<00:03:14.530> will<00:03:14.920> interpret

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
sine function the sine will interpret

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.600 
sine function the sine will interpret
any<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:18.190> those<00:03:18.430> zeros<00:03:18.850> as<00:03:19.410> 0<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.740> any<00:03:20.920> positive

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
any of those zeros as 0 and any positive

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.030 
any of those zeros as 0 and any positive
number<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.090> one<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.720> look<00:03:23.020> at<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.260> one<00:03:23.470> an<00:03:23.590> F<00:03:23.770> 9

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
number as one so look at this one an F 9

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.490 
number as one so look at this one an F 9
it<00:03:24.280> gives<00:03:24.610> us<00:03:24.760> instead<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.450> falses<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.260> ones

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
it gives us instead of falses and ones

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.400 
it gives us instead of falses and ones
zeros<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.640> ones<00:03:27.790> control-z<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:29.200> can

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
zeros and ones control-z and we can

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.680 
zeros and ones control-z and we can
simply<00:03:29.800> put<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.490> sum<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.090> it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
simply put that in the sum and it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.810 
simply put that in the sum and it

is this is the formula I showed for

counting unique numbers and it's a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.670 
counting unique numbers and it's a

around<00:03:51.100> now<00:03:52.060> we're<00:03:52.990> going<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.140> time<00:03:53.470> these<00:03:53.710> in

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
around now we're going to time these in

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.440 
around now we're going to time these in
a<00:03:54.010> second<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.610> would<00:03:54.850> think<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.150> this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
a second and I would think that this

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.240 
a second and I would think that this
formula<00:03:56.050> would<00:03:56.170> take<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.410> lot<00:03:56.800> longer<00:03:57.040> than

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
formula would take a lot longer than

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.400 
formula would take a lot longer than
these<00:03:57.490> because<00:03:57.700> it's<00:03:58.390> doing<00:03:58.840> an<00:03:59.020> array

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
these because it's doing an array

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.290 
these because it's doing an array
operation<00:04:00.040> here<00:04:00.190> that's<00:04:00.400> one<00:04:00.910> array

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
operation here that's one array

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.420 
operation here that's one array
operation<00:04:01.930> then<00:04:02.380> it's<00:04:02.590> got<00:04:02.770> a<00:04:02.800> comparative

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
operation then it's got a comparative

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.520 
operation then it's got a comparative
operator<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.090> convert<00:04:04.420> those<00:04:04.630> numbers<00:04:05.380> to

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
operator to convert those numbers to

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.260 
operator to convert those numbers to
trues<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:05.800> falses<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.550> then<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.820> got<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.060> has

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
trues and falses and then it got it has

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.360 
trues and falses and then it got it has
to<00:04:07.450> convert<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.290> trues<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.530> falses<00:04:08.710> to<00:04:09.160> ones

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
to convert the trues and falses to ones

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.190 
to convert the trues and falses to ones
and<00:04:09.580> zeros<00:04:09.850> with<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.360> double<00:04:10.750> negative<00:04:10.900> so

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
and zeros with a double negative so

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.520 
and zeros with a double negative so
there's<00:04:11.380> 1<00:04:11.590> 2<00:04:12.010> 3<00:04:12.490> array<00:04:13.090> operations<00:04:13.720> here<00:04:14.350> i

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
there's 1 2 3 array operations here i

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.960 
there's 1 2 3 array operations here i
only<00:04:14.620> count<00:04:15.180> 1<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.570> then<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.650> sign<00:04:17.920> is<00:04:18.400> 2<00:04:18.700> up

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
only count 1 and then the sign is 2 up

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.570 
only count 1 and then the sign is 2 up
here<00:04:19.270> we<00:04:19.420> have<00:04:19.660> 1<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.530> then<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> if<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.549> a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
here we have 1 and then the if is a

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
here we have 1 and then the if is a
second<00:04:22.090> one<00:04:22.180> now<00:04:22.600> here's<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.080> amazing<00:04:23.380> thing

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
second one now here's the amazing thing

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.840 
second one now here's the amazing thing
this<00:04:24.669> formula<00:04:25.419> right

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
this formula right

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
this formula right
here<00:04:26.560> there's<00:04:27.560> three<00:04:28.340> array<00:04:28.940> operations<00:04:29.660> and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
here there's three array operations and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.630 
here there's three array operations and
that's<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.410> comparative<00:04:30.950> operator<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.490> that's

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
that's a comparative operator and that's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.170 
that's a comparative operator and that's
a<00:04:31.820> math<00:04:32.180> operation<00:04:32.560> watch<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:34.280> with<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
a math operation watch this with the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.350 
a math operation watch this with the
frequency<00:04:35.900> function<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:37.490> don't<00:04:37.610> have<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.120> put

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
frequency function you don't have to put

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.740 
frequency function you don't have to put
it<00:04:38.510> inside<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:39.050> some<00:04:39.590> product<00:04:40.160> no<00:04:40.790> what<00:04:41.540> is

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
it inside of some product no what is

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.900 
it inside of some product no what is
going<00:04:41.870> on<00:04:42.260> here<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.250> went<00:04:43.520> back<00:04:43.670> I'm<00:04:43.880> just

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
going on here and I went back I'm just

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.670 
going on here and I went back I'm just
gonna<00:04:44.210> control<00:04:44.600> enter<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.110> don't<00:04:45.350> see<00:04:45.500> any

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
gonna control enter I don't see any

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.230 
gonna control enter I don't see any
curly<00:04:46.010> brackets<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.700> sure<00:04:46.940> looks<00:04:47.180> like

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
curly brackets and it sure looks like

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.360 
curly brackets and it sure looks like
it's<00:04:47.570> working<00:04:47.870> not<00:04:48.620> only<00:04:48.890> that<00:04:49.070> I'm<00:04:49.250> thinking

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
it's working not only that I'm thinking

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.060 
it's working not only that I'm thinking
well<00:04:49.700> maybe<00:04:49.910> it's<00:04:50.530> doing<00:04:51.530> something<00:04:51.890> with

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
well maybe it's doing something with

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.970 
well maybe it's doing something with
implicit<00:04:53.080> intersection<00:04:54.080> come<00:04:54.320> down<00:04:54.500> here

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
implicit intersection come down here

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.850 
implicit intersection come down here
it's<00:04:55.610> working<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.270> went<00:04:56.780> back<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.230> tried<00:04:57.560> this

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
it's working I went back and tried this

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.930 
it's working I went back and tried this
formula<00:04:59.110> whoops<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:02.360> one<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:03.580> didn't<00:05:04.580> I'm

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
formula whoops this one I didn't I'm

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.460 
formula whoops this one I didn't I'm
gonna<00:05:05.150> put<00:05:05.360> this<00:05:05.480> over<00:05:05.690> here<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.290> it's

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
gonna put this over here just so it's

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.310 
gonna put this over here just so it's
consistent<00:05:06.830> uh<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.430> went<00:05:08.420> back<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.840> tried<00:05:09.020> this

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
consistent uh I went back and tried this

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.840 
consistent uh I went back and tried this
and<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.530> was<00:05:09.680> just<00:05:09.710> stunned<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.460> worked<00:05:10.670> in

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
and I was just stunned it worked in

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.250 
and I was just stunned it worked in

Excel 2003 ten thirteen what is going on

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.730 
Excel 2003 ten thirteen what is going on
here<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:15.800> array<00:05:16.280> function<00:05:16.880> is<00:05:17.740> doing

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
here this array function is doing

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.990 
here this array function is doing
something<00:05:18.980> special<00:05:19.070> now<00:05:19.430> here's<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:19.820> deal

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
something special now here's the deal

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.550 
something special now here's the deal
you<00:05:20.150> know<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.330> wrote<00:05:20.600> the<00:05:20.750> book<00:05:20.900> control<00:05:21.290> shift

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
you know I wrote the book control shift

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.920 
you know I wrote the book control shift
enter<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.070> part<00:05:23.030> of<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.180> reason<00:05:23.420> I<00:05:23.510> did<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:23.840> is

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
enter and part of the reason I did it is

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.120 
enter and part of the reason I did it is
I<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.320> just<00:05:24.680> there's<00:05:25.160> no<00:05:25.400> good<00:05:25.730> source<00:05:26.150> for<00:05:26.270> what

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
I I just there's no good source for what

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.360 
I I just there's no good source for what
all<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.280> rules<00:05:28.490> about<00:05:28.790> array<00:05:29.450> formula<00:05:30.140> so<00:05:30.380> you

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
all the rules about array formula so you

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.310 
all the rules about array formula so you
know<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.520> guess<00:05:32.120> this<00:05:32.360> is<00:05:32.540> because<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.170> an

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
know I guess this is because it's an

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.950 
know I guess this is because it's an
array<00:05:33.950> function<00:05:34.550> but<00:05:34.730> nevertheless<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.690> tried

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
array function but nevertheless I tried

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.980 
array function but nevertheless I tried
it<00:05:36.110> a<00:05:36.200> bunch<00:05:36.470> of<00:05:36.680> places<00:05:36.980> and<00:05:37.370> it's<00:05:37.550> working

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
it a bunch of places and it's working

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.450 
it a bunch of places and it's working
all<00:05:38.990> of<00:05:39.260> these<00:05:39.410> working<00:05:39.650> without<00:05:40.040> control

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
all of these working without control

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
comments now let's go look at the timing

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.040 
comments now let's go look at the timing
results<00:05:45.320> head<00:05:45.470> so<00:05:46.130> this<00:05:46.790> is<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.420> hundred

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
results head so this is a hundred

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.090 
results head so this is a hundred
thousand<00:05:48.500> rows<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.220> I<00:05:49.820> did<00:05:50.060> all<00:05:50.960> four<00:05:51.140> of<00:05:51.800> them

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
thousand rows and I did all four of them

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.630 
thousand rows and I did all four of them
now<00:05:52.400> actually<00:05:53.260> this<00:05:54.260> one<00:05:54.500> run<00:05:54.710> right<00:05:55.040> here<00:05:55.460> and

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
now actually this one run right here and

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.490 
now actually this one run right here and
I<00:05:56.240> talked<00:05:56.420> about<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.780> in<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:56.990> book<00:05:57.170> you<00:05:57.350> can

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
I talked about this in the book you can

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.620 
I talked about this in the book you can
use<00:05:57.560> one<00:05:58.250> divider<00:05:58.610> by<00:05:58.820> count<00:05:59.150> if<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.510> there's

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
use one divider by count if and there's

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.380 
use one divider by count if and there's
a<00:05:59.720> bunch<00:05:59.930> of<00:06:00.020> variations<00:06:00.830> on<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:02.180> you

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
a bunch of variations on this if you

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.660 
a bunch of variations on this if you
have<00:06:02.510> a<00:06:02.540> small<00:06:02.870> data<00:06:03.170> set<00:06:03.530> but<00:06:03.770> man<00:06:04.130> if<00:06:04.520> you

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
have a small data set but man if you

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.000 
have a small data set but man if you
have<00:06:04.910> a<00:06:04.940> big<00:06:05.300> data<00:06:05.570> set<00:06:05.750> it<00:06:06.170> blows<00:06:06.530> up<00:06:06.800> your

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
have a big data set it blows up your

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.160 
have a big data set it blows up your
data<00:06:07.550> set<00:06:07.730> I<00:06:07.850> tried<00:06:08.150> to<00:06:08.300> time<00:06:08.510> this<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:08.870> I<00:06:08.930> left

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
data set I tried to time this and I left

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.650 
data set I tried to time this and I left
this<00:06:09.650> formula<00:06:10.100> right<00:06:10.220> here<00:06:10.280> I<00:06:10.700> left<00:06:11.120> it<00:06:11.300> on<00:06:11.360> for

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
this formula right here I left it on for

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.120 
this formula right here I left it on for
five<00:06:11.960> minutes<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.560> it<00:06:12.650> wouldn't<00:06:12.920> calculate

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
five minutes and it wouldn't calculate

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.320 
five minutes and it wouldn't calculate
so<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.700> takes<00:06:13.910> too<00:06:14.120> long

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
so it takes too long

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.290 
so it takes too long
all<00:06:14.810> of<00:06:15.290> these<00:06:15.500> they'll<00:06:15.890> have<00:06:16.100> very<00:06:16.580> similar

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
all of these they'll have very similar

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.670 
all of these they'll have very similar
times<00:06:17.920> so<00:06:19.180> surprising<00:06:20.180> even<00:06:20.480> these<00:06:21.020> two<00:06:21.080> down

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
times so surprising even these two down

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.650 
times so surprising even these two down
here<00:06:22.040> which<00:06:22.250> have<00:06:22.490> three<00:06:22.850> array<00:06:23.120> operations

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
here which have three array operations

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.450 
here which have three array operations
and<00:06:23.870> these<00:06:24.020> up<00:06:24.320> here<00:06:24.530> which<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:24.890> count<00:06:25.160> two

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
and these up here which I count two

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.610 
and these up here which I count two
array<00:06:25.700> operations<00:06:26.240> all<00:06:26.600> getting<00:06:27.200> similar

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
array operations all getting similar

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.240 
array operations all getting similar
times<00:06:28.240> alright<00:06:29.240> so<00:06:29.600> I<00:06:30.110> know<00:06:30.560> that's<00:06:30.860> pretty

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
times alright so I know that's pretty

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.830 
times alright so I know that's pretty
nice<00:06:31.520> there<00:06:31.820> this<00:06:32.180> sign<00:06:32.690> one's<00:06:33.080> totally<00:06:33.590> cool

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
nice there this sign one's totally cool

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.120 
nice there this sign one's totally cool
in<00:06:35.840> our<00:06:36.200> next<00:06:36.710> video

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
in our next video

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.110 
in our next video
10:44<00:06:37.970> will<00:06:38.270> do<00:06:38.540> in

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
10:44 will do in

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.960 
10:44 will do in
Strack<00:06:39.630> unique<00:06:40.229> list<00:06:40.680> with<00:06:41.130> given<00:06:41.760> that<00:06:41.880> we

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
Strack unique list with given that we

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.860 
Strack unique list with given that we
have<00:06:42.120> mixed<00:06:42.389> data<00:06:43.250> 1040<00:06:44.250> if<00:06:44.430> you<00:06:45.180> don't<00:06:45.570> have

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
have mixed data 1040 if you don't have

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.170 
have mixed data 1040 if you don't have
mixed<00:06:46.320> data<00:06:46.530> the<00:06:46.770> formula<00:06:47.310> in<00:06:47.490> Excel<00:06:47.639> magic

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
mixed data the formula in Excel magic

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.140 
mixed data the formula in Excel magic
trick<00:06:48.389> 1040<00:06:49.199> is<00:06:49.350> much<00:06:50.100> easier<00:06:50.669> and<00:06:50.820> you<00:06:50.910> should

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
trick 1040 is much easier and you should

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.020 
trick 1040 is much easier and you should
use<00:06:51.660> that<00:06:51.690> but<00:06:52.050> in<00:06:52.380> our<00:06:52.560> next<00:06:52.800> video<00:06:53.040> 1044

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
use that but in our next video 1044

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.879 
use that but in our next video 1044
we'll<00:06:54.600> see<00:06:54.810> what<00:06:54.960> to<00:06:55.110> do<00:06:55.229> when<00:06:55.380> we<00:06:55.530> want<00:06:55.680> to

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
we'll see what to do when we want to

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.100 
we'll see what to do when we want to
extract<00:06:56.340> unique<00:06:56.790> numbers<00:06:57.389> and<00:06:57.630> sort<00:06:57.960> them

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
extract unique numbers and sort them

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.160 
extract unique numbers and sort them
alright<00:06:58.470> see<00:06:58.710> you<00:06:58.770> next<00:06:58.800> trick
