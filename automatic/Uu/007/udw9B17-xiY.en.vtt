00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.580
 Y 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello all welcome to ney lines if 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.349
 you want to know how to do this manicure 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.470
 of princess keep looking you will need 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.649
 a color enamel rain stone 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.309
 different sizes a thick glaze 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:28.610
 transparent or glue for nails a 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.899
 dot tool and a cardboard or 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.290
 similar surface 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.690
 we will start applying the enamel in my 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.870
 opinion is preferable to use tones 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.060
 pink or niuk like mine though you can 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.210
 serve any other 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.130
 if necessary we apply a second 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.130
 layer up to achieve good coverage 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.290
 it is convenient to leave all the rain 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.310
 stones that we're going to use prepared and 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.650
 face up ready to pick up the number 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.600
 of rain stones will depend on the width of 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.910
 our nails and the size of the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.050
 stones but it is very likely that 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:12.420
 we need about 25 5 large and 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.150
 the rest of a smaller size 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.049
 we put transparent thick glaze 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.509
 in a cardboard or similar surface 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 we wet the dot tool in it and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.659
 we are making dots in the form of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.520
 semicircle on the side of the cuticle 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.720
 You can also do it directly with 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.720
 nail glue 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.530
 then with the same tool we take 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.890
 one of the big stones and the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.080
 place in the center of the semicircle 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.540
 slightly pressing down and 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.190
 the same way we are placing the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.920
 remaining smaller 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.990
 trying to follow the semicircle and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.840
 leaving the ones placed in a sense 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.910
 ascending sideways you can take 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.540
 top coat to seal and uniform the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.370
 design thing advisable although I do not 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.430
 I'm going to do my brain stones 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.820
