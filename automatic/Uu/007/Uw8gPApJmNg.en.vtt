icon or this gallery for the most part

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.860

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
you will have a gallery it I think the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.680 
you will have a gallery it I think the
differences<00:00:57.469> are<00:00:57.739> if<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.879> have<00:00:59.059> a<00:00:59.089> honeycomb

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
differences are if you have a honeycomb

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.650 
differences are if you have a honeycomb
of<00:00:59.899> jellybeans<00:01:00.350> or<00:01:00.559> Ice<00:01:00.800> Cream<00:01:01.100> Sandwich

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
of jellybeans or Ice Cream Sandwich

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.869

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
version of Android it just may have a

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.570 
version of Android it just may have a
different<00:01:05.330> icon<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.680> couple<00:01:07.010> of<00:01:07.190> different

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
different icon and a couple of different

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.300
