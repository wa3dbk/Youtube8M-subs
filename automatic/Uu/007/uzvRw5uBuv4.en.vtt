lot<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.240> these<00:01:39.329> things<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> they'll<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
lot of these things and they'll have to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.810 
lot of these things and they'll have to
take<00:01:40.320> away<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:40.770> those<00:01:40.979> old<00:01:41.130> hack<00:01:41.340> codes<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
take away all those old hack codes and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
take away all those old hack codes and
put<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.270> new<00:01:42.509> code<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.619> course

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
put in some new code and of course

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
put in some new code and of course
eventually<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.270> these

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
eventually you're gonna have all these

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.700 
eventually you're gonna have all these
old<00:01:45.780> they're<00:01:45.869> old<00:01:46.020> games<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.470> they're<00:01:46.560> gonna

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
old they're old games that they're gonna

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
old they're old games that they're gonna
have<00:01:46.920> relied<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.399> those<00:01:47.700> bad<00:01:47.909> acts<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.360> begin

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
have relied on those bad acts to begin

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.969 
have relied on those bad acts to begin
with<00:01:48.720> right<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> take<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:49.860> away

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
with right and when you take them away

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.200 
with right and when you take them away
and<00:01:50.040> put<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> proper<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> find

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and put the proper one you have to find

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
and put the proper one you have to find
out<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> proper<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.500> new<00:01:52.590> game

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
out what the proper one for the new game

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
out what the proper one for the new game
is<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.460> basically<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:54.299> saying<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
is so basically what you're saying is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
is so basically what you're saying is
some<00:01:54.780> people<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> modify<00:01:55.560> roms<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.219> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
some people have to modify roms to get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440 
some people have to modify roms to get
them<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> work<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.729> current<00:01:57.119> versions<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
them to work with current versions of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
them to work with current versions of
the<00:01:57.570> emulator<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.259> when<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> emulator<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the emulator but when the emulator is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
the emulator but when the emulator is
changed<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> roms<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.420> changed<00:02:00.810> back

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
changed the roms have to be changed back

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
changed the roms have to be changed back
or<00:02:01.229> changing<00:02:01.590> another<00:02:01.829> way<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> work<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
or changing another way to work with a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.649 
or changing another way to work with a
new<00:02:02.549> version<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> exactly<00:02:03.450> either

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
new version of the exactly either

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.819 
new version of the exactly either
because<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> part<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> emulation

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
because of part of the emulation

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
because of part of the emulation
software<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> lot<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.880> those<00:02:06.000> visual<00:02:06.390> hacks

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
software or a lot of those visual hacks

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.119 
software or a lot of those visual hacks
that<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.439> order<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> refresh

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that they do in order to get the refresh

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919 
that they do in order to get the refresh
rate<00:02:08.250> look<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.759> they'll<00:02:09.390> start<00:02:09.599> saying<00:02:09.750> oh

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
rate look right they'll start saying oh

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
rate look right they'll start saying oh
we<00:02:10.140> want<00:02:10.319> OpenGL<00:02:10.830> support<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> throne

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
we want OpenGL support so the throne

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
we want OpenGL support so the throne
OpenGL<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.300> forward<00:02:12.569> but

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
OpenGL so forward but

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.600 
OpenGL so forward but

the sprites on the old games don't work

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.970 
the sprites on the old games don't work
myself<00:02:15.030> forth<00:02:15.390> basically<00:02:15.870> Jake<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.740> cuz

stuff<00:02:17.250> gets<00:02:17.460> broken<00:02:17.760> gets<00:02:18.090> fixed<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.570> then<00:02:18.660> it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
stuff gets broken gets fixed and then it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.600 
stuff gets broken gets fixed and then it
gets<00:02:18.810> broken<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.620> has<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.890> be<00:02:19.920> fixed<00:02:20.430> so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
gets broken again and has to be fixed so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.460

question<00:02:24.390> we've<00:02:24.510> got<00:02:24.690> from<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.960> few<00:02:25.140> people<00:02:25.260> is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
question we've got from a few people is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.350 
question we've got from a few people is
whether<00:02:25.830> or<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.190> actually<00:02:26.550> legal<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.970> run

the<00:02:34.530> answer<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.890> pretty<00:02:35.040> much<00:02:35.220> at<00:02:35.400> the
