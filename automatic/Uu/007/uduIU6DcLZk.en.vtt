00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
basically a runner okay so and then you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.429 
basically a runner okay so and then you
just<00:02:04.520> want<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.149> know<00:02:05.240> go<00:02:06.020> around<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
just want to you know go around and

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.260 
just want to you know go around and
check<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:07.460> see<00:02:07.640> if<00:02:07.729> there's<00:02:07.880> any<00:02:08.030> other

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
check to see if there's any other

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.510 
check to see if there's any other
runners<00:02:08.630> like<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.470> plant<00:02:09.770> here<00:02:10.130> obviously

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
runners like this plant here obviously

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.059 
runners like this plant here obviously
it<00:02:10.940> has<00:02:11.120> two<00:02:11.959> runners<00:02:12.410> coming<00:02:12.860> off<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.459> so

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it has two runners coming off of it so

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.670 
it has two runners coming off of it so
this<00:02:16.069> will<00:02:16.280> make<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.640> explode<00:02:17.090> with<00:02:17.360> growth<00:02:17.680> so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
this will make it explode with growth so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.559 
this will make it explode with growth so
you<00:02:18.709> want<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> prune<00:02:19.790> those<00:02:20.030> runners<00:02:21.250> okay

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
you want to prune those runners okay

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.370 
you want to prune those runners okay
there's<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:23.810> one<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.599> then<00:02:26.930> there's<00:02:27.110> that
