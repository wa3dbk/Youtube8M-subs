go back it just now is not the right

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.740 
go back it just now is not the right
time<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.430> me<00:01:05.489> before<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.150> telling<00:01:06.420> him<00:01:06.540> in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
time for me before you're telling him in

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.890 
time for me before you're telling him in
the<00:01:06.960> WWE<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.830> work<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> part<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.760> WCW<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the WWE you work or as a part of WCW and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.050 
the WWE you work or as a part of WCW and
I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> time<00:01:10.680> fangs<00:01:11.490> had<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I think at that time fangs had it so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
I think at that time fangs had it so
good<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.570> had<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> advantage<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> having<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
good they had the advantage of having a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.520 
good they had the advantage of having a
true<00:01:14.490> rival<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> true<00:01:16.080> competitor

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
true rival and I think a true competitor

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.859 
true rival and I think a true competitor
to<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.979> WWE<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.540> could<00:01:18.750> ever

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
to the WWE do you think that could ever

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.410 
to the WWE do you think that could ever
exist<00:01:19.080> again<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.040> somebody<00:01:20.400> could<00:01:20.520> rise<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
exist again that somebody could rise to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
exist again that somebody could rise to
the<00:01:21.810> WWE's<00:01:22.439> heights<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> can

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the WWE's heights if you know you can

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.149 
the WWE's heights if you know you can
kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> equal<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
kind of equal them and be that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
kind of equal them and be that
legitimate<00:01:27.090> sort<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> competitor<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.259> Vince<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
legitimate sort of competitor to Vince I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
legitimate sort of competitor to Vince I
don't<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.659> it'll<00:01:30.780> ever

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
don't think so I don't think it'll ever

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
don't think so I don't think it'll ever
