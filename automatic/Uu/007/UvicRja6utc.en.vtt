00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.499 

I<00:00:04.339> would<00:00:05.339> say<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.520> most<00:00:05.670> challenging<00:00:06.180> thing

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
I would say the most challenging thing

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.730 
I would say the most challenging thing
would<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.960> been<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.230> stay<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.589> that

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
would have been to stay on that

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.440 
would have been to stay on that
centerline<00:00:08.250> there<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:08.610> lots<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.970> maneuvers

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
centerline there was lots of maneuvers

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.480 
centerline there was lots of maneuvers
that<00:00:09.719> had<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.050> done<00:00:10.260> while<00:00:10.920> being<00:00:11.160> straight

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
that had to be done while being straight

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.209 
that had to be done while being straight
on<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.910> centerline<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.750> when<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> add<00:00:13.769> speed

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
on the centerline and when you add speed

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.150 
on the centerline and when you add speed
into<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.269> when<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.540> add<00:00:16.070> you<00:00:17.070> know

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
into it and when you add you know

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400 
into it and when you add you know
maneuvers<00:00:17.760> lead<00:00:18.029> changes<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.750> braking<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
maneuvers lead changes all braking to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.929 
maneuvers lead changes all braking to
the<00:00:19.500> walk<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.369> adds<00:00:20.550> more

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the walk and all of that just adds more

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
the walk and all of that just adds more
difficulty<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.800> first<00:00:22.800> things<00:00:22.980> first<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
difficulty so first things first was to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910 
difficulty so first things first was to
stay<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.000> good<00:00:24.150> lines<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:25.439> he<00:00:25.800> can

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
stay and have good lines I think he can

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.429 
stay and have good lines I think he can
be<00:00:26.039> over<00:00:26.310> practiced<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:27.750> usually<00:00:28.080> do

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
be over practiced so we don't usually do

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.800 
be over practiced so we don't usually do
that<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.310> rely<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.580> John<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:29.939> Jill<00:00:30.240> my
