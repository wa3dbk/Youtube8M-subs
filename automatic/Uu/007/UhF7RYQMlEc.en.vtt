hello<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:11.970> my<00:00:12.270> little<00:00:12.480> chart<00:00:12.870> on

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
hello this is my little chart on

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.950 
hello this is my little chart on
different<00:00:13.700> injections<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.360> I'm<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
different injections so I'm going to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
different injections so I'm going to
start<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.619> am<00:00:16.860> intramuscular<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.910> that's

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
start with I am intramuscular and that's

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.210 
start with I am intramuscular and that's
the<00:00:18.270> deepest<00:00:18.690> injection<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the deepest injection and you have the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.240 
the deepest injection and you have the
larger<00:00:20.670> syringe<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.070> your

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
larger syringe for it so you have your

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
larger syringe for it so you have your
needle<00:00:23.610> here<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> hub<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.750> comes

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
needle here and then the hub that comes

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.650 
needle here and then the hub that comes
next<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.800> then<00:00:26.250> your<00:00:26.400> syringe<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.210> usually<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
next and then your syringe is usually a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.230 
next and then your syringe is usually a
2<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> 5<00:00:28.289> cc<00:00:28.800> volume<00:00:29.190> this<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.640> happens<00:00:30.030> to<00:00:30.119> be

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
2 to 5 cc volume this one happens to be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.450 
2 to 5 cc volume this one happens to be
3<00:00:30.949> CCS<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.270> milliliters<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.750> another<00:00:34.110> word<00:00:35.100> for

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
3 CCS or milliliters is another word for

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
3 CCS or milliliters is another word for
it<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:36.120> length<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.720> needle<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.440> will

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it the length of the needle here will

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
it the length of the needle here will
usually<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.260> half

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
usually be about one to one and a half

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.370 
usually be about one to one and a half
inch<00:00:40.829> depending<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.510> person<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.200> they're

inch depending on the person if they're
heavier<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> needs<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> longer<00:00:44.670> needle

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
heavier it needs to be a longer needle

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940 
heavier it needs to be a longer needle
or<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.450> they're<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> smaller<00:00:46.260> person<00:00:46.530> needs<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
or if they're a smaller person needs to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.250 
or if they're a smaller person needs to
be<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.340> short<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.239> least<00:00:48.360> 1<00:00:48.750> inch<00:00:48.780> to

be a little short but at least 1 inch to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.670 
be a little short but at least 1 inch to
get<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> into<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> IM<00:00:50.370> area<00:00:51.260> when<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.380> put<00:00:52.559> an

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
get it into the IM area when you put an

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
get it into the IM area when you put an
IM<00:00:53.100> needle<00:00:53.820> into<00:00:54.149> patient<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.050> need<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.770> in

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
IM needle into patient you need to go in

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.209 
IM needle into patient you need to go in
at<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> 90<00:00:56.700> degree<00:00:56.730> angle<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
at a 90 degree angle to get that get it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
at a 90 degree angle to get that get it
into<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.790> intramuscular<00:01:00.570> area<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.230> need

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
into the intramuscular area and you need

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.700 
into the intramuscular area and you need
to<00:01:01.530> splay<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.370> area<00:01:02.670> down<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to splay the area down so you can get it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.910 
to splay the area down so you can get it
into<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.309> deep<00:01:05.489> part<00:01:06.560> going<00:01:07.560> down<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
into the deep part going down to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
into the deep part going down to
subcutaneous<00:01:08.850> Oh<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.690> here<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> am

subcutaneous Oh up here on the I am
three<00:01:11.460> CCS<00:01:11.910> has<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.300> maximum<00:01:12.510> volume<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
three CCS has the maximum volume that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
three CCS has the maximum volume that
you<00:01:14.190> should<00:01:14.400> give<00:01:14.610> someone<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you should give someone because if you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.570 
you should give someone because if you
give<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:15.960> than<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:17.010> to<00:01:17.100> cause

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
give more than that it's going to cause

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.020 
give more than that it's going to cause
scarring<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> area<00:01:19.340> subcutaneous<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
scarring in that area subcutaneous is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
scarring in that area subcutaneous is
next<00:01:21.710> we'll<00:01:22.710> look<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.010> here<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> syringe

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
next we'll look over here the syringe

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.469 
next we'll look over here the syringe
volumes<00:01:24.390> are<00:01:24.600> 1<00:01:24.840> 2<00:01:25.170> &amp;<00:01:25.200> 3<00:01:25.439> cc<00:01:26.100> syringe<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.299> it's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
volumes are 1 2 &amp; 3 cc syringe so it's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.500 
volumes are 1 2 &amp; 3 cc syringe so it's
more<00:01:27.750> superficial<00:01:28.650> than<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> am<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.299> it's

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
more superficial than the I am and it's

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.840 
more superficial than the I am and it's
less<00:01:30.810> medicine<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.640> also

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
less medicine that can go in you also

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.929 
less medicine that can go in you also
see<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> needle<00:01:33.840> length<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.320> less<00:01:35.010> it's<00:01:35.820> going

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
see the needle length is less it's going

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.480 
see the needle length is less it's going
to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.180> smaller<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.170> needle<00:01:37.470> gauge<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
to be smaller in the needle gauge it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.640 
to be smaller in the needle gauge it's
going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> tinier<00:01:39.840> too

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
going to be tinier too

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.550 
going to be tinier too
so<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.580> three<00:01:42.030> CC<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.780> milliliter

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so this is up to three CC or milliliter

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.330 
so this is up to three CC or milliliter
and<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.430> smaller<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.950> smaller

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and this is a smaller one to the smaller

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.969 
and this is a smaller one to the smaller
one<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> used

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
one can be used

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
one can be used
maybe<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:51.979> allergy<00:01:52.979> testing<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
maybe for some allergy testing when you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.859 
maybe for some allergy testing when you
do<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.290> subcutaneous<00:01:55.850> you're<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.600> in

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
do a subcutaneous you're going to go in

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840 
do a subcutaneous you're going to go in
at<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> ninety<00:01:58.500> degree<00:01:58.530> angle<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> very

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
at a ninety degree angle for a very

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.870 
at a ninety degree angle for a very
short<00:01:59.909> needle<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:01.020> 45<00:02:01.619> degree<00:02:02.070> angle<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.850> a

short needle or a 45 degree angle for a
longer<00:02:03.329> needle<00:02:04.340> coming<00:02:05.340> over<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> insulin

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
longer needle coming over to the insulin

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
longer needle coming over to the insulin
you<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.049> pretty<00:02:07.409> tiny<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:08.880> an

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you see it's pretty tiny and it has an

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.330 
you see it's pretty tiny and it has an
orange<00:02:09.420> cap

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
orange cap

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.259 
orange cap
it<00:02:10.550> comes<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.180> units<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:12.610> usually<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.970> needle

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
it comes in units and usually the needle

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.640 
it comes in units and usually the needle
is<00:02:14.480> non-detachable

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
is non-detachable

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.009 
is non-detachable
so<00:02:16.580> when<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.940> give<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.269> someone<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.840> usually

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
so when you give in someone you usually

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.550 
so when you give in someone you usually
give<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.590> sub-q<00:02:19.870> 90-degree<00:02:20.870> angle<00:02:21.230> because

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
give it sub-q 90-degree angle because

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.610 
give it sub-q 90-degree angle because
it's<00:02:21.590> such<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> short<00:02:22.250> needle<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.330> then<00:02:24.319> down

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
it's such a short needle and then down

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.309 
it's such a short needle and then down
here<00:02:24.879> intradermal<00:02:25.879> intradermal<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.930> usually

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
here intradermal intradermal is usually

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.940 
here intradermal intradermal is usually
given<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.299> TB<00:02:29.299> skin<00:02:29.690> test<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.379> that's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
given for a TB skin test and that's

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.460 
given for a TB skin test and that's
about<00:02:31.250> five<00:02:31.819> -<00:02:32.480> oh<00:02:33.700> maybe<00:02:34.700> ten<00:02:35.180> degree<00:02:36.019> angle

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
about five - oh maybe ten degree angle

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.539 
about five - oh maybe ten degree angle
and<00:02:36.950> it's<00:02:37.580> comes<00:02:38.150> in<00:02:38.330> milliliters<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.549> you

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
and it's comes in milliliters and you

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.990 
and it's comes in milliliters and you
just<00:02:40.910> give<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.720> very<00:02:42.049> very<00:02:42.290> superficially<00:02:43.280> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
just give it very very superficially and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000 
just give it very very superficially and
then<00:02:44.180> down<00:02:44.420> here<00:02:44.450> I'll<00:02:44.959> put<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:45.739> so

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
then down here I'll put this on here so

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.089 
then down here I'll put this on here so
you<00:02:46.040> can<00:02:46.430> see<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:48.200> flush<00:02:48.860> if

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
you can see that this is for flush if

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.280 
you can see that this is for flush if
you<00:02:49.220> give<00:02:49.400> an<00:02:49.549> IV<00:02:49.790> medication<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.989> need<00:02:51.140> to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
you give an IV medication you need to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.380 
you give an IV medication you need to
flush<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.590> before<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.640> after<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.180> give<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
flush it before and after you give the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.460 
flush it before and after you give the
IV<00:02:53.900> medication<00:02:55.660> coming<00:02:56.660> back<00:02:56.810> over<00:02:57.019> here<00:02:57.140> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
IV medication coming back over here to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.920 
IV medication coming back over here to
the<00:02:57.590> TB<00:03:00.190> point<00:03:01.190> two<00:03:01.700> milliliters<00:03:02.209> it's<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
the TB point two milliliters it's the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.589 
the TB point two milliliters it's the
maximum<00:03:03.379> Med<00:03:03.769> volume<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.519> can<00:03:04.760> give<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
maximum Med volume that you can give and

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.990 
maximum Med volume that you can give and
up<00:03:06.110> here<00:03:06.319> for<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.650> FQ<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.879> a<00:03:07.970> half

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
up here for this FQ is one and a half

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.660 
up here for this FQ is one and a half
milliliters<00:03:08.840> as<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.260> max<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.769> give<00:03:10.129> so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
milliliters as the max you can give so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.490 
milliliters as the max you can give so
if<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.910> remember<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:12.769> M<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.519> three<00:03:14.200> sub<00:03:15.200> q

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
if you remember that I M is three sub q

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.160 
if you remember that I M is three sub q
is<00:03:15.650> half<00:03:15.889> of<00:03:16.069> three<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.940> half<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.480> then

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
is half of three one and a half and then

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.670 
is half of three one and a half and then
your<00:03:18.650> intradermal<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.670> point<00:03:20.060> two<00:03:20.440> down<00:03:21.440> here

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
your intradermal is point two down here

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.940 
your intradermal is point two down here
you<00:03:21.799> can<00:03:21.950> see<00:03:22.130> sizes<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.910> volumes<00:03:23.299> may<00:03:23.630> vary

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
you can see sizes and volumes may vary

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.190 
you can see sizes and volumes may vary
if<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.220> patient<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.760> larger<00:03:26.299> or<00:03:26.359> smaller<00:03:26.450> than

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
if the patient is larger or smaller than

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.379 
if the patient is larger or smaller than
average<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.549> kind<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.849> varies<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.180> little

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
average so it kind of varies a little

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.270 
average so it kind of varies a little
bit<00:03:29.540> with<00:03:29.780> your<00:03:29.870> patient<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.889> kind

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
bit with your patient but this is kind

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.610 
bit with your patient but this is kind
of<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.549> general<00:03:31.970> description<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.230> remember

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
of a general description and remember

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.460 
of a general description and remember

with your I am sometimes you need to do
a<00:03:36.500> C<00:03:36.799> track<00:03:37.130> method<00:03:37.639> where<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.269> pull<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.139> skin

a C track method where you pull the skin
over<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.950> side<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.579> there's<00:03:41.150> no<00:03:41.359> tracking

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
over to the side so there's no tracking

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.659 
over to the side so there's no tracking
