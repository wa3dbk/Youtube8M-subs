where it won't slip on wet grass which
is<00:03:24.660> what<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:24.900> contending<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.410> right<00:03:25.709> now<00:03:25.739> is

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
is what I'm contending with right now is

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.560 
is what I'm contending with right now is
what's<00:03:26.580> grass<00:03:29.150> then<00:03:30.150> you're<00:03:30.270> just<00:03:30.360> going<00:03:30.540> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
what's grass then you're just going to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.090 
what's grass then you're just going to
take<00:03:30.750> your<00:03:30.900> slab<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:32.400> set<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.270> in<00:03:33.390> here

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
take your slab and set it in here

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.170 
take your slab and set it in here
and<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.190> might<00:03:35.310> have<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.580> adjust<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:36.060> little

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and you might have to adjust a little

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.090 
and you might have to adjust a little
bit<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.040> you're<00:03:38.340> going<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.489> set<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.850> evenly

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
bit and you're going to set it evenly

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.880 
bit and you're going to set it evenly
dispersed<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.520> those<00:03:41.850> three<00:03:42.120> legs<00:03:42.680> just<00:03:43.680> like

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
dispersed on those three legs just like

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.580 
dispersed on those three legs just like
this

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.470 

so<00:03:48.340> if<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.520> built<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:48.910> right<00:03:51.120> I'm<00:03:52.120> not<00:03:52.330> going

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
so if I built this right I'm not going

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.670 
so if I built this right I'm not going
to<00:03:52.540> hit<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.660> ground<00:03:52.959> when<00:03:53.080> I<00:03:53.140> set<00:03:53.349> my<00:03:53.380> butt<00:03:53.650> on

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
to hit the ground when I set my butt on

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.790 
to hit the ground when I set my butt on
it<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:55.239> easy<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.660> move<00:03:55.810> around<00:03:56.110> it's<00:03:56.470> easy<00:03:56.620> to

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
it it's easy to move around it's easy to

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.130 
it it's easy to move around it's easy to
move<00:03:57.130> around<00:03:57.250> camp<00:03:57.730> some<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> camp<00:03:58.870> chairs

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
move around camp some of the camp chairs

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.540 
move around camp some of the camp chairs
and<00:03:59.349> things<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.530> I've<00:03:59.680> seen<00:03:59.830> me<00:04:00.040> with<00:04:00.220> tarps

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
and things that I've seen me with tarps

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.309 
and things that I've seen me with tarps
and<00:04:00.760> hammocks<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.750> all<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.080> business

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
and hammocks and all that business

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.320 
and hammocks and all that business
require<00:04:02.800> big<00:04:03.040> tripods<00:04:03.550> and<00:04:03.760> things<00:04:04.030> in<00:04:04.180> their

require big tripods and things in their

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.290 
require big tripods and things in their
opinion<00:04:05.200> -<00:04:05.290> but<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.560> move<00:04:05.680> around<00:04:05.830> camp<00:04:06.300> this

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
opinion - but to move around camp this

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.940 
opinion - but to move around camp this
is<00:04:07.480> real<00:04:07.660> easy<00:04:07.959> move<00:04:08.110> around<00:04:08.319> camp<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.830> got

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
is real easy move around camp if you got

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.800 
is real easy move around camp if you got
wet<00:04:09.160> grass<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:10.120> might<00:04:10.269> have<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.480> pound<00:04:10.690> the

now<00:04:21.130> let<00:04:22.120> me<00:04:22.240> show<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.450> how<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.200> cut<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.590> slab

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.700 

okay<00:04:27.639> for<00:04:27.880> sake<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.120> this<00:04:28.360> quick<00:04:28.690> stump<00:04:29.470> top

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
okay for sake of this quick stump top

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.190 
okay for sake of this quick stump top
demonstration<00:04:30.460> we're<00:04:30.580> going<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:31.020> say<00:04:32.020> that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
demonstration we're going to say that

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.990 
demonstration we're going to say that
this<00:04:32.290> log<00:04:32.620> is<00:04:32.860> completely<00:04:33.370> round<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:33.940> it

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
this log is completely round and it

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.330 
this log is completely round and it
hasn't<00:04:34.240> been<00:04:34.300> cut<00:04:34.510> off<00:04:34.860> that's<00:04:35.860> no<00:04:36.100> big<00:04:36.310> deal

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
hasn't been cut off that's no big deal

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.110 
hasn't been cut off that's no big deal
if<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.270> was<00:04:37.470> round<00:04:38.470> here<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.250> around<00:04:39.460> here<00:04:39.850> it

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
if it was round here and around here it

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.430 
if it was round here and around here it
would<00:04:40.240> be<00:04:40.330> better<00:04:40.510> it'd<00:04:40.690> be<00:04:40.810> more<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.110> slab

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
would be better it'd be more like a slab

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.219 
would be better it'd be more like a slab
we've<00:04:41.620> got<00:04:41.770> on<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.889> chair<00:04:42.160> but<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.330> concept<00:04:44.110> is

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
we've got on a chair but the concept is

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.350 
we've got on a chair but the concept is
exactly<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.830> same<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.310> I've<00:04:45.400> got<00:04:45.580> my<00:04:45.760> raw<00:04:46.000> log

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
exactly the same so I've got my raw log

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.900 
exactly the same so I've got my raw log
that<00:04:47.080> I've<00:04:47.229> cut<00:04:47.500> off<00:04:47.710> laying<00:04:48.520> here<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.820> this

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
that I've cut off laying here and this

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.570 
that I've cut off laying here and this
is<00:04:49.060> again<00:04:49.419> where<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> bow<00:04:50.290> saw<00:04:50.530> comes<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:51.010> you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
is again where the bow saw comes in you

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.640 
is again where the bow saw comes in you
know<00:04:51.640> this<00:04:51.820> is<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.970> lot<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.180> work<00:04:52.510> with<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.229> pocket

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.090 
log so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.840> go<00:05:13.990> in<00:05:14.140> here<00:05:14.229> with<00:05:14.350> our<00:05:14.500> saw<00:05:14.740> and

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
going to go in here with our saw and

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.640 
going to go in here with our saw and
again<00:05:15.640> if<00:05:15.880> I<00:05:16.060> had<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.300> bow<00:05:16.630> saw<00:05:16.930> will<00:05:17.350> be<00:05:17.470> much

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
again if I had a bow saw will be much

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.520 
again if I had a bow saw will be much
better<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:19.210> let's<00:05:19.450> say<00:05:19.570> we<00:05:19.750> want<00:05:19.960> our<00:05:20.110> seat<00:05:20.380> to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
better so let's say we want our seat to

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.100 
better so let's say we want our seat to
be<00:05:20.680> you<00:05:20.979> know<00:05:21.130> yay<00:05:21.400> wide<00:05:21.669> for<00:05:22.479> demonstration

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
be you know yay wide for demonstration

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.100 
be you know yay wide for demonstration
purposes<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.800> would<00:05:24.310> take<00:05:24.520> my<00:05:24.700> saw<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.570> cut

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
purposes I would take my saw and cut

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.090 
purposes I would take my saw and cut
down<00:05:26.380> into<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:27.100> log<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:28.419> depth<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:29.169> I<00:05:29.740> want

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
down into that log the depth that I want

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.600 
down into that log the depth that I want
that<00:05:30.280> slab<00:05:30.639> to<00:05:30.820> come<00:05:31.000> off<00:05:32.039> and<00:05:33.039> again<00:05:33.280> this<00:05:33.430> may

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
that slab to come off and again this may

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.100 
that slab to come off and again this may
take<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:33.880> few<00:05:33.970> minutes<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.450> cut<00:05:34.660> down<00:05:34.810> through

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
take a few minutes to cut down through

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.800 
take a few minutes to cut down through
here<00:05:35.260> with<00:05:35.800> this<00:05:36.010> saw

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
here with this saw

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.290 
here with this saw
so<00:05:38.810> I'll<00:05:38.960> spare<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.700> misery<00:05:40.700> of<00:05:40.760> watching

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
so I'll spare you the misery of watching

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.540 
so I'll spare you the misery of watching
me<00:05:41.450> cuts<00:05:42.140> cut<00:05:42.830> through<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.160> thing<00:05:43.370> because

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
me cuts cut through this thing because

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.680 
me cuts cut through this thing because
that's<00:05:43.610> probably<00:05:43.910> like<00:05:44.030> watching<00:05:44.390> paint<00:05:44.570> dry

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
that's probably like watching paint dry

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.910 
that's probably like watching paint dry
when<00:05:45.530> I<00:05:45.560> get<00:05:45.710> a<00:05:45.740> cut<00:05:45.980> down<00:05:46.160> we'll<00:05:46.340> come<00:05:46.490> back

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.880 

okay<00:05:51.920> so<00:05:51.980> once<00:05:52.400> we've<00:05:52.580> got<00:05:52.820> our<00:05:53.500> cut<00:05:54.500> in<00:05:54.650> here

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
okay so once we've got our cut in here

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.710 
okay so once we've got our cut in here
and<00:05:55.340> I<00:05:55.400> wouldn't<00:05:55.610> got<00:05:55.760> a<00:05:55.790> bigger<00:05:56.000> saw<00:05:56.240> say<00:05:56.510> that

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
and I wouldn't got a bigger saw say that

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.560 
and I wouldn't got a bigger saw say that
right<00:05:56.900> now<00:05:57.610> once<00:05:58.610> we've<00:05:58.760> got<00:05:58.880> our<00:05:58.910> cut<00:05:59.240> made<00:05:59.420> in

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
right now once we've got our cut made in

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.300 
right now once we've got our cut made in
here<00:05:59.750> it<00:06:00.200> becomes<00:06:00.560> really<00:06:00.770> simple<00:06:01.220> all<00:06:01.280> we

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
here it becomes really simple all we

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.690 
here it becomes really simple all we
need<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:01.580> do<00:06:01.760> is<00:06:02.000> split<00:06:02.420> this<00:06:02.720> off<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.740> side<00:06:03.980> so

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
need to do is split this off the side so

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.750 
need to do is split this off the side so
if<00:06:05.000> we've<00:06:05.240> got<00:06:05.420> this<00:06:05.540> log<00:06:05.840> laying<00:06:06.170> on<00:06:06.290> the<00:06:06.350> side

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
if we've got this log laying on the side

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.550 
if we've got this log laying on the side
then<00:06:07.760> we're<00:06:07.910> going<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.180> hit<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:08.930> with<00:06:09.050> our<00:06:09.290> axe

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
then we're going to hit it with our axe

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.880 
then we're going to hit it with our axe
right<00:06:09.860> here<00:06:10.160> and<00:06:10.310> split<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:11.030> plank<00:06:11.360> off<00:06:11.890> we

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
right here and split that plank off we

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.650 
right here and split that plank off we
can<00:06:13.040> always<00:06:13.250> hit<00:06:13.400> it<00:06:13.490> here<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:14.270> split<00:06:14.540> that

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
can always hit it here to split that

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.780 
can always hit it here to split that
plank<00:06:14.990> off<00:06:15.200> or<00:06:15.470> hit<00:06:15.590> it<00:06:15.620> here<00:06:15.980> and<00:06:16.340> split<00:06:16.640> that

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
plank off or hit it here and split that

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.610 
plank off or hit it here and split that
plank<00:06:17.060> off<00:06:17.270> but<00:06:18.050> if<00:06:18.140> it's<00:06:18.230> laying<00:06:18.380> on<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
plank off but if it's laying on the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.440 
plank off but if it's laying on the
ground<00:06:18.920> it's<00:06:19.640> easier<00:06:20.000> to<00:06:20.090> do<00:06:20.210> it<00:06:20.240> from<00:06:20.300> the

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
ground it's easier to do it from the

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.790 
ground it's easier to do it from the
front<00:06:20.480> then<00:06:20.840> you<00:06:20.960> can<00:06:21.080> use<00:06:21.170> a<00:06:21.200> wooden<00:06:21.410> wedge<00:06:21.620> if

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
front then you can use a wooden wedge if

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.320 
front then you can use a wooden wedge if
you<00:06:21.890> need<00:06:22.040> to<00:06:22.160> as<00:06:22.310> well<00:06:22.520> now<00:06:23.030> if<00:06:23.090> you<00:06:23.150> had<00:06:23.270> a

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
you need to as well now if you had a

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.390 
you need to as well now if you had a
piece<00:06:23.540> that<00:06:23.570> you'd<00:06:23.780> cut<00:06:24.020> out<00:06:24.230> of<00:06:24.560> a<00:06:24.920> log<00:06:25.160> like

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
piece that you'd cut out of a log like

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.210 
piece that you'd cut out of a log like
this<00:06:25.670> then<00:06:26.480> you<00:06:26.570> can<00:06:26.690> just<00:06:26.870> stand<00:06:27.050> on<00:06:27.230> side<00:06:27.560> and

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
this then you can just stand on side and

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.710 
this then you can just stand on side and
split<00:06:28.580> that<00:06:28.700> off<00:06:28.760> with<00:06:29.060> your<00:06:29.210> axe<00:06:29.420> and<00:06:29.630> it

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
split that off with your axe and it

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.780 
split that off with your axe and it
should<00:06:29.870> come<00:06:30.050> off<00:06:30.080> pretty<00:06:30.320> easy<00:06:30.650> either<00:06:31.490> way

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
should come off pretty easy either way

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.280 
should come off pretty easy either way
all<00:06:32.120> you're<00:06:32.510> gonna<00:06:32.600> have<00:06:32.690> to<00:06:32.870> do<00:06:32.990> is<00:06:33.080> split

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
all you're gonna have to do is split

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.050 
all you're gonna have to do is split
that<00:06:33.470> off<00:06:33.530> with<00:06:33.830> your<00:06:33.950> axe<00:06:34.160> and<00:06:34.700> you<00:06:34.760> should

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
that off with your axe and you should

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.620 
that off with your axe and you should
get<00:06:35.270> what<00:06:35.420> you're<00:06:35.540> looking<00:06:35.810> for

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
get what you're looking for

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.520 
get what you're looking for
we're<00:06:38.630> just<00:06:38.750> got<00:06:38.840> to<00:06:38.930> hit<00:06:39.020> in<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.170> right<00:06:39.290> spot

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
we're just got to hit in the right spot

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.520 
we're just got to hit in the right spot
first<00:06:42.730> just<00:06:43.730> like<00:06:43.880> that<00:06:44.150> and<00:06:44.720> that<00:06:45.260> gives<00:06:45.470> us

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
first just like that and that gives us

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.740 
first just like that and that gives us
our<00:06:45.710> slap<00:06:46.040> and<00:06:46.370> then<00:06:46.730> we<00:06:46.850> can<00:06:46.970> clean<00:06:47.240> that<00:06:47.270> slab

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
our slap and then we can clean that slab

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.710 
our slap and then we can clean that slab
up<00:06:48.790> with<00:06:49.790> our<00:06:49.940> knife<00:06:50.120> or<00:06:50.300> whatever<00:06:50.420> the<00:06:50.540> case

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
up with our knife or whatever the case

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.540 
up with our knife or whatever the case
may<00:06:50.900> be<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:51.350> make<00:06:51.830> our<00:06:52.040> seat<00:06:52.280> and<00:06:52.430> that's

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
may be to make our seat and that's

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.630 
may be to make our seat and that's
really<00:06:52.820> big<00:06:53.000> enough<00:06:53.270> for<00:06:53.510> a<00:06:54.020> seat<00:06:54.320> right<00:06:54.530> there

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
really big enough for a seat right there

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.620 
really big enough for a seat right there
the<00:06:55.640> other<00:06:55.790> one<00:06:55.850> I<00:06:56.000> have<00:06:56.030> was<00:06:56.300> just<00:06:56.480> a<00:06:56.540> little

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
the other one I have was just a little

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.180 
the other one I have was just a little
bit<00:06:56.810> bigger<00:06:57.050> that<00:06:57.200> I<00:06:57.230> was<00:06:57.380> working<00:06:57.530> with<00:06:57.800> but

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
bit bigger that I was working with but
