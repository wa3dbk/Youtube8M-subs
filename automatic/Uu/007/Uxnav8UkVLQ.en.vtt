00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
flip it over obviously you have this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.279 
flip it over obviously you have this
eing<00:01:07.610> display<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.300> e-ink<00:01:08.509> is<00:01:08.929> really

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
eing display and the e-ink is really

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.700 
eing display and the e-ink is really
interesting<00:01:09.710> because<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.160> consumes<00:01:11.119> no<00:01:11.390> power

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
interesting because it consumes no power

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.600 
interesting because it consumes no power
when<00:01:12.710> it's<00:01:12.890> just<00:01:13.070> static

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
when it's just static

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.210 
when it's just static
only<00:01:14.090> when<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.929> replay<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.679> display<00:01:16.039> gets

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
only when the replay the display gets

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.770 
only when the replay the display gets
refreshed<00:01:16.729> which<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.420> really<00:01:17.630> interesting

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
refreshed which is really interesting

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.809 
refreshed which is really interesting
because<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:18.380> means<00:01:18.679> this<00:01:18.920> phone<00:01:19.160> can<00:01:19.369> go<00:01:19.550> on

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819

there's LTE bands on this device but

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.379 
there's LTE bands on this device but
they're<00:04:48.220> not<00:04:48.340> compatible<00:04:48.669> with<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.120> u.s.

they're not compatible with the u.s.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.510 
they're not compatible with the u.s.
obviously<00:04:49.900> if<00:04:50.350> it<00:04:50.440> comes<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.919> u.s.<00:04:51.160> it

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
obviously if it comes to the u.s. it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.360 
obviously if it comes to the u.s. it
will<00:04:51.669> have<00:04:51.880> LTE<00:04:52.470> capability<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.130> if<00:04:54.250> it

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
will have LTE capability and so if it

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.690 
will have LTE capability and so if it
does<00:04:54.520> have<00:04:54.700> LTE<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.870> expect<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.860> it<00:04:57.400> will<00:04:57.550> be

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
does have LTE I expect that it will be

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.879 
does have LTE I expect that it will be
compatible<00:04:57.940> with<00:04:58.240> AT&amp;T<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.810> t-mobile<00:04:59.020> etc<00:04:59.710> or

compatible with AT&amp;T and t-mobile etc or

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.540 
compatible with AT&amp;T and t-mobile etc or
maybe<00:05:00.639> they'll<00:05:00.880> work<00:05:01.150> out<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.330> carrier<00:05:01.780> deal

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
