00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.580
 very good to all how good you are 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.930
 Well, we're here in another video 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.690
 tutorial 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.360
 and this time how to teach you to play 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.360
 tourism 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.680
 13 online for that we will need this 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.260
 Program 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.950
 it's the march because we make it 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:25.060
 download or we open it and what 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.750
 we turn on and here one has to create a 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.770
 server 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 it is created so we can create a new network 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.270
 and we call it for example 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.720
 when he teaches 23 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.290
 and we created it and then the others have 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.290
 to put an existing message 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.289
 I have put 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.289
 Market Stall 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.880
 OK 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.680
 and for this program by this part already 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.360
 is done then we would have to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.960
 doing something else is progress from the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.760
 game so now we look good because 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.680
 As you can see, I have the game of Carlism 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.460
 started and what you have to do now 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.010
 is to put the ttt or own hand that is 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.770
 change so before it is in sandbox and 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.260
 to convince the new game we take 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.479
 the ante itself and we put anybody 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.900
 of the maps this for example e 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.950
 we started the game 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.950
 but we will fix it 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.790
 loading calm 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.480
 it takes little 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.480
 it's practically 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.940
 we give you a click 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.810
 what we want to be and haunted I put 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.240
 all 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.100
 now we put all lost because no 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 there was nobody playing we waited a little 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.570
 although the game starts 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.560
 and we're here now if we want to join 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.630
 the game we have to press f10 and here 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.880
 in the console that I can not write 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.700
 because I'm recording with a program 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.300
 who tries and does not let me put 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.620
 connect 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.210
 with two genes separation and the ip that 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.240
 we had already recorded 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.600
 and with this you can already accept and it's not a 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.580
 the game that is 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.160
 created by the other 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.310
 and good 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.110
 this is all, see you later 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 one thing that I had forgotten before 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.040
 to start with the game you have to 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.150
 put here the players that you are going to 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.670
 do if you are 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.670
 credits and server name 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.720
 I hope it serves them and if anyone 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.720
 portable game ask what
