00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.220
 When you think about the tooth they think you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 very quickly your stuff goes to floor 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.820
 happenin 'farmers but nowadays 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.460
 made the dentist really nobody 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.200
 teeth our kind of dental designer 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.200
 it also happens here dental costs 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.600
 especially what I used to think 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.279
 if your teeth are broken for centuries it is not 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.470
 can do more through the I no longer 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.090
 would not be more happy nowadays 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.009
 we can be broken like a tooth 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.560
 we could do that well 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.820
 recover with each other even though 10:09 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
 very precise greenness of what for 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.270
 material we make a crown out of 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 porcelain and porcelain that is one 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.910
 material it leads saint on its own 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.700
 tooth enamel 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.050
 is almost the same color and we can 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.730
 we can do that nowadays 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.829
 clearly aesthetic 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.870
 give shape so that it is perfect for the patient 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.070
 against every tooth or choose now 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.110
 crown plate 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.780
 but basically as the foundation 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.370
 if the root is good then we can go in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.030
 principle on every tooth or molar we can 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.860
 croma 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.660
 even on wisdom teeth and what is then 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.520
 the difference between a crown and back 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.739
 as we all know it will be 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.150
 be drawn once again teeth than 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.920
 the foundation is gone 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.720
 if we are then by hour elements are the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.780
 teeth next to the hole then we can do that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.640
 then we can stalk the crown and shape 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.229
 We have, as it were three teeth 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 each other and we call that a bridge 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.560
 can see dates want to see yes I have some what 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.190
 prepared 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.020
 this is an example of this 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.250
 a crown a tooth and color of one's own 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.140
 teeth 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.910
 this is such an example of a carrot 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.050
 This is then no real being put on 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.270
 plastic root 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.650
 well that against I will be normal there 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.910
 spoken it used to be so than it had to 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.040
 make your prints 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.260
 happen that an animal went to print 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.150
 to the dental laboratory 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.100
 they then made the crown for us and that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.750
 was introduced to the patient two weeks later 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.150
 put in the mouth but nowadays 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.710
 fortunately we no longer have to bite 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.540
 we can now with a special camera 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.400
 we can scan in the mouth to all 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.990
 collect data 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.970
 and so we can still have a crown 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.970
 using computers 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.600
 and these techniques are still here in one 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.370
 initial phase or has it been real for a long time 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.870
 further developed this technique that is there 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.400
 already 30 years 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.470
 And we can say that we are 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.230
 accurately predictable 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.880
 teeth can recover with crowns and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.200
 it tells you to restore everything else 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.300
 I can imagine that because of that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.280
 follow people think yes then I need him 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.630
 would be the best by previous this year anyway 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.310
 we see that dentists prefer 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.450
 otherwise we would like people to be two 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.500
 brushing once a day 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.480
 also between the teeth and the molars 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.040
 cleaning but also likes it if 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.400
 teeth when patients pay attention to them 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400
 food 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.560
