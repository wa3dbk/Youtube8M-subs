00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
more convenient and this the satellite

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
more convenient and this the satellite
navigation<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.790> integrated<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.570> bit

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
navigation is integrated a little bit

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.149 
navigation is integrated a little bit
better<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.130> I

2010 speed three the tech package

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
2010 speed three the tech package
definitely<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.500> controls<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.549> the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you're solid in the sea we

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.390 
you're solid in the sea we
when<00:02:08.930> this<00:02:09.050> car<00:02:09.290> takes<00:02:09.530> off<00:02:09.680> down<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.100> down

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
when this car takes off down the down

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.280 
when this car takes off down the down
the<00:02:10.550> road<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.270> need<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.840> need<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.110> feel

solid<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:12.920> your<00:02:13.040> seat<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.430> think<00:02:13.790> one<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
solid in your seat I think one of the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.020 
solid in your seat I think one of the
big<00:02:14.870> things<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.350> we<00:02:15.500> kind<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.340> overlooked<00:02:16.910> is

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
big things that we kind of overlooked is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.850 
big things that we kind of overlooked is
the<00:02:17.060> fact<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.480> even<00:02:18.410> with<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:18.710> this

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the fact that even with all this

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.620 
the fact that even with all this
convenience<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.820> creature<00:02:20.060> comforts

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
convenience and the creature comforts

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.410 
convenience and the creature comforts
and<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> state<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:22.160> still<00:02:22.490> very<00:02:22.670> sporting<00:02:23.210> car

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and the state is still very sporting car

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.680 
and the state is still very sporting car
to<00:02:23.570> drive<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.230> for<00:02:25.130> me<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.310> combination<00:02:26.150> of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
to drive and for me that combination of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.960 
to drive and for me that combination of
function<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.770> performance<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.730> really

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
function and performance is really

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.850 
function and performance is really
important<00:02:29.420> especially<00:02:30.140> considering<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
important especially considering the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.340 
important especially considering the
price<00:02:31.010> point<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.580> placed<00:02:31.790> at<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
price point that it's placed at for the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.660 
price point that it's placed at for the
money<00:02:33.530> there's<00:02:33.770> probably<00:02:34.040> not<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.220> better<00:02:34.430> deal

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
money there's probably not a better deal

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.000 
money there's probably not a better deal
in<00:02:34.850> terms<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.150> performance<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.780> space<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
in terms of performance and space in the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.920 
in terms of performance and space in the
car<00:02:37.220> yeah<00:02:37.910> they're<00:02:38.240> they're<00:02:38.420> actually<00:02:38.900> really

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
car yeah they're they're actually really

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.870 
car yeah they're they're actually really
smart<00:02:39.260> with<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> design<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.370> car<00:02:40.640> not

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
smart with the design of this car not

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.780 
smart with the design of this car not
only<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.300> have<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:42.400> interior<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.550> sound

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
only do you have the interior the sound

only do you have the interior the sound
system<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.240> great<00:02:44.420> it's<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.660> Bose<00:02:44.840> sound<00:02:45.140> system

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
system is great it's a Bose sound system

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.350

and they put the subwoofer right into
the<00:02:47.450> spare<00:02:47.690> tire<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.160> they<00:02:49.550> maximize<00:02:50.060> all<00:02:50.300> use

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
the spare tire so they maximize all use

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.970 
the spare tire so they maximize all use
in<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.870> trunk<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.530> also<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
in the trunk you also have the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.460 
in the trunk you also have the
convenience<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> 60<00:02:53.300> 40<00:02:53.540> split<00:02:53.660> seats<00:02:54.170> and

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
those you can lower down as well to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330 
those you can lower down as well to
increase<00:02:56.720> your<00:02:56.750> space<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:58.040> can<00:02:58.160> see<00:02:58.310> that
