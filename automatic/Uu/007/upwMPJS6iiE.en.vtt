00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
safety Acura engineers have stiffened up

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.759

the<00:03:55.099> chassis<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.699> body<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.449> ILX<00:03:56.900> an<00:03:57.169> added

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
the chassis and body of the ILX an added

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.099 
the chassis and body of the ILX an added

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
side benefit of that is greater handling

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.050 
side benefit of that is greater handling
now<00:04:00.560> that's<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:00.980> one<00:04:01.099> area<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.549> ILX<00:04:01.879> was

now that's the one area of the ILX was
always<00:04:02.329> pretty<00:04:02.540> good<00:04:02.629> at<00:04:02.810> but<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.349> am<00:04:03.500> one<00:04:03.709> to

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
feel isn't good it's just it was always

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.770 
feel isn't good it's just it was always
good<00:04:13.519> so<00:04:13.849> if<00:04:14.060> they<00:04:14.120> haven't<00:04:14.359> really<00:04:14.540> made<00:04:14.660> it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
good so if they haven't really made it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.349 
good so if they haven't really made it
any<00:04:14.930> better<00:04:15.130> but<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.489> luxury<00:04:16.760> car<00:04:17.120> and

two<00:04:21.380> minutes<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.859> notice<00:04:22.160> just<00:04:22.280> how<00:04:22.550> much

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
two minutes to notice just how much
