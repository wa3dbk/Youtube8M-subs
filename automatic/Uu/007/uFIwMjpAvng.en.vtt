00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.539 
but I mean I always thought I took that
as<00:01:33.990> being<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> bite<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> 87<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> was

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
as being the bite of 87 you know it was

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
as being the bite of 87 you know it was
fredbear<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:36.990> him<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> looked

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
fredbear he bit him he kind of looked

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
fredbear he bit him he kind of looked
like<00:01:38.189> he<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.520> dead<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.900> kind<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
like he was dead but we just kind of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
like he was dead but we just kind of
took<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.250> he<00:01:41.490> bit<00:01:41.790> off

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
took it that that you know he bit off

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
took it that that you know he bit off
his<00:01:42.000> frontal<00:01:42.270> lobe<00:01:42.329> somehow<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.229> know

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
his frontal lobe somehow and you know

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
his frontal lobe somehow and you know
with<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.009> stuff<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> medical<00:01:44.640> supplies

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
with all this stuff the medical supplies

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
with all this stuff the medical supplies
by<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> bed<00:01:45.420> maybe<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.770> his

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
by the bed maybe this was just like his

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
by the bed maybe this was just like his
recovery<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.520> he<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.060> insane

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
recovery and he was kind of going insane

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.469
