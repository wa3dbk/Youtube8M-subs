00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.910
H-Hey... she can't joke about what she has just said.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.270
Saori's spirits are obviously down, could it be that Kuroneko's eyes are also a little wet after hearing that?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.170
H-Hey... she can't joke about what she has just said.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.770
Hey, stop it, Kirino. These two people are here today just for you.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.690
■ 'New Me' ■
Hey, stop it, Kirino. These two people are here today just for you.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.270
Hey, stop it, Kirino. These two people are here today just for you.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:20.010
It's not like I've asked them to. Furthermore, could you tell me in advance if we're meeting such disgusting people?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.940
Tch... this girl, is she still being stubborn?

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.140
Are those your heartfelt words... by the current 'new you'?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040
I-Is there a problem?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.870
Damn, isn't this the same as three days ago?

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.940
In other words, isn't it impossible to stop now due to that straightforward personality?

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.570
Good grief, what should I do now?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.610
Somehow or other, I need to let them know what she had just said aren't her true feelings.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.740
...Of course there's a problem. What do you treat others as?

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.210
Kuroneko!?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.440
As what? Didn't I say as disgusting otakus?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.040
Disgusting... right. Then, I wonder if you could explain which part is disgusting?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:08.040
H-Huh~? What are you saying? I'll say it's disgusting if I feel that it is!

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.040
I see. You define everything not pretty in your eyes as disgusting. It really suits the opinion of a brainless middle schooler.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.310
Wh-!?

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:30.240
By that definition, your appearance is disgusting in my opinion. Quickly undress or just get out of my sight?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.110
You... are one to talk! Take off that sultry black dress right now!? It makes me feel hot to the point of death just by looking at you!

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.640
Hmph, the same kind of words just like the first time we met. Not only is your vocabulary lacking, even your thinking method is poor.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.170
[INSERT SYMBOLS HERE]

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.140
Oooh, that's Kuroneko for you. She has been researching on how to find faults with Kirino during this one year.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.240
...However, I don't dislike that part of you.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.010
...Eh...?

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.170
It's stimulating to quarrel with you and nothing beats enjoying seeing you being driven mad.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.110
Wh....Wh...

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.270
Kuroneko...you...

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:28.910
It looks your true nature hasn't changed despite losing your memories... All right, I will acknowledge you.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.370
...It's just as she said. I understood after looking at the both of you arguing.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.710
[TL NOTE - Metamorphosis]
The "you" that isn't acknowledging your otaku side is still you. You've just broken your own shell and changed yourself...

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.640
Kiririn-shi didn't change at all. She's still our friend.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.970
You all...

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.710
Tch... I won't be happy to get acknowledgment from otakus.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.610
Kirino... you, just can't keep your smile in as usual.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.960
However... that's right. Even if she were to forget about her otaku interests, Kirino is still Kirino. My little sister.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.510
Today is the day of Comiket.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.040
After a long period of time since our last gathering, we met up with an unexpectantly situation at the venue.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.410
Yeah, I still feel that it's a good song no matter how many times I listen to it!

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.440
The organizer of this event has very good taste to have chosen my song!

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.270
...No, didn't you say it was disgusting and detestable the other day?

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.740
Hahaha, a maiden's thoughts changes like the sky during autumn. Kyousuke-shi.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.610
*sigh*

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.240
However, it's summer now.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.610
At any rate, to think that this crackling denpa song would be selected, it seems that there's something wrong with this world I live in.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.140
You've been noisy like a person of limited experience and outlook since the start. Know your place, my ears have been hurting ever since coming in here.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.240
Huh? Could you not vent your anger on me just because your circle couldn't participate?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.010
I'm busy making a game this time... so I didn't have the time to create a doujinshi.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.470
These two will never change.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.140
In the end, all my hard struggles were in vain, Kirino's otaku memories didn't return.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:26.040
I was still worrying that her relationship with Kuroneko and Saori will have any changes... but it looks like I've been needlessly worrying.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:36.940
Just like the same as before... isn't possible anymore, however, both of them seem like they want to recover the lost past and quarrel whenever they meet.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.570
But, it'll definitely be all good if it's the both of them.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.540
Eh, when did you walk to my side!? Furthermore, why are your lips so close to my ears!?

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.410
Shh! There's something I've been wanting to hear from you.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.570
...Wanting to hear?

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.870
S-Say...

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.610
W-What is it?

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.640
H-Hey, I hope you're not going to say something like it's disgusting all of a sudden and you wish to go home.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.940
We...haven't done any strange things... before I lost my memories, right?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.310
Not at all---!

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.640
How far are you going to take this misunderstanding?!

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.240
T-That's because... when I asked, both of them said my relationship with you was very close.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.770
That's a misunderstanding on their part. You won't even greet me when we meet, a horrible little sister.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.770
M-Moreover...

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.910
...Some of my underwear have gone missing... could it be you that have stolen them?

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:44.070
No! I couldn't have taken them! Where in this world exists an elder brother that gets excited by stealing his little sister's underwear!?

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.270
You must have taken my underwear to sniff them, am I right?

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.870
That's what you do to your little sister in 2D! Don't mix it up with 3D.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.140
W-What? Onii-pan is a masterpiece!

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:09.770
Recently, Kirino has been playing sister-related games again. It seems that she's been a little afraid, and so she wishes to get back her memories.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:20.210
Although it's praiseworthy to have a proactive attitude towards the matter... she's an even greater dangerous existence with her incomplete knowledge on the otaku community.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.240
It's commonly said that it's more dangerous to give firearms to amateurs than professionals.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.770
Anyway, I don't know where your panties have gone to.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.070
...How did you know... the ones missing are panties?

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.170
Could it be...!?

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:44.270
H-Hold it... I-It was when you were telling Mom about it. Accidentally, I accidentally to have heard it.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.210
Hmph...

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:56.540
Hahaha. The Kousaka siblings are getting along with each other even though her memories aren't returned yet.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.810
Heh... what a hopeless pair of siscon and brocon.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.040
Stop talking and save me!

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.690
You're such a perverted siscon------!!

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.940
In the end, Kirino's memories didn't return.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:35.310
However, we aren't discouraged at all. If you were to ask us why, that's because my little sister holds herself in high regards, a super middle school girl that carries out her own words.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.340
Even in the case that we gave up, her memories are bound to come back to her someday.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.490
Hold it! I'll definitely fix those memories of mine by any means possible!

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.140
