00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.870
 and good guys and welcome applauded 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.119
 I don't know the boys are mothers 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 welcome this new retro flash 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.350
 today the kids want to talk to you about a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.710
 game that my mom dedicates stops you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 I say just sign ok that is just you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 you have to stop no because the game a little 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.279
 little adrenaline so a certain must 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 well stop ok carcela from all that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.030
 which I just said from the darling really 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 sad but the boys of what i am 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.790
 speaking 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 I'm talking about an action stuntman 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.610
 racing game developed by reflection 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 interactive 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.920
 I hope I said it well because mine 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.600
 Pronunciation is really worthwhile and published 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.520
 from the 2002 data for playstation 2 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.719
 gameboy advance has never seen the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.370
 game boy advance version 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 for me it is an urban legend but 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 I'm almost sure there is hope 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.870
 because i hope they didn't say one 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.059
 crap 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 and what this game consists of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.510
 basically we are a stuntman 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.420
 from how we can deduce from the title e 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.159
 we will have to perform several jumps 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.159
 breathtaking on the edge of the human 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.260
 possible imaginable while respecting 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.560
 always the various times is still that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.990
 that imposes us in the game in a sense 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.509
 we should do really hallucinating things 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.320
 like I don't know 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.240
 try to avoid making bombs swerves 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.439
 to the extent possible 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 really because it was something 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.570
 impossible ace game and the thing then more 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.420
 difficult absolute that did not remain type 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 digressing about all the random things of the type 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.670
 that we had to go against traffic and 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.649
 dodge certain machines by type 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.270
 I give a neighbor's bazaar by touching them in 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.369
 infinitesimal manner 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.770
 I do not know if you can say so had 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.929
 just remove the mirror in a 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.460
 some sense it is more we do this instant 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.000
 in view of these agro-bazzi and in a manner 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.009
 precise and in the right time of course it is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.520
 the more we noticed the points and the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:10.299
 stopwatch like any arcade you do 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.150
 respects was reset not there 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.799
 then we were reset 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.569
 we had to look for our purpose was 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.870
 that of trying not to reach 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.549
 at the stopwatch, zero as we did 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.410
 precisely we must do this moment in 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.060
 precise manner 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.330
 okay the rest of the guys really was there 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.370
 of everything we went on the movie set that 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.100
 surely those who are passionate about cinema 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
