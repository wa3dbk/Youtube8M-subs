00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.090 
plans for these guys he wants them to
have<00:00:39.390> randomized<00:00:39.930> textures<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.829> look<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
have randomized textures so they look a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
have randomized textures so they look a
little<00:00:41.219> different<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.760> unique<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.570> each

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
little different and unique with each

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.529 
little different and unique with each
mob<00:00:43.079> he'd<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.160> dropped<00:00:44.460> horns<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
mob he'd like if they dropped horns so

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
mob he'd like if they dropped horns so
you<00:00:45.600> could<00:00:45.840> brew<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.200> potions<00:00:46.680> using<00:00:47.039> their

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
you could brew some potions using their

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
you could brew some potions using their
little<00:00:47.430> horns<00:00:47.700> either<00:00:48.300> strength<00:00:48.780> potions<00:00:49.289> or

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little horns either strength potions or

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
little horns either strength potions or
resistance<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.940> no<00:00:51.120> way

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
resistance now right now we have no way

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.850 
resistance now right now we have no way
of<00:00:51.300> getting<00:00:51.420> resistance<00:00:51.960> potions<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.649> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
of getting resistance potions so this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.350 
of getting resistance potions so this
mod<00:00:53.070> would<00:00:53.250> actually<00:00:53.489> add<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> lot<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> game

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
mod would actually add a lot to the game

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
mod would actually add a lot to the game
it<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.469> kind<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> rare<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it would have to be just kind of rare to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
it would have to be just kind of rare to
make<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:56.910> since<00:00:57.149> resistance<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
make them since resistance is so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.569 
make them since resistance is so
powerful<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> goes<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> sturdy

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
powerful but it goes with the sturdy

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.090 
powerful but it goes with the sturdy
nature<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.539> bison<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> strength<00:01:01.739> potion

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
nature of the bison that strength potion

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.410 
nature of the bison that strength potion
would<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> cool<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.059> because

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
would be kind of cool as well because

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.640 
would be kind of cool as well because
right<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> nether

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
right now you have to go into the nether

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
right now you have to go into the nether
to<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.339> blaze<00:01:05.580> powder<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to get blaze powder if you want one of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
to get blaze powder if you want one of
those<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.320> peaceful

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
those but if you want a more peaceful

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.440 
those but if you want a more peaceful
life<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.250> probably<00:01:08.400> raise<00:01:08.790> these

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
life you could probably raise these

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
life you could probably raise these
bison<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> future<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> mods<00:01:10.890> more

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
bison in the future when the mods more

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.370 
bison in the future when the mods more
developed<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.850> few<00:01:12.330> other<00:01:12.510> things<00:01:12.780> he<00:01:13.170> wants

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
developed a few other things he wants

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
developed a few other things he wants
them<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.860> unique<00:01:14.580> sounds<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.390> well<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
them to have unique sounds as well so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.179 
them to have unique sounds as well so
right<00:01:16.229> now<00:01:16.350> they're<00:01:16.590> very<00:01:16.619> similar<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
right now they're very similar to the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.740 
right now they're very similar to the
cows<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.670> mentioned<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.119> make<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
cows like I mentioned they make the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
cows like I mentioned they make the
little<00:01:18.900> moves<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.680> stomps<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.159> stuff<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
little moves and stomps and stuff the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
little moves and stomps and stuff the
very<00:01:20.909> heavy<00:01:21.210> stomp<00:01:21.659> sound<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> cow<00:01:22.560> has

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
very heavy stomp sound that the cow has

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
very heavy stomp sound that the cow has
works<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.310> well<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.970> bison<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.869> yeah

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
works really well for the bison so yeah

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
works really well for the bison so yeah
I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> future<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.400> guys<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:27.030> get

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
I think in the future these guys can get

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.460 
I think in the future these guys can get
