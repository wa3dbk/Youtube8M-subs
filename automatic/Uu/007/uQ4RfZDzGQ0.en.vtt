00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
so one of the chief areas this car

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.330 
so one of the chief areas this car
really<00:04:04.780> sort<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.290> let<00:04:05.409> me<00:04:05.560> down<00:04:05.739> was<00:04:06.099> in<00:04:06.250> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
really sort of let me down was in the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.520 
really sort of let me down was in the
drivetrain<00:04:06.790> refinement<00:04:07.599> department<00:04:08.200> this

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.679 
drivetrain refinement department this
manual<00:04:08.950> transmission<00:04:09.640> really<00:04:10.120> makes<00:04:10.359> a<00:04:10.510> lot

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
manual transmission really makes a lot

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:11.910 
manual transmission really makes a lot
of<00:04:10.719> noise<00:04:10.989> when<00:04:11.260> you're<00:04:11.439> running<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.890> through

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
of noise when you're running it through

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.979 
of noise when you're running it through
the<00:04:12.129> gears<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.879> I<00:04:13.329> was<00:04:13.480> even<00:04:13.719> getting<00:04:13.959> some

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
the gears and I was even getting some

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.439 
the gears and I was even getting some
driveline<00:04:14.680> noise<00:04:14.980> from<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.459> rear<00:04:15.670> axle<00:04:16.239> which

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.539 
driveline noise from the rear axle which
really<00:04:17.079> felt<00:04:17.410> how<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.590> place<00:04:17.859> in<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.130> car<00:04:18.340> that

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
really felt how to place in a car that

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.100 
really felt how to place in a car that
cost<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:19.030> much<00:04:21.539> despite<00:04:22.539> it's<00:04:22.720> lesson
