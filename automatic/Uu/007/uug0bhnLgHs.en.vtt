00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the idea okay let's try this the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.970 
the idea okay let's try this the
technique<00:00:30.990> I've<00:00:31.140> mentioned<00:00:31.470> before<00:00:31.500> with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
technique I've mentioned before with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.139 
technique I've mentioned before with
ginger<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> peel<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
ginger is that you can peel it with a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.040 
ginger is that you can peel it with a
spoon<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:34.320> we'll<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:35.130> slices

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
spoon now we'll just do some slices

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
spoon now we'll just do some slices
let's<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:38.129> simple

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
let's just do about that much simple

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110 
let's just do about that much simple
syrup<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> equal<00:00:40.170> parts<00:00:40.500> water<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> sugar<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
syrup is equal parts water and sugar so

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
syrup is equal parts water and sugar so
I<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.300> 1<00:00:42.480> cup<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> water<00:00:43.070> one<00:00:44.070> cup<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.340> white

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I have 1 cup of water one cup of white

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
I have 1 cup of water one cup of white
sugar<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.239> put<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.660> over<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.960> medium<00:00:46.289> heat

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
sugar and put that over a medium heat

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000 
sugar and put that over a medium heat
until<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.329> starts<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> simmer<00:00:48.899> stir<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> around

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
until it starts to simmer stir it around

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.170 
until it starts to simmer stir it around
so<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> sugar<00:00:50.850> dissolves<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.890> actually

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
so the sugar dissolves and actually

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
so the sugar dissolves and actually
we're<00:00:54.180> gonna<00:00:54.270> add<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> ginger<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.440> into

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
we're gonna add the ginger right into

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.670 
we're gonna add the ginger right into
this<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.329> lemon<00:00:58.050> zest

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

this a little bit of lemon zest
we<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.820> simmering<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.410> I'll<00:01:01.530> turn<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.829> heat

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we have simmering so I'll turn this heat

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.630 
we have simmering so I'll turn this heat
off<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.250> pour<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> through<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.840> strainer<00:01:04.640> and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
off now pour it through a strainer and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.950 
off now pour it through a strainer and
that<00:01:05.820> gets<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> ginger<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> lemon

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

that gets out the ginger and the lemon
zest<00:01:07.229> slice<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> cucumber<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.850> thinly

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.709 

strain<00:01:19.840> out<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.020> memory<00:01:21.329> we<00:01:22.329> have<00:01:22.450> five

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
strain out the memory we have five

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.719 
strain out the memory we have five
lemons<00:01:22.990> including<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.039> one<00:01:24.219> that<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.729> zested

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
lemons including the one that I zested

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.010 
lemons including the one that I zested
one<00:01:27.729> thing<00:01:27.939> that's<00:01:28.119> interesting<00:01:28.359> about<00:01:28.719> this

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
one thing that's interesting about this

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.859 
one thing that's interesting about this
kind<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.499> a<00:01:29.590> juicer<00:01:30.009> I<00:01:30.249> learned<00:01:30.490> recently<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
kind of a juicer I learned recently you

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.419 
kind of a juicer I learned recently you
would<00:01:32.020> think<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.649> would<00:01:32.770> line<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.100> up<00:01:33.189> so

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
would think that you would line it up so

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.730 
would think that you would line it up so
this<00:01:33.609> goes<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.240> juicy<00:01:35.109> part<00:01:35.349> but<00:01:35.590> you

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
this goes on the juicy part but you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.480 
this goes on the juicy part but you
actually<00:01:35.920> put<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.459> upside<00:01:36.759> down<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.369> if

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
actually put it in upside down and if

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.569 
actually put it in upside down and if
you<00:01:45.640> accidentally<00:01:46.149> get<00:01:46.329> seeds<00:01:46.719> in<00:01:46.959> there

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you accidentally get seeds in there

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.089 
you accidentally get seeds in there
scoop<00:01:48.579> those<00:01:48.789> out<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.299> top<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.679> seeds<00:01:50.920> are

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
scoop those out to top but the seeds are

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.319 
scoop those out to top but the seeds are
smaller<00:01:51.909> than<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.239> holes<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.569> this<00:01:52.659> thing

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
smaller than the holes in this thing

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.940 
smaller than the holes in this thing
okay<00:01:55.329> add<00:01:56.009> three<00:01:57.009> cups<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.640> water<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.530> one<00:01:59.920> cup
