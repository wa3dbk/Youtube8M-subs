00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
at the same time in order to drop it
which<00:01:59.189> could<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> hard<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.540> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
which could be hard because they really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
which could be hard because they really
don't<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.200> any<00:02:01.409> real<00:02:01.619> way<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.979> dropping<00:02:02.159> but
