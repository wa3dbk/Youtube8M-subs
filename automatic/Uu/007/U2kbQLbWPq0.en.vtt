 Pond length the Danes Steel has seen that 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.850
 The victory has helped actively helped that the Thuner wins 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.130
 it was my play in pieces of recklies hoping they would 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.090
 because with percentages done by those skipping the chances in the in the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.730
 Offensive did not win today bunting 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.730

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.980
 even easier on the numbers the game time also Horst percent 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.230
 Passport security and accuracy fits as significant 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.650
 around 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.040
 Made mistakes 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 Nonetheless, we also have our chances around 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.020
 the team also tried to play forward not that the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.740
 the tuner cases she smoke Michael Melka 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.880

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.939
 before a taboo in the second half a shot of format Petzner 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.400
 yes, but today we ascribe 1 percent to ourselves as so often in the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.530
 the last few weeks that we were around 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.790
 yes for sensations care services 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.610
 Do not reward that we just make too many mistakes whether it is in the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.190
 Offensive today on the defensive and percent 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.200
 therefore 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.780
 yes, these data are working hard this week and percent 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.490
 Days have already been talked about whether today I awaits with defiance reaction Cheval 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490

 the way loses 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.070
 and Angie 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.730
 David Hoh's MÃ¼hldorfer Stadtsaal ask or ask questions 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 Coach Brunswick 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 that is not the case then please pass the word to Ortmeier very much 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.079
 we started very well differently 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 scored early 1 0 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.339
 Hangzhou currently at me really had to handle the game under control 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.569
 a low-lying opponent then but 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.349
 completely unnecessary 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.359
 have worked too much with long balls in the game setup my colleague said 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.459
 Greipel 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 many bad passes but we have trade build up 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.819
 many mistakes made unnecessary mistakes before and thus one I the opponent 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.499
 invited to counter even though we led 1 0 then that must not happen 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.149
 there we have a higher just as necessary self-confidence and also 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.599
 then show the necessary peace 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.999
 and I think we have to force the second one right now 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.669
 Industry has emerged a bit LKH two days today responded excellently 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.599
 the 1 1 was a beautiful final score from the fox that was for me 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
 consistent Aldi because we have done too little in the phase 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.659
 but also there you can go back to the Cook Trio video 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.129
 I have already seen in the game because we did not bother again 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.150
 Opponents are not pressured and so he can free through the midfield against 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.859
 wonderfully hit the ball Kottmann already in the beginning see that there what 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.249
 dangerous come out 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.509
 Hamdan al Azhar pointed out that Percent Rossi be it is nothing 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.449
 there is still 45 minutes left 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.549
 we will continue our possibilities and applies the 2 1 and 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.010
 natural glorious pass from Monika Eisenberg will be awesome then taxe 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.919
 for dar 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.969
 Adessa from such things then cool and clever 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.339
 b scored a goal he did and after the 2 1 it was after conventional 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.049
 pure fighting game 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.469
 Percent both teams have sacrificially engaged in every duel 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.549
 that's also important every one of that that's every one of my crew 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:58.759
 Of course we wanted people to do it. Wife is the Abarth 500 man 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.769
 says so beautifully 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.879
 Did she live the whole week flu, you want to see the climate 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.540
 the EHC has certainly stood up properly also served the budget 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.049
 on the gums 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.600
 incidentally the young thieves then came in next to 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.710
 We are always hopeful approaches to see but they need 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.419
 even today 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.039
 Life and therefore we are equipped with a small squad 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.539
 and now we have to see that we continue to score and of course we want to 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.830
 further points that is very clear 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.030
 where we stand that is a snapshot we are happy 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.999
 about that 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.240
 I think one or the other is going to let the teletext on today too 

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:39.389
 You should also take the picture with you and you should also be happy about it 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.139
 is so week it is already forgotten or even from tomorrow 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.300
 forget again 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.300
 can not and should not overtake tomorrow Aldi because they do not play 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.799
