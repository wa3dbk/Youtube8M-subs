YouTube<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.079> reviews<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
YouTube actually have some reviews and I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.979 
YouTube actually have some reviews and I
came<00:00:59.820> across<00:01:00.030> Kareena<00:01:00.510> hair<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:02.280> few

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
came across Kareena hair and a few

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.140 
came across Kareena hair and a few
youtubers<00:01:03.989> had<00:01:04.320> done<00:01:04.619> reviews<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:05.939> but

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
youtubers had done reviews on them but

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
youtubers had done reviews on them but
it<00:01:06.270> wasn't<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.630> massive<00:01:07.170> beauty<00:01:07.590> gurus<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it wasn't like massive beauty gurus so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
it wasn't like massive beauty gurus so
obviously<00:01:09.060> they're<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.360> sit<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.750> sent<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
obviously they're gonna sit get sent the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.950 
obviously they're gonna sit get sent the
best<00:01:10.560> hair<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.490> whatever<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.570> normal<00:01:12.930> people

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
best hair and whatever as normal people

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.039 
best hair and whatever as normal people
will<00:01:13.650> receive<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.299> probably<00:01:15.540> be

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
will receive it will probably be

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.609 
will receive it will probably be
but<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> thought<00:01:17.100> maybe<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.790> trust<00:01:18.000> them

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619
