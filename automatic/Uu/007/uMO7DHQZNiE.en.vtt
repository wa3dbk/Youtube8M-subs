00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.129
 well now let's learn how to do 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.699
 humintas the first step is to shed the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:21.570
 I did it with a knife and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.830
 Shelling after I have off 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.830
 this mole dor 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.200
 and this is the result when they are more 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.770
 fresh has a consistency more than 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.000
 Butter and I 'm already melted 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:46.040
 melt in the do not let it boil alone 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 melt and how my corn is very dry 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:55.399
 I'm going to increase milk well let's 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 start putting all the butter and go 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.170
 stirring 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.870
 little by little 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 well the next step is to put 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.990
 half spoon of sugar is a 2 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.610
 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.250
 and we're going to make him leave because he's 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.549
 singing someone and we're going for this is 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.950
 like less than half a cup of milk but 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.159
 let's go as if testing 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.730
 we know what consistency is going to have this 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.640
 throwing milk 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.800
 where was the salt and sugar my 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 assistant washed his hands very well 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.600
 before doing all this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 Mix very well everything 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.510
 and 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.960
 and here 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.230
 this time fourth cup of milk and what 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.420
 We put in the microwave and again 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.400
 Then you can see the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.400
 mommy consistency can you show them 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.960
 It is also increasing me a little bit 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.050
 come out because to us a little bit and a 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.789
 little more milk here is depends on the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.950
 corn that you are using if you are 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.690
 cool then they will not need 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.570
 take almost no milk 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.570
 that thickness and then split in half 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.690
 then always put enough cheese 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 although if not without that it does not have 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.800
 jokes the next thing to do is put together 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.819
 a little margarine 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.680
 to the mold so that it does not stick 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.340
 you have to spread very well until you 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.550
 sides 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.599
 It occurred to him to reveal to us his secret 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.660
 kitchen and the mix we made is 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:00.110
 scraping some cheese so you have 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.230
 more flavor we are not scraped off the cheese 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.390
 we mixed and my mom before putting 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.510
 I was again very dry then 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.849
 I add a little vegetable oil and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.930
 a little bit of milk and now he's going to 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.930
 to the mold 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 once they have it well spread they go 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.970
 to start putting the cheese 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.270
 let's put it like that and this is steal 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.540
 and that depends on how much 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:39.280
 want cheese 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.709
 once having put all in shape 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.400
 vertical is crushing them is 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.299
 getting in 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.840
 and have been hot at 180 degrees 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.700
 we are going to put it and we are going to leave it 40 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.700
 45 minutes 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.200
 and well finally that is how it is 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.440
 our oven took about an hour and 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.420
 average because the fire is very very slow 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.590
 but in their ovens it should take 45 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.730
 minutes or maximum one hour first caught 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.940
 everything very well and we put a stick for 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.400
 see if it came out dry then it was already 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.160
 everything well cooked and then we upload it 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:38.090
 up the live ones and we put the grill for 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.710
 that they brown very well like that and that's how 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.710
 ends our increase 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.360
 and yes
