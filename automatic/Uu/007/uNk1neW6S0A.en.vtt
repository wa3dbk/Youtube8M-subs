as well so let's for example let's take

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.789 
as well so let's for example let's take
a<00:00:48.729> look<00:00:48.879> at<00:00:49.000> Death<00:00:49.119> Note<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.559> UI<00:00:50.799> is<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.790> bit<00:00:52.799> on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
a look at Death Note the UI is a bit on

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.520 
a look at Death Note the UI is a bit on
the<00:00:53.949> jarring<00:00:54.309> side<00:00:54.580> I<00:00:54.820> am<00:00:55.180> NOT<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.720> big<00:00:56.199> fan<00:00:56.229> of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
the jarring side I am NOT a big fan of

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.820 
the jarring side I am NOT a big fan of
the<00:00:56.860> background<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:58.540> colors<00:00:59.500> for<00:00:59.710> the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
the background and the colors for the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.429 
the background and the colors for the
fonts<00:01:00.189> used<00:01:00.460> but<00:01:01.449> then<00:01:01.659> that<00:01:01.869> is<00:01:02.019> kind<00:01:02.320> of

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.439 
fonts used but then that is kind of

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.200 
fonts used but then that is kind of
immaterial<00:01:03.040> because<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.699> just<00:01:03.879> want<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.150> be

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
immaterial because we just want to be

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.719 
immaterial because we just want to be
watching<00:01:04.540> an<00:01:05.049> episode<00:01:05.590> but<00:01:06.159> her<00:01:06.310> like<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.200 

now<00:02:05.950> as<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.130> can<00:02:06.220> see<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.549> picture<00:02:07.119> quality

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
now as you can see the picture quality

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.479 
now as you can see the picture quality
is<00:02:07.450> quite<00:02:07.840> decent<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.440> definitely<00:02:08.890> not<00:02:09.039> HD

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
is quite decent it's definitely not HD

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.839 
is quite decent it's definitely not HD
but<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.330> definitely<00:02:10.569> watchable<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> I'll

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
but it's definitely watchable so I'll

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.809 
but it's definitely watchable so I'll
say<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.540> random<00:02:13.840> fan<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.739> app<00:02:14.890> would<00:02:15.190> rank

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
say for a random fan the app would rank

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.699 
say for a random fan the app would rank
pretty<00:02:16.150> high<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> would<00:02:16.780> give<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.230> 4<00:02:17.440> out<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.590> 5

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
pretty high I would give it a 4 out of 5

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.990 
pretty high I would give it a 4 out of 5
the<00:02:18.670> developer<00:02:19.209> could<00:02:19.330> definitely<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:20.050> with

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the developer could definitely do with

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.600 
the developer could definitely do with
working<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.120> bit<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.569> UI<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:24.220> other<00:02:24.430> than

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.509 
working a bit on the UI but other than
that<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.880> app<00:02:25.030> works<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.630> very<00:02:25.900> functional

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
that the app works it's very functional

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.630 
that the app works it's very functional
so<00:02:27.519> yeah<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:28.870> online<00:02:29.200> app<00:02:29.380> by<00:02:29.590> by<00:02:29.800> soft<00:02:30.160> gets<00:02:30.550> a
