00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 we in the project the fundamental thing 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 is to develop diagnostic methods and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.690
 of early treatment of children with 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.630
 risk factors for brain damage is 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.510
 for this we have used a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.660
 multidisciplinary procedure in 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.920
 where children are evaluated from 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.350
 very different views you see no 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.820
 only his conduct and his development 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.630
 psychomotor but also they are made 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 electroencephalography to see how 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.340
 works the brain is done 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.739
 auditory evoked potentials for 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.350
 detect if you have hearing problems or 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 no potential problems evoked 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 visuals also to detect if you have 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 visual problems or not and they are also 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.589
 makes an analysis of the structure 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 brain through a resonance 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.600
 magnetic this magnetic resonance we 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.790
 gives details about all 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.360
 features of the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.230
 and it allows us to see if there is any type 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.950
 of injury or not in our case we have 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.290
 seen that of the children that reach us 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.480
 80% of children have alterations in 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.510
 the magnetic resonance so that 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.450
 We are working with children who have 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.790
 really a high probability of having 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 a sequel 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.250
 to avoid these sequels then what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 first thing we did was try to avoid 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.450
 the motor sequels because then these 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.750
 are the most disabling for a child 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.610
 then this we followed a method that was 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.910
 described by a Hungarian called 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.520
 katona and the method is called neuro 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.890
 habilitation is called neuro 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.610
 habilitation and not rehabilitation 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.330
 because it has not yet manifested and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.010
 the signs of the injury then 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.570
 we take advantage of the earlier time 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.610
 immediately after birth when 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.720
 there is greater plasticity of the system 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.410
 nervous to start this treatment 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.440
 the treatment is highly intensive and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.670
 a specific program is made for each 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.600
 child according to the signs that 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.920
 present and how old he is and 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.710
 They give a series of exercises to perform 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.370
 that parents are taught how 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.730
 do it then are sessions 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.710
 approximately 45 minutes and they should 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.440
 perform these four sessions to 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.330
 five times a day therefore as you see 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.330
 It is very very intensive
