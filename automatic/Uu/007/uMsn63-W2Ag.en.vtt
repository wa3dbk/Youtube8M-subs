00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.530 
a project trophy truck tube chassis it's
gonna<00:00:07.549> be<00:00:07.669> made<00:00:07.850> out<00:00:07.970> of<00:00:08.029> the<00:00:08.149> stainless<00:00:08.389> steel

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
gonna be made out of the stainless steel

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.379 
gonna be made out of the stainless steel
rods<00:00:10.660> anyway<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:11.719> you<00:00:12.080> bought<00:00:12.349> the<00:00:13.389> team

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
rods anyway so you bought the team

flux core self shielding wire it just

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.679 
flux core self shielding wire it just
works<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:25.070> lot<00:00:25.250> easier<00:00:25.640> than<00:00:25.789> doing<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.510> gas

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
works a lot easier than doing the gas

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.800 
works a lot easier than doing the gas
with<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.080> stainless<00:00:27.320> steel<00:00:28.539> some<00:00:29.539> round

sharpen the chain bolt cutters tubing
bender<00:00:41.200> so<00:00:42.200> I'm<00:00:42.260> going<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.470> use<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.830> turn<00:00:43.040> to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
bender so I'm going to use to turn to

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.600 
bender so I'm going to use to turn to
bend<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.680> rod<00:00:45.940> some<00:00:46.940> vice<00:00:47.150> grips<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:48.860> hold

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
bend the rod some vice grips to hold

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.570 
bend the rod some vice grips to hold
dead<00:00:50.090> pieces<00:00:50.540> together<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.860> some<00:00:52.100> alligator

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
dead pieces together and some alligator

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.330 
dead pieces together and some alligator
clips<00:00:54.220> this<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.460> piece<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:56.720> just<00:00:57.320> bent<00:00:57.860> as<00:00:58.100> a

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
clips this is a piece I just bent as a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.770 
clips this is a piece I just bent as a
stainless<00:00:58.790> steel<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:01.760> works<00:01:01.940> okay<00:01:02.300> but<00:01:02.660> it's

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
stainless steel it works okay but it's

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.130 
stainless steel it works okay but it's
works<00:01:03.020> pretty<00:01:03.200> smooth<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.449> reason<00:01:05.810> why<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:05.990> got

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
works pretty smooth the reason why I got

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.100 
works pretty smooth the reason why I got
the<00:01:06.260> bolt<00:01:06.500> cutters<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:07.490> because<00:01:07.910> it<00:01:08.030> does<00:01:08.240> this

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
the bolt cutters is because it does this

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.840 
the bolt cutters is because it does this
little<00:01:09.170> notch<00:01:09.710> on<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:11.090> edge<00:01:12.190> when<00:01:13.190> you<00:01:13.280> cut<00:01:13.550> it

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
little notch on the edge when you cut it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.790 
little notch on the edge when you cut it
and<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.540> when<00:01:14.840> I'm<00:01:14.960> gonna<00:01:15.110> weld<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.590> I'm<00:01:15.680> gonna

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
and so when I'm gonna weld it I'm gonna

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.530 
and so when I'm gonna weld it I'm gonna
weld<00:01:16.070> either<00:01:16.310> side<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.820> notch<00:01:17.210> up

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
weld either side of that notch up

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.350 
weld either side of that notch up
against<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.990> bar<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:19.820> will<00:01:20.030> have

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
against the bar so this will have

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.400 
against the bar so this will have
something<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:23.000> wall<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.420> whereas<00:01:24.140> if<00:01:24.260> I

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
something to the wall to whereas if I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.970 
something to the wall to whereas if I
cope<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.950> or<00:01:25.100> not<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.690> know<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:27.320> round<00:01:27.710> hole

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
cope it or not it you know a round hole

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.970 
cope it or not it you know a round hole
so<00:01:28.820> fits<00:01:29.120> over<00:01:29.480> smooth<00:01:29.810> then<00:01:30.680> I'm<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:30.950> to

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
so fits over smooth then I'm going to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.090 
so fits over smooth then I'm going to
have<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.430> big<00:01:31.760> bulge<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:33.610> weld<00:01:34.610> slag<00:01:35.830> going<00:01:36.830> over

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
have a big bulge of weld slag going over

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.730 
have a big bulge of weld slag going over
it<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.790> that's<00:01:38.030> why<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.240> went<00:01:38.630> with<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.140> bolt

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
it so that's why I went with the bolt

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.200 
it so that's why I went with the bolt
cutters<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:42.350> I<00:01:42.380> have<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:43.520> little<00:01:43.940> groove

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
cutters so I have that little groove

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.719 
cutters so I have that little groove
right<00:01:44.420> there<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:44.930> V<00:01:45.140> notch<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.310> can<00:01:46.520> weld

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
right there that V notch so I can weld

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.980 
right there that V notch so I can weld
on<00:01:46.940> either<00:01:47.150> side<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.460> bar

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
on either side of it to that to the bar

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.430 
on either side of it to that to the bar
so<00:01:50.990> anyways<00:01:51.790> some<00:01:52.790> tools<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:53.600> got<00:01:53.780> just

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
so anyways some tools I just got just

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.190 
so anyways some tools I just got just
went<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.680> Harbor<00:01:55.010> Freight<00:01:55.540> anyways

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
went to Harbor Freight anyways

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.770 
went to Harbor Freight anyways
stay<00:01:57.710> tuned<00:01:57.979> for<00:01:58.870> some<00:01:59.870> more<00:02:00.850> stuff<00:02:01.850> I'm<00:02:02.659> gonna

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
stay tuned for some more stuff I'm gonna

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.930 
stay tuned for some more stuff I'm gonna
be<00:02:02.900> doing<00:02:03.260> step-by-step<00:02:03.979> stuff<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.580> might<00:02:04.729> not

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
be doing step-by-step stuff I might not

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.760 
be doing step-by-step stuff I might not
show<00:02:05.920> me<00:02:06.920> actually<00:02:07.159> welding<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.820> stuff

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
show me actually welding the stuff

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.500 
show me actually welding the stuff
probably<00:02:09.770> just<00:02:10.069> do<00:02:10.670> some<00:02:10.910> stuff<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.420> then

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
probably just do some stuff and then

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.990 
probably just do some stuff and then
video<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.250> do<00:02:13.250> some<00:02:13.490> more<00:02:13.640> stuff

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
video it do some more stuff

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.380 
video it do some more stuff
video<00:02:14.240> again<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.650> anyways<00:02:16.070> stay<00:02:16.970> tuned<00:02:17.180> for

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
video again so anyways stay tuned for

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.810 
video again so anyways stay tuned for
more<00:02:17.540> stuff
