00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.699
 yes friends what is going on warmly 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 Welcome here to our new video 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.140
 This time it's something different like 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.130
 Although the to a comparison between the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.429
 16 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.669
 and in the zoo experience i got myself 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.859
 long time for a new mobile phone 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.449
 looked around and yes wanted to go now 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.170
 that you might contribute faster 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.680
 finds a new phone and yes we have 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
 I think two and very smart phones 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.650
 I'll give you a quick look 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.580
 general data say that and that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.940
 apple iphone 6 weighs 129 grams 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.550
 Sony 152 is not the program as a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.240
 not much fat but not much about me 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.340
 believe 14 millimeters that is already 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.900
 but realized that is the sony can I 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
 bad that it leads so better 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.640
 and yes the display is a little bigger 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 at the sony you can see each other 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 directly I can not do it so well 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.550
 the camera is not great but it does not matter 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.250
 and yes because that's the pixeldichte 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.130
 also much higher here 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.620
 We have 400 224 ppi and at the beginning 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.510
 Of course we have 326 ppi 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.930
 difference makes but I have to 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.570
 say 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 It is not so much so on 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.340
 is not a huge difference now 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.220
 and therefore here is of course android 4 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.650
 point 4.4 kit kat and here is everything 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.330
 eight of course, the cameras are on it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 clearly different from the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.300
 megapixel as just six has eight 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.140
 megapixel on the intron camera and on 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.920
 the front has 12 megapixels and the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.640
 sony has 20 megapixels and here 2 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 megapixel 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.480
 the video quality is full on iphone 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.640
 hd of course and the sony even 4 k what 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.270
 But so I personally use it 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.700
 not as much 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.070
 The battery is much larger here but 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.870
 I have to say many, quite honestly 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.020
 let's say that sony does that much 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.870
 better battery I can not find now 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.850
 so strong but good is relatively fast 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.670
 I have all this morning I am 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.110
 now since may are two hours of brook 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.750
 he also sees in her time and yes so 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.430
 we have sunday and yes both 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.290
 Of course, that can be quite clear 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.940
 I also use on the Sony's works 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.680
 really good speed 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.420
 really fast is really good and yes 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.040
 Here the advantage when sony is the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.350
 waterproof it is you surely know 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.500
 is really really good that holds 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.660
 also from the iphone course has to 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.010
 fingerprint sensor that does not have that 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.230
 but there is a really cool 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.180
 feature has to be said that twice 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.250
 aperture is really fast here 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.930
 you , I can do it again 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.010
 also works really great you have to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.300
 before but still in the settings 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.730
 but do not activate this problem 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.519
 then we come to a direct comparison 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:11.330
 and that we will be hard katy perry 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:14.420
 heard direct comparison of course 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.680
 all the ios android stuff now play 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.450
 stalking app store you can 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.820
 do not have to look elsewhere now 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.870
 do and yes what I wanted to do who 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.519
 once with it was 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.739
 I 'm really slow in here 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.500
 internet but now you can see 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.100
 with whom arrives faster with the c3 or 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.330
 at a simple 6 we have to be on it 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.560
 I pay attention to the tabs 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.560
 should be nothing 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.740
 now the tabs are closed and 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:03.080
 then we'll do the comparison 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:03.080
 There is also a check in your server 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:15.410
 Berlin 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:15.410
 and yes then take the last test 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.290
 and you already see the solis a little bit 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.480
 more quickly 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.600
 but if that matters now 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.020
 can you see that sony clearly 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.520
 something really very good and that 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.700
 i also notice the downloads kid 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.450
 much faster and yes also upload 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.740
 would have to card is it was very low what 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.740
 should go up the height again 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.640
 then it was now on the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.640
 Result 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.600
 this is clearer in all cases 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.740
 difference you can live yourself yes so 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.480
 what are we still going to do? 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.450
 Now again, I'll tell you again 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.280
 in short, all features that the Sony has the 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.200
 is really good 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.390
 It has both face recognition 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.960
 of course it has the double cab feature 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.000
 here are good apps on it like trackid 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.260
 appletv there you can find out what you are 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.360
 as soon as one is not true and what is true 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.310
 However, it bothers me again 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.870
 look at all the people 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.490
 Most web store I do not 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.500
 I uninstalled it can you also 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.150
 show again yes I can not do anything 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.720
 good fits or good the three no 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.810
 Installed 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.100
 Well, no matter here, good downloads as always 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.270
 not yet installed but that easy 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.360
 I really need all that shit 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.930
 not good here in may labs this 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.150
 border 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.110
 and yes, that's luck with the iphone 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.130
 not so now My conclusion therefore I 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.680
 that must be each of you yourself 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.070
 decide what to accuse 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.140
 and I do have to say I like the 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.669
 sony it makes a tick better 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.020
 really what would the display is because 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.930
 I notice better but it looks good 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.240
 cool off and the speed is 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.430
 higher than google really nothing 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.919
 i may have a printer or one 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.290
 but even that is kind of shit 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.760
 finished fucking mobile phone so therefore 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.260
 before that i did not have the iphone 6 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.260
 little worry that because I'm not with 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.720
 so the camera we can now 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.900
 times should actually compare the 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.060
 the sony much more I see new 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.910
 but not always so good now 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.470
 Unfortunately you can not know here anymore 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.090
 but still I have to be honest 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.810
 say the son is not now 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.790
 especially 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.050
 So it's good, but above all 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.820
 At night, it's just shit 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.920
 they do not have that well 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.860
 have gotten the better for lg 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.410
 hammer out with the magic 3 but oh well 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.080
 and I live this bad blog 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.020
 are also comparable with heart 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.230
 both school labs and if you ask 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.610
 you write it in the comments give 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.410
 really consider what they themselves 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.040
 want to have it but it is not 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.880
 quite fair 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.470
 so that's about what it costs 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.200
 suggested retail price was included 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.970
 both about the same but that android 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.990
 goes down much faster it lies 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.340
 now at 500 I think so the 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.570
 processor speed are here 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.890
 just much higher you have the three 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.880
 gigabytes have what i have here at all 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.800
 Do not you have trading 801's because 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.240
 I currently so currently but 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.540
 is not the highest but now 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.950
 already really good and the memory knows 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.950
 Yeah sure you could me here too 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.620
 still expanding by 120gb normal are 16 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.990
 I now have to expand by 32 gigabytes 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.760
 This is not a problem 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.230
 and yes, that works really well 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.200
 Settings are clear 

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.690
 you design and you have everything here 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.260
 decide for yourself as you said 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:01.490
 it 's pretty much the same 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.490
 Thanks for watching that 's it
