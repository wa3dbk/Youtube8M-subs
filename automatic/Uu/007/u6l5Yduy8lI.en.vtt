00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.080
 I'm going to give a line on the clothes 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.490
 miami 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.360
 one pound of miami one and a half onion 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.840
 chopped chives which is optional and salt 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.990
 I like a son and a string of olive oil 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.860
 optional 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.989
 This is how we are going to cook miami until 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.550
 he looks good but sly 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.280
 This is just because I said that people 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.489
 You can exchange the miami forman by Jackfruit 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.010
 be cut is a soup you can 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 repeat this same same 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.799
 procedure for all 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.120
 This is how we 're going to cook. 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:56.760
 they already cooked with the onion and I go 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.339
 beat the blender with the sock 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 onion is reserved only to give 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.489
 I do not cook the zucchini flavor but she only 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 heats okay she will not cook will 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.270
 stay with a little taste of the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.070
 raw onion and I'll put the chives 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.810
 to give a little squeeze it's just a thread of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.870
 olive oil and the cars 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.570
 This soup here is not her goal. 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.290
 I know if you have already done this test with 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.750
 As for your dinner , you already made a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 test here whoever has been here has already taken 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.980
 soup one night soup right it is super 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 ze 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.770
 We even go because it's the soup. 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 It's taken very early, so we 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.390
 because it has a very fast direction 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.940
 then the soup of mandioquinha or 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.890
 Caral diÃ¡me, we do it to be of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.490
 jersey as well as make you sleep 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.220
 well at night and yami he has this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.010
 characteristic coining after six 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.120
 research on this all women 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.410
 should eat more 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.330
 miami because of uterine diseases 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.140
 and so on to balance 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.510
 hormones including sleep hormone 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.850
 then miami is one of the things we 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.000
 recommend for people who have insomnia 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.620
 he besides being good of gesture he has 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.990
 this characteristic of balancing 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.770
 harmonics including sleep hormone 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.450
 good 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.450
 We are going to hit the blender. 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.590
 She looks very creamy. 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.430
 And I think we can even put it all together. 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.430
 on here 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.300
 be careful because if you were here 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 warm can lose the time you hit 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.050
 huh 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:24.610
 we will set the targets that we do not 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:26.950
 was achieved with precise salt not 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.800
 needs an edit right 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.810
 I will put it just so someone asked 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.590
 with salve we use some years the salt 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.780
 marine 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.150
 Okay, I'm going to put a little bit of olive oil 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 olive 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:56.380
 It's 2 yarn for the half onion that in this 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.780
 if I just want you guys to give me a 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.330
 Look, it 's just a little bit, it's just for him. 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.700
 give a little more flavor because 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.410
 it has already been included with the onion is 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.410
 so it's not much 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:41.219
 I like well native goes from the taste of 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.219
 you're 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:50.009
 I'll put a little of aus 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.009
 chives now 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:06.340
 and I 'm good, can you warm up? 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.340
