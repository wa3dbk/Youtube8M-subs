00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
saw after the Olympic Games and I did an

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.650 
saw after the Olympic Games and I did an
American<00:06:45.290> newspaper<00:06:45.440> that<00:06:45.860> said<00:06:46.100> I<00:06:46.130> was<00:06:46.660> the

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
American newspaper that said I was the

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.470 
American newspaper that said I was the
people's<00:06:48.080> champion<00:06:48.740> and<00:06:49.580> I<00:06:49.940> think<00:06:50.180> that<00:06:50.330> was

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
people's champion and I think that was

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.780 
people's champion and I think that was
so<00:06:50.720> so<00:06:51.260> beautiful<00:06:51.740> and<00:06:51.860> so<00:06:52.070> special<00:06:52.490> because

so so beautiful and so special because

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.230 
so so beautiful and so special because
in<00:06:53.780> Vancouver<00:06:54.410> I<00:06:54.440> felt<00:06:54.830> that<00:06:55.070> I<00:06:55.310> wouldn't<00:06:56.000> win

in Vancouver I felt that I wouldn't win
a<00:06:56.270> medal<00:06:56.480> because<00:06:57.670> for<00:06:58.670> politics<00:06:59.240> and<00:06:59.600> lots<00:07:00.110> of

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.750 
a medal because for politics and lots of
different<00:07:00.650> reasons<00:07:00.800> I<00:07:01.130> didn't<00:07:01.430> think<00:07:01.580> it<00:07:01.700> was

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760
