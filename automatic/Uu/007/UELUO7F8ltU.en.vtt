them and move on to the next one until

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.810 
them and move on to the next one until
you<00:04:07.880> get<00:04:08.030> your<00:04:08.150> 15<00:04:11.920> once<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.370> 15

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
you get your 15 once you have the 15

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.259 
you get your 15 once you have the 15
orcs<00:04:14.240> killed<00:04:14.660> go<00:04:15.380> ahead<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.890> go<00:04:16.850> find<00:04:17.120> the

dragon again he flies really really slow

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.860 
dragon again he flies really really slow
so<00:04:20.560> he'll<00:04:21.560> probably<00:04:21.590> be<00:04:22.280> quite<00:04:22.970> close<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.750> the

so he'll probably be quite close to the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.720 
so he'll probably be quite close to the
area<00:04:24.050> where<00:04:24.440> you<00:04:24.680> were<00:04:24.860> before<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.520> if<00:04:25.610> you

area where you were before so if you

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.220 
area where you were before so if you
