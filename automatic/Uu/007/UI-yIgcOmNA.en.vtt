00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.940
 Hi everyone, let's give it a try 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:15.630
 comparison of the new upgrade of the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:19.109
 firmware of the fujifilm xt10 focus as 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.420
 better than the previous version 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:29.539
 version 4.0 then currently has a 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.300
 mounted a 35 mm moons 4 on the machine 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.360
 which is a good goal but it's enough 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.340
 slow in the auto focus and above all 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 keep making movements either 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 and ignition both before putting on 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:53.579
 fire 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:55.949
 I'll let you hear noise you don't have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 heard the autofocus keep going 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.250
 forward back to find the fire 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 although it is much faster than 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.180
 to firmware version 1.0 is 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 however a little slow compared to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
 reflex camera 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.340
 we'll see later with the new firmware as 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.340
 will behave of you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.729
 here is the new exhaust is stalled 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.030
 firmware and then let's see how it behaves 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.030
 with the new firmware on the machine 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.080
 ok i downloaded the firmware on the card 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.730
 it's not love cards now we insert it e 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:23.270
 we upgrade by being crushed 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:25.520
 of shining and turning on the machine yes 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.989
 ok 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.270
 we select the lesson body from 3 11 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:41.010
 at 4 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:47.100
 ok ok now we will see that it will take us 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 about a minute to update that 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.480
 when all the bars are marked 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.480
 it means that it will be ready 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.940
 it's a minute it seems very long 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.940
 obviously 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.980
 ok upgrade completed with enough 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.980
 turn off the camera, turn it back on 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.799
 we should have the new features 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:57.799
 here they are in fact we come that there are i 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.709
 marks no longer highlighted in white 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:05.530
 blacks as before instead they were all 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:09.049
 blacks nobody we try my name is 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.790
 turn on and see if the autofocus is 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:19.699
 already faster without touching any 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:26.960
 so it seems a little bit more 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:29.320
 fast we close the settings of 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.320
 auto focus 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.150
 single point area 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.340
 strongly turned on when the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.510
 blank detection on there is also new 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.090
 this new function that the arrival from 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.610
 eye detection then put on 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:13.930
 fire directly on the eyes myself 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:15.820
 unfortunately no face to which no 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.950
 so I can't prove it but see 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:29.640
 since multiple selection works 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:29.640
 very well very fast also took care of 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:45.269
 unfortunately I can't try with subjects 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:48.459
 movie international is really accurate 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:50.139
 and it will be good to test it with some 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.479
 moving subject 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.419
 ok i 'm going to see it doesn't work e 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.050
 then let him know how they work 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.050
 Hello
