00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.170 
going to fold it kind of upside down and
what<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.400> I'm<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.700> use

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.170 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
very<00:01:51.630> small<00:01:51.720> strokes<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.250> chip<00:01:53.670> away<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
very small strokes to chip away at the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.750 
very small strokes to chip away at the
end<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.600> pencil<00:01:55.310> what<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
end of the pencil what that's going to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.950 
end of the pencil what that's going to
do<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:58.640> start<00:01:59.640> to<00:02:00.150> form<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
do is it's going to start to form the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
do is it's going to start to form the
end<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> pencil<00:02:01.500> into<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.860> point<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.430> could

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
end of the pencil into a point I could

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.670 
end of the pencil into a point I could
do<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:03.630> sanding<00:02:04.020> pad<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.440> wanted

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
do this with the sanding pad if I wanted

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.230 
do this with the sanding pad if I wanted
to<00:02:04.830> but<00:02:04.980> it<00:02:05.010> would<00:02:05.100> take<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.610> longer<00:02:05.850> time

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to but it would take a much longer time

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.090 
to but it would take a much longer time
so<00:02:06.600> by<00:02:06.720> using<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.110> razor<00:02:07.290> blade<00:02:07.620> holding<00:02:08.010> it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
so by using the razor blade holding it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.790 
so by using the razor blade holding it
upside<00:02:08.369> down<00:02:08.400> like<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.180> taking<00:02:10.140> just

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
upside down like that and taking just

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 
upside down like that and taking just
very<00:02:11.010> small<00:02:11.600> strokes<00:02:12.600> off<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.080> end<00:02:13.230> it's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
very small strokes off of the end it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.570 
very small strokes off of the end it's
going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> sharpen<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.040> down<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> point<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
going to sharpen it down to a point a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.890 
going to sharpen it down to a point a
curious<00:02:17.580> thing<00:02:17.700> about<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> video<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.600> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
curious thing about the video is that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.810 
curious thing about the video is that
it's<00:02:19.170> been<00:02:19.350> reversed<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.220> looks<00:02:20.490> like<00:02:20.670> I'm

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
it's been reversed so it looks like I'm

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's been reversed so it looks like I'm
holding<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.210> razor<00:02:21.390> blade<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.870> my<00:02:22.020> left

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
holding the razor blade with my left

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.990 
holding the razor blade with my left
hand<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.920> actually<00:02:23.310> normally<00:02:23.610> hold<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:23.970> my

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
hand I actually normally hold it with my

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.140 
hand I actually normally hold it with my
right<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.810> doesn't<00:02:25.140> really<00:02:25.260> matter<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.610> for

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
right it doesn't really matter but for

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.820 
right it doesn't really matter but for
those<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.660> who<00:02:27.840> are<00:02:27.930> right-handed<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.650> I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
those of you who are right-handed like I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.410 
those of you who are right-handed like I
am<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.280> might<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.520> more<00:02:29.700> comfortable<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
am it might be more comfortable to do it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.120 
am it might be more comfortable to do it
the<00:02:30.480> other<00:02:30.510> way<00:02:30.660> around<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:33.620> there<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.710> go<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the other way around so there you go you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.900 
the other way around so there you go you
can<00:02:35.520> see<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:36.120> roughly<00:02:36.510> sharpened<00:02:37.760> now<00:02:38.760> I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
can see it's roughly sharpened now I'm

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.780 
can see it's roughly sharpened now I'm
going<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> take<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.420> sanding<00:02:39.840> pad<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:41.430> going

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
going to take the sanding pad I'm going

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.650 
going to take the sanding pad I'm going
to<00:02:43.130> press<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> pencil<00:02:44.610> against<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> sanding

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
to press a pencil against the sanding

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.150 
to press a pencil against the sanding
pad<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.080> kind<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:46.890> bit<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
pad in kind of a little bit of a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.680 
pad in kind of a little bit of a
circular<00:02:47.400> motion<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.209> see<00:02:48.450> how<00:02:48.570> I'm

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
circular motion and you can see how I'm

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.340 
circular motion and you can see how I'm
rotating<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> pencil<00:02:49.770> as<00:02:50.630> I<00:02:51.630> am<00:02:51.750> sanding<00:02:52.230> it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
rotating the pencil as I am sanding it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.790 
rotating the pencil as I am sanding it
to<00:02:52.800> get<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> smooth<00:02:53.400> finish<00:02:54.590> all<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> way

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
to get a smooth finish all the way

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.340 
to get a smooth finish all the way
around<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:57.900> check<00:02:58.110> out<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
around and you can check out the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.660 
around and you can check out the
drawings<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:58.950> with<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.400> kind<00:02:59.550> of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
drawings that I do with this kind of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.790 
drawings that I do with this kind of
charcoal<00:03:00.030> pencil<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.480> my<00:03:00.600> book<00:03:00.900> fundamentals
