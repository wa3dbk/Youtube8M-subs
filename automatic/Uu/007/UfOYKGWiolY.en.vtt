00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 well we are already in the recovery mode 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.259
 now we are going to install the persie channel 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.400
 10 which is very simple where it says 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.730
 apply you from sidecar let's go 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.480
 back to the globe on a motorcycle 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 to this one we select the middle button 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.509
 we enter we go down with the key to go up and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.329
 lower the volume where it says moon and 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.610
 media voting program and 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:34.699
 we think they can ride the four 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.710
 first a mold dates an amount sd card 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.769
 consist and an amount the first four 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 they have to say an amount we go back 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.260
 backwards 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.940
 install from sd touch the button of the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.930
 medium I do not know if sdk we touch the button on 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 half there we look for the card 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 there is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.969
 with the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.360
 jg in us 10 if we touch the button of the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.409
 medium and we go down to where it says is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.259
 install channel 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.370
 we play back the middle button there 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.680
 it is already installing 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.440
 this is preferable that we wait 5 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.900
 seconds as it says there once of the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.670
 installation we wait more or less 5 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.670
 seconds approximately 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.820
 we play back we go with the little arrow 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.450
 we put back we hope some 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.899
 seconds to return to the menu 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.780
 and with the middle key we touch rebound 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:43.909
 sister we press and you're already 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 restarting the cell phone and now we wait 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.229
 for I'm going to go into the configuration 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.469
 so you can see how it was 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.750
 installed the channel but if 10 it is 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.109
 compatible with the rom that we just 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.109
 go up 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.880
 sometimes it takes a little bit but they have 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.880
 patience that will immediately start 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.530
 there it is starting 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.530
 48 years 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.530
 good 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.680
 have patience and cellular vigor and so 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.770
 that everything is fine 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.660
 there he is back 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.850
 there is to boot 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.680
 perfect compatibility with the carnal 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.680
 without any problems 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.560
 we go to the configuration 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.120
 I'm going to teach one thing a little trick 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.549
 another fritz cpu control we open it 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.000
 they have to be at minimum frequency 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:16.350
 of the clock 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.790
 312 in governor we press we are going to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.260
 put leon hearts 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.040
 and where it says that the unification of that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.909
 we play and we're going to put them 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.219
 apply the start apply we hope 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.420
 a few seconds and the super user is going 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:38.840
 to say simply we can afford 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.040
 accept and it is already configured 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 we go to the configuration 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.540
