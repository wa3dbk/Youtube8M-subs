 bee products are real

 source of life which is not all people 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.240
 perceived properly by

 him indifferent here we'll talk in 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.260
 particularly one of them ambrosia 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.539
 this is a unique natural product 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.490

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.440
 pollen particles are attracted to her 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.620
 then she deftly collect her paws with

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.270
 the same operation will be done and the rest 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.850
 then upon reaching the right amount 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.220

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.579
 perga turns out 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.710
 in fact it is pollen bees tamped 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.770

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.709
 perga is well digested and is not 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:38.819
 an allergen since lactic acid has passed 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.500

 the composition of the pollen in it includes all 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.459
 vitamins necessary for man and 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.139
 essential amino acids are those that are not

 can be synthesized in our body 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:14.129
 and must come with food 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:17.549

 Sugar in perge significantly more than 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.290
 pollen has less fat and protein 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.450
 but they are better absorbed and mineral 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.850
 substances and several times more

 regulating the most important biochemical 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.900
 processes and playing an important role in 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.850
 The metabolism of perga is rich in 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.480
 potassium and iron cobalt copper also in 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.470
 it contains calcium magnesium zinc

 manganese phosphorus 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.900
 chrome iodine and others in perga I collected

 antioxidant antitumor and 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.330
 choleretic effect of its composition depends 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.840
 from plants from which was collected 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.100
 pollen therefore each batch of perga has 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.890
 not the same composition 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.930
 but regardless of the composition of any 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.390
 perga produced by bees has 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.590
 high nutritional and energy 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.360
 value dose of perga to them for an adult 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.630
 person depending on the purpose 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.990
 applications it ranges from 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.880
 10 to 30 grams per day if you are healthy 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.610
 prigus should be used 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.490
 from 10 to 15 grams per day in order 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.280
 prophylaxis for prophylactic purposes 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.810
 better means not to find for children 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:27.920
 ranges from 70 to 100 milligrams per

 kilogram of body weight in case of illness 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.380
 dose may be increased under supervision 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.940
 no excessive use 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.720
 leads to a better healing effect 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.080
 opposite when long 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.630
 at dosage may result
