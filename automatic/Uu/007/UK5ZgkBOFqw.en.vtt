00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I'm gone to another set of strings so my

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'm gone to another set of strings so my
fingers<00:01:39.840> rather<00:01:40.560> than<00:01:40.740> being<00:01:40.860> stretched<00:01:41.100> out

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
fingers rather than being stretched out

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.710 
fingers rather than being stretched out
like<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.550> for<00:01:41.610> an<00:01:41.820> octave<00:01:42.120> they<00:01:42.330> move<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
like this for an octave they move in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.980 
like this for an octave they move in
with<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.200> fret<00:01:43.560> between<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> finger<00:01:44.810> back<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
with one fret between the finger back to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.950 
with one fret between the finger back to
the<00:01:46.080> other<00:01:46.200> position<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.420> ten<00:01:49.910> or<00:01:50.960> seven

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the other position and then ten or seven

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.310 
the other position and then ten or seven
with<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.530> first<00:01:52.740> finger<00:01:56.869> finding<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.990> chord

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
with the first finger finding that chord

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.359 
with the first finger finding that chord
you<00:01:58.500> could<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.800> think<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.040> your<00:01:59.130> triad<00:01:59.520> right

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:15.370 

there's<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.430> C<00:02:05.700> minor<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.750> arpeggio<00:02:07.410> but

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.960 

so<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> lot<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.739> times<00:02:16.890> wes<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.220> doing<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.790> lot<00:02:17.940> of

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
so a lot of times wes is doing a lot of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.120 
so a lot of times wes is doing a lot of
these<00:02:18.150> octaves<00:02:18.690> where<00:02:18.900> he's<00:02:19.050> playing<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
these octaves where he's playing on the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
these octaves where he's playing on the
upbeats<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:20.970> fan<00:02:21.300> too<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.850> know<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
upbeats one fan too you know so the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.800 
upbeats one fan too you know so the
