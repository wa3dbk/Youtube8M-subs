00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello guys with you I am Volodin this 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 already the second release of the transfer is excellent 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.390
 positions first location on the map 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.640
 sandy river is an assault and in attacking 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.020
 team until the heroes of the opposite 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 teams are trying to take some 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.220
 squares for defa for more protection 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.590
 some kind of them and all the records we 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 we push you see 400 meters in theory 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 hellcat with enemies can get but all 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 the fact is that we are allies in this 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 helps and here with those dunes chikov 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.420
 shine a plus you have about three 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 few yes you can shoot by 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.649
 watch the parties watch the minimap 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 and shoot and good damage numbers 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.570
 this barkhankak will help you with that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 the next position in the sacred valley and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.100
 in square e3 the only minus is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.520
 if you were highlighted by something very 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.620
 painfully 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.020
 Of course you need to look at the setup to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 there were no enemies of one artillery but 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.649
 you have also a pebble if you are already in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.460
 the last resort highlights were not you to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 drive up to him 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.350
 and become the best handguard 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.340
 go exactly on american tanks and for 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.380
 the declensions of their guns 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.969
 you can calmly cram exactly on 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.399
 line hd 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.960
 where the enemies are lit all the time so 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.609
 that try too nastrelivat but 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.409
 look neat best court 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.420
 go with a light bulb because 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.460
 any moment you can light and you 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.709
 will make him a very good situation and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 very few people can afford to stick el halluf 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.490
 on the counter battle feature of this time 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.649
 pawno so that someone and did not go us 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.030
 capture if you don't even highlight you 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.890
 can get a trader you become 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.350
 by such a warm pebble he you 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.090
 welcomes and withdrawal stands quietly if 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.489
 enemies will go straight for you 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.799
 mug from the balcony to you your allies 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.829
 or even sovzvodnye can help such 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.299
 they are losing opposition anyway 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.899
 you will stay in the black so 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.060
 become 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.619
 and of course don't crowd here and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.099
 because here there is room for mation 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.569
 one ensk f2 good backache 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.009
 go here and believe in the drummer 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.989
 because on the same not the fifth if 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.819
 go give one projectile here in this 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:06.159
 gap q and that's it all over on 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.679
 drummers if the enemy comes out then they donâ€™t 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.190
 leave look set 1 we build on 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.769
 I am going to harp 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.730
 Briton well at home repaired not repaired he 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.680
 so thought 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.910
 but very long and second fast finds 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.190
 Now you can go to the hangar 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.799
 recharge and and wait for the next such 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.750
 enemy pearl valley of many in general 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.639
 the question was what to do if you 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.730
 pushing the gorge from a bush can 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.000
 protect the base here is a very nice bush and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.030
 on 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.430
 of 5 but there is of course minus 1 this is very 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.889
 far you shoot there 450 mg 550 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.150
 meters and therefore it is necessary that at least 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.760
 someone from your allies or 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.069
 sovzvodnogo stood on the backlight without it 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.739
 you do n't really shoot anything 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.109
 here the whole topic in these bushes is that 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.419
 even if the enemies are in the center or even 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.160
 pushes you brilliant green bushes absolutely 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.160
 all sides and when will you shoot 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.430
 Well, with such a small special 4 unlikely 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.109
 do you highlight even with 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.239
 opened zelenka so you can safely 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.189
 shoot tune well of course 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.620
 It happens that the art will take in the first 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.629
 in the light but with you I will repeat again 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.000
 it will be very hard to light and therefore 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.010
 on shoot it will be quite real to them 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.170
 many who do that so you too 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.420
 I advise this position yourself now 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.400
 I start to use well, it works 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.889
 again not in all cases this if you 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.510
 pushed through the gorge and if from someone on 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.480
 backlight base then you can be nice 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.569
 better shoot and of course completes 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.129
 I really liked this position 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.349
 a place i have such a super tasty name 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.019
 sherry can someone know him the first time 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.209
 saw d7 bush notice how not to 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.109
 travel around a path like this 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.720
 drive in 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.700
 and shine everything that moves first 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.790
 the mountain was driven right away 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.310
 flying heaps of damage also moving up for 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.590
 gorochka and now look from all sides 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.269
 you see the bushes are also such circular and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.340
 you just if you stand 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.290
 quietly no need then no you 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.480
 how not to shine well here he breaks 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.400
 tree he was lucky that the enemies just did not 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.500
 understand what happened in general guys 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.299
