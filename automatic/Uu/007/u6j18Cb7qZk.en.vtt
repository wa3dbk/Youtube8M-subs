00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
today in the show I'm gonna be answering

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.760 
today in the show I'm gonna be answering
a<00:00:02.190> question<00:00:02.340> just<00:00:03.330> what<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.230> emotional

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
a question just what is the emotional

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:19.420 
a question just what is the emotional
spectrum<00:00:05.069> from<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.089> green<00:00:06.299> lantern<00:00:06.870> titles

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.370 

so<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> emotional<00:00:21.060> spectrum<00:00:21.150> from<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> DC

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so the emotional spectrum from the DC

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.259 
so the emotional spectrum from the DC
Universe<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.100> essentially<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> colors<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
Universe is essentially the colors of

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.990 
Universe is essentially the colors of
the<00:00:24.420> rainbows<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.289> each<00:00:25.769> color<00:00:26.160> represents<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the rainbows and each color represents a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630 
the rainbows and each color represents a
different<00:00:27.539> emotion<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.500> two<00:00:28.740> emotions<00:00:29.429> on

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
different emotion the two emotions on

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
different emotion the two emotions on
the<00:00:29.760> farthest<00:00:30.240> ends<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> spectrum<00:00:31.230> are

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the farthest ends of the spectrum are

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.760 
the farthest ends of the spectrum are
rage<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> love<00:00:33.180> represented<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.200> red<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
rage and love represented by red and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.760 
rage and love represented by red and
violet<00:00:35.340> respectively<00:00:36.149> these<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.440> more

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
violet respectively these two have more

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.700 
violet respectively these two have more
power<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.520> influence<00:00:39.090> than<00:00:39.780> any<00:00:40.110> other

power and influence than any other
emotion<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> spectrum<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.079> green<00:00:43.530> which

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
emotion in the spectrum but green which

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
emotion in the spectrum but green which
is<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> dead<00:00:44.670> center<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.809> entire

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
is in the dead center of the entire

spectrum has the ability to overcome any
of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> other<00:00:50.610> emotions<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.930> because

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of the other emotions and that's because

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.069 
of the other emotions and that's because
green<00:00:52.739> represents<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:54.870> two

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
green represents will there are two

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.410 
green represents will there are two
colors<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> spectrum<00:00:56.730> due

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
colors that are not on the spectrum due

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
colors that are not on the spectrum due
to<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:58.230> being<00:00:58.500> colors<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.250> all

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to them not being colors at all

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
to them not being colors at all
technically<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.230> black<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
technically and these are black and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640 
technically and these are black and
white<00:01:02.309> black<00:01:03.120> being<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> absence<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> color

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
white black being the absence of color

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.859 
white black being the absence of color
and<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.129> represents<00:01:05.729> death<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.360> white

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and this represents death and white

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
and this represents death and white
being<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> combination<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.400> colors<00:01:08.850> and

their power rings energy so it's very

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.780 
their power rings energy so it's very

now as we're saying that Island parallax
are<00:04:11.169> very<00:04:11.319> similar<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:11.799> that<00:04:11.919> they<00:04:12.040> can<00:04:12.220> both

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
