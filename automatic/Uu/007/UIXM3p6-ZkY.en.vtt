00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
went off in that game so it was very

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.490 
went off in that game so it was very
clear<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.420> two<00:00:06.600> strategies<00:00:07.049> from<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.379> two

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
clear the two strategies from the two

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.890 
clear the two strategies from the two
teams<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.980> opening<00:00:08.370> medias<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.510> camping

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900

teams in the opening medias was camping
dyrus<00:00:10.290> as<00:00:10.500> usual<00:00:11.040> vs<00:00:11.280> TSM<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.030> centauran

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
trying to keep down sneaky there's a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.900 
trying to keep down sneaky there's a
reason<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:16.170> say<00:00:16.379> every<00:00:17.070> single<00:00:17.580> split

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
reason that we say every single split

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330 
reason that we say every single split
sneaky<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.109> consistent<00:00:19.619> performer<00:00:20.189> for

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
sneaky is this consistent performer for

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.070 
sneaky is this consistent performer for
cloud<00:00:20.550> nine<00:00:20.760> he's<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> backbone<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.779> this

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
cloud nine he's the backbone of this

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320 
cloud nine he's the backbone of this
team<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.949> saw<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:23.789> threw

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
team we saw it here they threw

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.109 
team we saw it here they threw
everything<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:25.230> sneaky<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.400> dodges<00:00:26.970> he

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
everything at sneaky and the dodges he

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
everything at sneaky and the dodges he
barely<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.230> many<00:00:28.439> times<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:29.279> took

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
barely got out so many times they took

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.550 
barely got out so many times they took
all<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.179> pressure<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.810> as<00:00:30.990> he<00:00:31.170> said<00:00:31.349> he

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
all of that pressure and as he said he

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
all of that pressure and as he said he
did<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.189> average<00:00:32.369> blade<00:00:32.910> staying

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
did it all with an average blade staying

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.290 
did it all with an average blade staying
even<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.530> CS<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.280> was<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.790> actually

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
even in CS it was it was actually

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.940 
even in CS it was it was actually
ridiculous<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.989> watch<00:00:37.140> yeah<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
ridiculous to watch yeah and then on the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.410 
ridiculous to watch yeah and then on the
flip<00:00:38.040> side<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.910> pressure<00:00:39.149> wasn't

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
flip side of that the pressure wasn't

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
flip side of that the pressure wasn't
sticking<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.079> he<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.440> diffusing<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
sticking there he was diffusing it and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
sticking there he was diffusing it and
then<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.790> were<00:00:41.850> applying<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> dyrus<00:00:43.079> on

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
then they were applying it to dyrus on

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.420 
then they were applying it to dyrus on
the<00:00:43.410> bottom<00:00:43.620> side<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.219> sticking

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the bottom side and that was sticking

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
the bottom side and that was sticking
they<00:00:44.730> killed<00:00:45.000> him<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.079> turret<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
they killed him they got the turret and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 
they killed him they got the turret and
that<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> lead<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.610> perpetuated<00:00:48.270> cloud

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that was the lead that perpetuated cloud

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
that was the lead that perpetuated cloud
nine<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> mid<00:00:49.590> game<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.010> gave<00:00:50.190> them

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
nine into the mid game and gave them

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150 
nine into the mid game and gave them
that<00:00:50.460> 5k<00:00:50.730> gold<00:00:51.239> lead<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.980> really

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that 5k gold lead that was really really

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.470 
that 5k gold lead that was really really
well<00:00:53.399> played<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.030> sneaky<00:00:54.390> at

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
well played because that's all sneaky at

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.549 
well played because that's all sneaky at
that<00:00:54.600> point<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.079> let's<00:00:55.260> talk<00:00:55.410> about

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that point right so let's talk about

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.200 
that point right so let's talk about
that<00:00:55.739> lead<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.250> secured<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.030> as

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that lead that they secured because as

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
that lead that they secured because as
you<00:00:57.390> mentioned<00:00:57.539> both<00:00:58.050> teams<00:00:58.379> decided<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you mentioned both teams decided to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
you mentioned both teams decided to
throw<00:00:59.100> pressure<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> opposite<00:01:00.180> sides<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
throw pressure on the opposite sides of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.209 
throw pressure on the opposite sides of
the<00:01:00.570> map<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.960> had<00:01:01.079> TSM<00:01:01.500> pressuring<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> top

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the map we had TSM pressuring the top

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100 
the map we had TSM pressuring the top
side<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> bottom<00:01:03.300> lanes<00:01:03.539> yeah<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

think<00:02:24.030> TSM<00:02:24.600> needs<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.810> work<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.110> their<00:02:25.230> vision

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
think TSM needs to work on their vision

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.810 
think TSM needs to work on their vision
control<00:02:25.680> when<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.130> kill<00:02:26.370> somebody<00:02:26.580> because

instead knowing that there's a lack of
vision<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.780> side<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:00.989> TSM<00:03:01.470> they<00:03:02.070> set<00:03:02.400> up

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
vision on the side of TSM they set up

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.940 
vision on the side of TSM they set up
their<00:03:02.730> vision<00:03:03.150> stand<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.989> brush<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.620> as

their vision stand in the brush and as

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.380 
their vision stand in the brush and as
you<00:03:05.070> said<00:03:05.280> yes<00:03:05.489> there's<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.820> possibility<00:03:05.970> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
you said yes there's the possibility of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.810 
you said yes there's the possibility of
prey<00:03:06.660> seeker<00:03:07.050> checking<00:03:07.500> those<00:03:07.739> those<00:03:08.280> bushes

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
prey seeker checking those those bushes

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.180

before they go run range range and a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.770 
before they go run range range and a
carrot<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:11.550> he<00:03:11.610> might<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.300> used<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.690> on

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
carrot now he might have just used it on

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.280 
carrot now he might have just used it on
the<00:03:13.430> mid<00:03:14.430> lane<00:03:14.700> brush<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.720> he<00:03:15.989> may<00:03:16.140> have<00:03:16.170> just

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the mid lane brush so he may have just

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.600 
the mid lane brush so he may have just
used<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> check<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.489> because

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
used it to check that one because

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.949 
used it to check that one because
there's<00:03:17.820> multiple<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.360> what<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.780> we

there's multiple one what we have we
have<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.320> replay<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:19.980> let's<00:03:20.130> pull<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.400> up<00:03:20.489> and
