00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.120
 First of all, it is a special attack. 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.870
 But 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.040
 What is the companion Patburn training method shot 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.129
 It's up until then 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.129
 Please take a look at it 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.140
 First of all is the origin of the name 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.350
 The origin of the name is ぇ I took the initial of such things 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.269
 It has become a thing 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.019
 This is the first thing about this correction for shots ss 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.970
 is 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.820
 Equivalent interval training 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.850
 Circuit training 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.900
 It is this two s This two s 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220
 It is a part of the circuit training circuit 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.680
 Hey I want to go over 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.630
 It is sce 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.980
 In 8 years ago, it is the same task if it is Japanese, so I am root 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.240
 The fact that the association can take the lead is also included 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.680
 Please understand in 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.490
 I want to say that the final, but this is 4 before 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.330
 It is as it is, but it seems to be a short interval relay 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.850
 That kind of training that you can do with 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 If you take an interval to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.420
 Contrasted 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.600
 Circuit training is one after another 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 0 people like to go out without a break 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 Such as going from 3 types of ema to 4 printing 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.020
 Training mode With circuit training 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.520
 Says 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.630
 I'm eleven, this is too much 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.190
 I think it is an unfamiliar word, but the cup intensity 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.860
 Ali intensity 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.010
 I'm doing intelligible 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.400
 The word 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.700
 You can translate 2 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.790
 It loses 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270
 So it is engineering Kyoto 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.650
 It is h of high man exhibition four seasons h 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.800
 This is 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.860
 f shot ps2s writer 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.390
 I am doing this 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.610
 Application is it 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.200
 Yoshijo max 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.570
 This is pretty much the same, is there such support? 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.750
 I don't know a bit 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.980
洲 four degree oxygen 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.599
 So that it is the exercise that takes in as much as possible 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.259
 Such elements have such elements 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.059
 Aerobic aerobic exercise regular such in this sense 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.989
 It has spread 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.909
 You are a shot 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.589
 The term of Este No. 1 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.969
 In fact 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.409
 This is also a trend Well from such a place 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.839
 It's a kind of proud training method 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.619
 Make a shot method and say it is soft 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.229
 That's where the name came from
