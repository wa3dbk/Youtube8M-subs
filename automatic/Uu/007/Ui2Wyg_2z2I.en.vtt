00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it was recommended that I tried wonder

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.260 
it was recommended that I tried wonder
under<00:02:01.020> however<00:02:01.680> stitch<00:02:01.950> witchery<00:02:02.219> was<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.670> lot

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
under however stitch witchery was a lot

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.330 
under however stitch witchery was a lot
less<00:02:03.479> expensive

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
less expensive

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.999 
less expensive
so<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.689> just<00:02:05.869> use<00:02:06.079> that<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.590> even<00:02:06.740> though<00:02:06.920> it

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
so I just use that and even though it

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.410 
so I just use that and even though it
doesn't<00:02:07.130> have<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> paper<00:02:07.549> backing<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.149> found

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
doesn't have a paper backing I found

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.680 
doesn't have a paper backing I found
that<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.869> seasoned<00:02:09.200> process<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.649> fine<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.690> it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
that the seasoned process is fine and it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.559 
that the seasoned process is fine and it
worked<00:02:11.900> rather<00:02:12.200> well<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:13.209> didn't<00:02:14.209> give<00:02:14.330> me<00:02:14.450> too

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
worked rather well it didn't give me too

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.089 
worked rather well it didn't give me too
many<00:02:14.690> wrinkles<00:02:15.170> or<00:02:15.380> any<00:02:15.530> problems<00:02:15.950> or

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
many wrinkles or any problems or

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.330 
many wrinkles or any problems or
anything<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.640> that's<00:02:16.819> good<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.470> yes<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.920> was

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
anything so that's good so yes it was

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.830 
anything so that's good so yes it was
fused<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.760> herringbone<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.420> teal<00:02:20.630> which<00:02:20.810> is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
fused to herringbone to teal which is

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.140 
fused to herringbone to teal which is
the<00:02:21.050> inner<00:02:21.200> lining<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.400> inside<00:02:22.849> lining

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the inner lining and the inside lining

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.250 
the inner lining and the inside lining
are<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> ready<00:02:23.690> for<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:23.989> are<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:25.069> ready<00:02:25.130> oh

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.870 

so<00:02:30.260> that's<00:02:30.440> why<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.709> call<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.250> Sebastien

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
so that's why I call this the Sebastien

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.150 
so that's why I call this the Sebastien
corset<00:02:32.330> because<00:02:32.690> my<00:02:33.319> brother<00:02:33.620> came<00:02:33.830> into<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
corset because my brother came into the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.589 
corset because my brother came into the
room<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.640> was<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:34.819> finishing<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.450> this

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
room as I was just finishing up this

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.199 
room as I was just finishing up this
corset<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.530> he<00:02:37.310> said<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.060> little

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
corset and he said I was a little

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.050 
corset and he said I was a little
mermaid<00:02:38.600> corset<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.370> outside<00:02:40.790> looks

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
mermaid corset and the outside looks

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.059 
mermaid corset and the outside looks
crustacean<00:02:42.049> red<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.470> looks<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.769> cooked

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
crustacean red it looks like a cooked

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.280 
crustacean red it looks like a cooked
crustacean<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.420> wasn't<00:02:44.750> really<00:02:44.930> planning

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
crustacean so I wasn't really planning

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.809 
crustacean so I wasn't really planning
it<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.769> but<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.040> really<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.519> how<00:02:46.670> it

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
it that way but I really like how it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.240 
it that way but I really like how it
turned<00:02:47.060> out<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.049> named<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.830> Sebastian

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
turned out so I named this the Sebastian

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.180 
turned out so I named this the Sebastian
corset<00:02:49.760> after<00:02:50.180> Sebastian<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.110> crab<00:02:51.190> so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
corset after Sebastian the crab so

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.650 
corset after Sebastian the crab so
here's<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.640> close-up<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.120> lining<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.569> you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
here's a close-up of the lining and you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.360 
here's a close-up of the lining and you
can<00:02:53.810> see<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:53.989> centered<00:02:54.440> Ariel<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.010> middle

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
can see I centered Ariel in the middle

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.229 
can see I centered Ariel in the middle
of<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.000> panel<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.760> how<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.970> turned

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
of the panel you can see how that turned

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.600 
of the panel you can see how that turned
out<00:02:59.390> there<00:03:00.230> are<00:03:00.319> three<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.860> side<00:03:00.920> and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
out there are three on this side and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.839 
out there are three on this side and
then<00:03:01.849> on<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.420> other<00:03:02.450> side<00:03:02.959> there<00:03:03.650> are<00:03:03.849> another

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
then on the other side there are another

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.280 
then on the other side there are another
two<00:03:05.180> right<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:07.209> what<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.239> rather<00:03:08.720> didn't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
two right there what I rather didn't

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.440 
two right there what I rather didn't
like<00:03:09.500> about<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:10.130> lining<00:03:10.640> was<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.329> was<00:03:11.420> a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
like about this lining was that it was a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.509 
like about this lining was that it was a
very<00:03:11.690> thin<00:03:12.260> quilting<00:03:12.829> cotton<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:13.489> I

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
very thin quilting cotton so what I

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.060 
very thin quilting cotton so what I
probably<00:03:13.880> should<00:03:14.359> have<00:03:14.630> done<00:03:14.870> was<00:03:15.470> interface

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
probably should have done was interface

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.349 
probably should have done was interface
this<00:03:16.250> cotton<00:03:16.959> or<00:03:18.310> not<00:03:19.310> made<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.850> floating

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
this cotton or not made it a floating

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.270 
this cotton or not made it a floating
panel<00:03:20.569> because<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:21.049> found<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.799> tended<00:03:22.250> to

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
panel because I found that it tended to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.580 
panel because I found that it tended to
stretch<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.239> warp<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.780> lot<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.109> I<00:03:24.200> was<00:03:24.350> sewing

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
stretch and warp a lot as I was sewing

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.699 
stretch and warp a lot as I was sewing
it<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:26.299> moving<00:03:26.569> on<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.900> construction<00:03:27.500> I

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
it so moving on to the construction I

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.309 
it so moving on to the construction I
did<00:03:28.370> both<00:03:28.819> flat<00:03:29.209> felled<00:03:29.390> seam<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:29.959> basically

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
did both flat felled seam so basically

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.830 
did both flat felled seam so basically
they<00:03:30.500> were<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:30.769> top<00:03:30.980> stitched<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:32.329> find

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
they were just top stitched and I find

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.750 
they were just top stitched and I find
that<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.079> be<00:03:33.230> very<00:03:33.350> strong<00:03:34.010> it's<00:03:34.220> starting<00:03:34.639> to

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
that to be very strong it's starting to

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.460 
that to be very strong it's starting to
be<00:03:34.880> my<00:03:35.090> favorite<00:03:35.540> method<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.019> construction

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
be my favorite method of construction

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.620 
be my favorite method of construction
and<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.489> said<00:03:37.700> we<00:03:37.819> who<00:03:37.940> are<00:03:38.000> on<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.209> inside

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
and like I said we who are on the inside

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.420 
and like I said we who are on the inside
it's<00:03:39.049> just<00:03:39.139> a<00:03:39.410> floating<00:03:39.709> liner<00:03:40.069> which<00:03:40.310> is

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
it's just a floating liner which is

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.460 
it's just a floating liner which is
attached<00:03:40.730> at<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> first<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.019> last<00:03:42.170> panel

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
attached at the first and the last panel

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.190 
attached at the first and the last panel
is<00:03:42.709> right<00:03:42.889> there<00:03:43.510> there's<00:03:44.510> also<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.840> one<00:03:45.049> inch

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
is right there there's also a one inch

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.690 
is right there there's also a one inch
wide<00:03:45.350> waist<00:03:45.620> tape<00:03:45.829> running<00:03:46.069> through<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
wide waist tape running through the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.699 
wide waist tape running through the
entire<00:03:47.329> width<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.870> corset<00:03:48.380> hidden

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
entire width of the corset hidden

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.280 
entire width of the corset hidden
between<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.130> different<00:03:50.030> layers<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.139> can

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
between the different layers and I can

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.720 
between the different layers and I can
see<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.410> little<00:03:51.590> bit<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.889> this<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.280> an<00:03:52.370> outline

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
see a little bit of this in an outline

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.690 
see a little bit of this in an outline
beneath<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.540> satin<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.980> don't<00:03:55.549> really

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
beneath the satin and I don't really

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.460 
beneath the satin and I don't really
mind<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.120> but<00:03:56.299> if<00:03:56.450> some<00:03:56.750> people<00:03:56.989> do<00:03:57.230> mind

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
mind that but if some people do mind

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.020 
mind that but if some people do mind
that<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.950> basically<00:03:58.130> all<00:03:58.579> they<00:03:58.670> have<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.880> do

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
that and basically all they have to do

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.059 
that and basically all they have to do
is<00:03:59.239> stop<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.690> waste<00:03:59.870> tape<00:04:00.109> at<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.709> seam

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
is stop the waste tape at the seam

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.949 
is stop the waste tape at the seam
between<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.760> first<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.120> second<00:04:02.480> channel<00:04:02.780> so

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
between the first and second channel so

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.720 
between the first and second channel so
that<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.230> doesn't<00:04:03.500> go<00:04:03.590> over<00:04:03.920> at<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> bones<00:04:04.340> or

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
that it doesn't go over at the bones or

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.539 
that it doesn't go over at the bones or
the<00:04:04.760> bust<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.620> bias<00:04:06.829> tape<00:04:07.040> is<00:04:07.190> made<00:04:07.340> out

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
the bust and the bias tape is made out

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.340 
the bust and the bias tape is made out
of<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.760> same<00:04:07.970> red<00:04:08.269> satin<00:04:08.569> cut<00:04:08.959> on<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.200> bias

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
of the same red satin cut on the bias

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.030 
of the same red satin cut on the bias
and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
and

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.770 
and
and<00:04:10.129> it<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.489> machine-stitched<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.689> the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
and it is machine-stitched on the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.899 
and it is machine-stitched on the
outside<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.469> then<00:04:12.860> here<00:04:13.069> on<00:04:13.189> the<00:04:13.280> inside<00:04:13.670> it

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
outside and then here on the inside it

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.300 
outside and then here on the inside it
was<00:04:14.090> hand-stitched<00:04:14.719> and<00:04:14.930> visibly<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.799> I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
was hand-stitched and visibly and I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.120 
was hand-stitched and visibly and I
spent<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.639> lot<00:04:16.880> of<00:04:16.910> time<00:04:17.209> matching<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:18.049> up<00:04:18.199> here

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
spent a lot of time matching it up here

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.009 
spent a lot of time matching it up here
at<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.639> top<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.120> bottom<00:04:20.239> both<00:04:20.750> in<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
at the top and the bottom both in the

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.659 
at the top and the bottom both in the
front<00:04:21.229> in<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.410> back<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:21.949> rather<00:04:22.250> liked<00:04:22.520> how

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
front in the back and I rather liked how

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.560 
front in the back and I rather liked how
it<00:04:22.820> turned<00:04:23.060> out

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
it turned out

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.629 
it turned out
these<00:04:24.080> external<00:04:24.470> boning<00:04:24.949> channels<00:04:25.280> here<00:04:25.460> they

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
these external boning channels here they

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.159 
these external boning channels here they
are<00:04:25.729> functional<00:04:26.180> boning<00:04:26.539> channels<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:26.990> they

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
are functional boning channels so they

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.629 
are functional boning channels so they
actually<00:04:27.320> have<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> bones<00:04:27.860> inside<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.490> these

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
actually have the bones inside of these

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.900 
actually have the bones inside of these
I<00:04:28.970> made<00:04:29.900> them<00:04:30.229> out<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.620> basically<00:04:31.460> sewing

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
I made them out of basically sewing

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.700 
I made them out of basically sewing
kuchela<00:04:32.210> into<00:04:32.479> tubes<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.020> then<00:04:33.169> covering

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
kuchela into tubes and then covering

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.760 
kuchela into tubes and then covering
them<00:04:34.009> with<00:04:34.039> the<00:04:34.580> same<00:04:34.970> colored<00:04:35.360> red<00:04:35.570> satin<00:04:35.870> and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
them with the same colored red satin and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.740 
them with the same colored red satin and
stitching<00:04:37.100> at<00:04:37.220> them<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.669> was<00:04:38.419> a<00:04:38.479> little

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
stitching at them I was a little

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.430 
stitching at them I was a little
experimental<00:04:39.410> in<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.680> case<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.449> used<00:04:41.449> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
experimental in this case I used the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.240 
experimental in this case I used the
same<00:04:42.919> satin<00:04:43.400> as<00:04:43.550> on<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.300> panel<00:04:44.840> but<00:04:45.169> I<00:04:45.320> cut<00:04:45.620> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
same satin as on the panel but I cut the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.730 
same satin as on the panel but I cut the
satin<00:04:46.880> across<00:04:47.599> the<00:04:47.810> grain<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.289> channels

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
satin across the grain for the channels

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.589 
satin across the grain for the channels
instead<00:04:48.979> of<00:04:49.099> on<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> grain<00:04:49.759> like<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.180> did<00:04:50.360> for

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
instead of on the grain like I did for

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.170 
instead of on the grain like I did for
the<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:51.259> panels<00:04:51.740> here<00:04:52.070> so<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.849> gives<00:04:53.030> them

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
the for the panels here so it gives them

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.790 
the for the panels here so it gives them
a<00:04:53.300> different<00:04:53.419> kind<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.900> reflection<00:04:54.259> depending

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
a different kind of reflection depending

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.230 
a different kind of reflection depending
on<00:04:54.889> their<00:04:55.039> angle<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.639> you're<00:04:55.759> looking<00:04:56.120> at

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
on their angle that you're looking at

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.629 
on their angle that you're looking at
the<00:04:56.389> corset<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:57.440> in<00:04:57.740> bright<00:04:57.979> light<00:04:58.220> looking<00:04:58.520> at

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
the corset so in bright light looking at

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.969 
the corset so in bright light looking at
the<00:04:58.729> corset<00:04:59.030> head<00:04:59.210> on<00:04:59.330> as<00:04:59.570> you<00:04:59.690> see<00:04:59.900> here<00:05:00.440> then

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
the corset head on as you see here then

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.129 
the corset head on as you see here then
it<00:05:01.820> all<00:05:01.970> looks<00:05:02.210> like<00:05:02.389> that<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:02.660> know<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.930> same

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
it all looks like that you know the same

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.749 
it all looks like that you know the same
material<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.740> same<00:05:03.919> color<00:05:04.190> it<00:05:04.340> looks<00:05:04.370> very

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
material the same color it looks very

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.029 
material the same color it looks very
congruent<00:05:05.139> however<00:05:06.139> if<00:05:06.349> you<00:05:06.470> look<00:05:06.650> at<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.919> with

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
congruent however if you look at it with

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.189 
congruent however if you look at it with
life<00:05:07.280> on<00:05:07.460> an<00:05:07.610> angle<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.479> channels<00:05:08.900> almost

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
life on an angle the channels almost

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.810 
life on an angle the channels almost
seem<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.650> glow<00:05:09.800> against<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.430> rest<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.729> the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
seem to glow against the rest of the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.400 
seem to glow against the rest of the
corset<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.389> I'm<00:05:11.599> not<00:05:11.780> sure<00:05:11.960> if<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.199> would<00:05:12.289> be

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
corset and I'm not sure if you would be

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:21.300 
corset and I'm not sure if you would be
able<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.650> see<00:05:12.889> here<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:14.150> will<00:05:14.330> put<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:14.990> picture

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.400 

and<00:05:22.060> you<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.240> see<00:05:22.420> here<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.020> boning

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
and you can see here that the boning

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.050 
and you can see here that the boning
channels<00:05:23.680> have<00:05:23.830> contrast<00:05:24.370> stitching<00:05:24.730> I

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
channels have contrast stitching I

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.370 
channels have contrast stitching I
stitch<00:05:25.270> them<00:05:25.480> with<00:05:25.570> black<00:05:25.810> thread<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.260> match

stitch them with black thread to match

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
as the ones in my setter so they were

especially<00:07:24.970> when<00:07:25.090> I<00:07:25.120> use<00:07:25.210> fray<00:07:25.600> stop<00:07:25.870> on<00:07:26.110> the

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430 
here are 3/8 of an inch wide so just

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.700 
here are 3/8 of an inch wide so just

I<00:07:39.979> would<00:07:40.039> probably<00:07:40.789> have<00:07:41.060> gotten<00:07:42.159> half

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:43.159

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 
because I feel that would probably have

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.420 
because I feel that would probably have
been<00:07:46.789> sturdier<00:07:47.509> and<00:07:47.949> that's<00:07:48.949> all<00:07:49.129> for<00:07:49.340> this
