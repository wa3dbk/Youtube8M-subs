want to answer some questions about the

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.170 
want to answer some questions about the
solar<00:00:04.170> can<00:00:04.470> heater<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.040> felt<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.700> about<00:00:05.970> two

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
solar can heater I felt this about two

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.220 
solar can heater I felt this about two
weeks<00:00:06.359> ago<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.690> I've<00:00:06.810> gotten<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> lot<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
weeks ago and I've gotten a lot of

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.980 
weeks ago and I've gotten a lot of
questions<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.240> what<00:00:09.240> can<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:09.660> with<00:00:09.809> this

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
questions on what can you do with this

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.350 
questions on what can you do with this
first<00:00:10.469> thing<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:11.190> I've<00:00:11.340> been<00:00:11.490> asked<00:00:11.849> was

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
first thing that I've been asked was

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.150 
first thing that I've been asked was
what's<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> maximum<00:00:13.320> temperature<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.889> today

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
what's the maximum temperature and today

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180 
what's the maximum temperature and today
the<00:00:14.759> temperature<00:00:15.269> coming<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.650> warm<00:00:17.039> air

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the temperature coming out the warm air

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.210 
the temperature coming out the warm air
coming<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> silicon<00:00:18.300> heater<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:19.220> 177

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
coming out of the silicon heater is 177

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.189 
coming out of the silicon heater is 177
degrees<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.480> been<00:00:21.630> sitting<00:00:21.869> around

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
degrees and it's been sitting around

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.580 
degrees and it's been sitting around
there<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.740> last<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.000> don't<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:24.750> 15<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.170> 20

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
there for last I don't know 15 or 20

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
there for last I don't know 15 or 20
minutes<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.660> my

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
minutes you can see if you can see on my

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.320 
minutes you can see if you can see on my
iPad<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.289> 45<00:00:28.740> degrees<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> today<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.210> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
iPad it's 45 degrees here today so this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.650 
iPad it's 45 degrees here today so this
has<00:00:30.510> been<00:00:30.660> out<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> Sun<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:32.309> two<00:00:32.969> hours

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
has been out in the Sun for two hours

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600 
has been out in the Sun for two hours
the<00:00:34.260> thermometer<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.829> been<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.219> maybe

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the thermometer has been in there maybe

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
the thermometer has been in there maybe
20-30<00:00:36.239> minutes<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> maximum

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
20-30 minutes but the maximum

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.670 
20-30 minutes but the maximum
temperature<00:00:37.829> seems<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.579> around<00:00:39.680> 177

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
temperature seems to be around 177

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.760 
temperature seems to be around 177
degrees<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:42.360> other<00:00:42.510> question<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.469> asked

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
degrees the other question I was asked

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
degrees the other question I was asked
is<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.760> solar<00:00:45.000> heater<00:00:45.329> heat<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
is can the solar heater heat a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440 
is can the solar heater heat a
greenhouse<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.250> answer<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.610> yes<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:47.910> oh<00:00:48.180> yes

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
greenhouse the answer is yes and oh yes

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
greenhouse the answer is yes and oh yes
during<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> day<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.890> definitely<00:00:50.070> add

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
during the day it can definitely add

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.560 
during the day it can definitely add
heat<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> greenhouse<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:53.210> warm<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> air

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
heat to the greenhouse and warm the air

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.500 
heat to the greenhouse and warm the air
up<00:00:54.750> during<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.920> day<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.670> problem<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.300> solar

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
up during the day the problem with solar

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
up during the day the problem with solar
heaters<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> Sun<00:00:59.699> goes<00:00:59.879> down

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
heaters is that when the Sun goes down

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
heaters is that when the Sun goes down
if<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> Sun<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
if the Sun is not out it's not going to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.009 
if the Sun is not out it's not going to
generate<00:01:02.910> heat<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.629> there's<00:01:03.840> something

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
generate heat so there's something

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
generate heat so there's something
that's<00:01:04.320> called<00:01:04.530> thermal<00:01:05.100> mass<00:01:05.309> thermal<00:01:05.850> mass

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that's called thermal mass thermal mass

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080 
that's called thermal mass thermal mass
is<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:07.290> putting<00:01:07.830> material<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:08.939> your

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is really putting material into your

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.560 
is really putting material into your
greenhouse<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.460> really<00:01:11.460> 40<00:01:11.850> 50<00:01:12.180> gallon

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
greenhouse like a really 40 50 gallon

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 
greenhouse like a really 40 50 gallon
container<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> water<00:01:13.610> stones<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:15.060> earth<00:01:15.299> or

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
container of water stones or earth or

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
container of water stones or earth or
something<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.799> absorb<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> heat<00:01:17.670> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
something that will absorb the heat that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
something that will absorb the heat that
comes<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.299> during<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> day<00:01:18.900> naturally<00:01:19.590> into<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
comes in during a day naturally into the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.649 
comes in during a day naturally into the
greenhouse<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> Sun<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> also<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
greenhouse from the Sun and also the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.109 
greenhouse from the Sun and also the
heat<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> may<00:01:22.140> come<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:23.009> solar<00:01:23.880> can

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
heat that may come out of a solar can

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.840 
heat that may come out of a solar can
heater<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.810> those<00:01:25.670> objects<00:01:26.670> have

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
heater like this those objects have

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
heater like this those objects have
thermal<00:01:27.270> mass<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.780> hold<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> heat<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.650> then

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
thermal mass they hold the heat and then

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
thermal mass they hold the heat and then
they<00:01:28.860> radiate<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.790> heat<00:01:29.820> back<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
they radiate the heat back into the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.719 
they radiate the heat back into the
greenhouse<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.619> night<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.220> without<00:01:32.490> having

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
greenhouse at night so without having

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
greenhouse at night so without having
enough<00:01:33.240> thermal<00:01:33.630> mass<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.350> greenhouse

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
enough thermal mass in your greenhouse

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.359 
enough thermal mass in your greenhouse
you're<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.540> able<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.369> use

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you're just not going to be able to use

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.859 
you're just not going to be able to use
the<00:01:38.610> heat<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:38.939> generated<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.570> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the heat that's generated from this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.920 
the heat that's generated from this
during<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> day<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> evening<00:01:42.720> for

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
during the day for for the evening for

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
during the day for for the evening for
the<00:01:42.960> nights<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.189> other<00:01:44.340> question<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.270> was

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the nights the other question that I was

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.899 
the nights the other question that I was
asked<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.840> how<00:01:46.250> much<00:01:47.250> heat<00:01:47.520> comes<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
asked was how much heat comes out of the

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.249 
asked was how much heat comes out of the
thermal<00:01:50.909> solar<00:01:51.299> heaters<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
thermal solar heaters and this is a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.039 
thermal solar heaters and this is a
small<00:01:52.890> scale<00:01:53.280> size<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.030> them<00:01:54.180> hold<00:01:54.720> two

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
small scale size some of them hold two

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709 
small scale size some of them hold two
or<00:01:55.200> three<00:01:55.409> hundred<00:01:55.530> cans<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.570> really<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
or three hundred cans and really to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
or three hundred cans and really to
answer<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.619> got<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.040> 180

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
answer that it just got up to 180

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.709 
answer that it just got up to 180
degrees<00:01:59.939> really<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.930> answer<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> question

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
degrees really to answer the question

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.450 
degrees really to answer the question
you<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> get<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> formula<00:02:05.189> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you have to get a formula that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.910 
you have to get a formula that
calculates<00:02:05.670> here's<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> solar<00:02:06.960> fan<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
calculates here's a solar fan that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.330 
calculates here's a solar fan that
basically<00:02:08.429> calculates<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.800> amount<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.160> heat

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
basically calculates the amount of heat

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
basically calculates the amount of heat
that's<00:02:11.520> coming<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.540> amount<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.959> air

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that's coming out the amount of air

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
that's coming out the amount of air
that<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> fan<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.579> move<00:02:14.819> into<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.329> greenhouse

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that a fan can move into the greenhouse

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.729 
that a fan can move into the greenhouse
and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.109> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.439> kind<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.739> figure<00:02:16.950> out<00:02:18.739> how

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
and then you can kind of figure out how

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.530 
and then you can kind of figure out how
much<00:02:19.920> heat<00:02:20.189> is<00:02:20.310> really<00:02:20.489> flowing<00:02:21.180> into<00:02:21.329> there

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
much heat is really flowing into there

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.119 
much heat is really flowing into there
and<00:02:21.629> that's<00:02:21.780> kind<00:02:22.049> of<00:02:22.109> complicated<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.950> don't

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
and that's kind of complicated I don't

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.289 
and that's kind of complicated I don't
know<00:02:23.189> how<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.640> I'm<00:02:23.730> not<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.269> it

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
know how to do it I'm not going to do it

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.490 
know how to do it I'm not going to do it
but<00:02:25.019> what<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.409> would<00:02:25.590> need<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.400> really

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
but what you would need to do is really

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000 
but what you would need to do is really
attach<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.680> fan<00:02:29.359> to<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.750> output<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.859> solar

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
attach a fan to the output of the solar

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.330 
attach a fan to the output of the solar
can<00:02:32.340> heater<00:02:32.609> this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.209> again<00:02:33.709> his<00:02:34.709> solar<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
can heater this is again his solar and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.970 
can heater this is again his solar and
all<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.389> hook<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.079> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
all you do is you hook it up so that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.690 
all you do is you hook it up so that
it's<00:02:38.519> either<00:02:38.969> if<00:02:39.329> it's<00:02:39.510> electric<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.579> no

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
it's either if it's electric you have no

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.309 
it's either if it's electric you have no
worries<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.540> solar<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.930> got<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.230> make

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
worries if it's solar you got to make

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.410 
worries if it's solar you got to make
sure<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.620> solar<00:02:43.829> cells<00:02:44.129> are<00:02:44.340> facing<00:02:45.150> forward

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
sure the solar cells are facing forward

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.509 
sure the solar cells are facing forward
I'm<00:02:45.599> going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> take<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.139> apart<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.769> create

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
I'm going to take this apart and create

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.970 
I'm going to take this apart and create
a<00:02:47.579> fan<00:02:47.879> that<00:02:48.299> basically<00:02:48.810> will<00:02:49.349> sit<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.739> front

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
a fan that basically will sit in front

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.390 
a fan that basically will sit in front
of<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.400> draw<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.989> hot<00:02:52.230> air<00:02:52.470> into<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
of this and draw the hot air into the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.710 
of this and draw the hot air into the
greenhouse<00:02:53.669> at<00:02:54.060> some<00:02:54.299> point<00:02:55.669> now<00:02:56.720> other

applications<00:02:58.560> was<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.950> final<00:02:59.250> question<00:02:59.519> I

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
applications was the final question I

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.309 
applications was the final question I
was<00:02:59.669> asked<00:02:59.909> if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.659> build<00:03:00.930> something<00:03:01.169> like

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
was asked if you build something like

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.929 
was asked if you build something like
this<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.799> has<00:03:01.919> two<00:03:02.129> or<00:03:02.280> three<00:03:02.310> hundred<00:03:02.549> cans

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
this it has two or three hundred cans

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.390 
this it has two or three hundred cans
you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.689> heat<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:03.930> garage<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.159> put

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you can heat your garage you can put

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000 
you can heat your garage you can put
something<00:03:06.060> like<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.389> in<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:07.019> windowsill<00:03:07.799> and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
something like this in a windowsill and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.879 
something like this in a windowsill and
just<00:03:08.760> pull<00:03:09.000> heat<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.419> to<00:03:09.840> either<00:03:10.139> garage<00:03:10.560> or<00:03:10.859> a
