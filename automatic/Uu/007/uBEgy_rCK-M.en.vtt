00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.570
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.340
 teach how to make this lollipop 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.490
 with hama bits 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.170
 which as you see is very cool and is very 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.870
 easy to make 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.210
 and now I'm going to do it in pink 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.700
 but you can do it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 of the color that you want for it I am going to 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:34.310
 never use pink eyesight and if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.310
 he leaves yellow in white 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.060
 I will also use these tweezers 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.230
 plastic 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.770
 yes this plate that is square and is 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.770
 little 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.440
 let's start by placing the maids 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.699
 White color 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:04.149
 we are going to place it vertically in 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.149
 the center line and we're going to place 7 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.479
 one 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.360
 two 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.130
 4 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.149
 5 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.229
 and 7 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.860
 is going to stay like that 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:48.149
 now as you see in this heart we are going to 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.149
 put a pink ball on top 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.920
 A) Yes 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.310
 now let's put a row of 3 on top 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.880
 one 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880
 two 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:08.040
 and 3 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.040
 over let's put a row of 5 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.180
 3 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.040
 and I feel 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.959
 and above we are going to put a blow 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.959
 over let's put one of 7 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.069
 4 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.420
 and 7 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.620
 and on top we're going to put one of 9 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.660
 one 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.200
 two 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.200
 3 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.200
 4 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.290
 I have dropped seven 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.290
 8 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 in 9 as you see it is forming a triangle 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.770
 Now let's make another row of 9 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.770
 same as the previous 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.120
 one 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
 2. 3 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.870
 4 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 56 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.060
 and 9 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.690
 now let's make another row like that but 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.030
 leaving a gap in the middle 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.650
 A) Yes 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.650
 4 on each side 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:21.640
 4 to the right we leave a gap and 4 to the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.640
 left 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.920
 3 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.420
 and 4 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.680
 now let's do 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.680
 a row of 2 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:46.820
 up so in between 1 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.430
 and the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.300
 leaving an egg to the right and another to 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.300
 the left 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.330
 and on the left we're going to do what 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:04.759
 same we are going to place two air leaving 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.759
 one hole to the left and another to the right 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:15.859
 then it would be a vertical row from 7 am 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:22.819
 to vis white then a rose then another 

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:25.299
 of 3 another of 5 one of 7 2 of 9 one of 4 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:28.549
 on the right another 4 on the left 

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:31.059
 one of 2 on the right and one of 2 on the 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:31.059
 left 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:43.090
 and we would have our finished lollipop 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.090
 it would be like this now let's iron the 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.930
 once we have finished we are going to 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.710
 ironing for it we will need 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.870
 oven paper 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.230
 and an iron 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.470
 let's put the paper on with 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.200
 watch out 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.600
 and we are going to put the iron on it 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.600
 hot over for 5 seconds 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.430
 12 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.509
 4 and 5 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.360
 we raise and see if they are sticking 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.520
 to the paper when they are glued to the paper 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.889
 means that we have already finished by 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.889
 this side I'm going to give you a little more 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.750
 I think that they are all well 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.330
 stuck if you want to be more agitated the 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.370
 you only have to leave the 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.880
 iron more time 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.840
 when the paper is already cold 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.840
 we will raise 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:54.860
 so we'll turn it around and let's put 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.860
 a foil on top of baking paper 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.940
 and we're going to pass the iron another 5 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.820
 seconds 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:07.650
 1 2 3 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.650
 4 and 5 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:14.310
 I think it 's finished 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.790
 and we will have our lollipop for 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.370
 put the key ring or the necklace or as 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.919
 we want I hope you liked it and 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.160
