00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.450 
phone which is actually an easy mistake
to<00:00:11.370> make<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.940> I've<00:00:12.059> even<00:00:12.269> made<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.690> myself<00:00:13.460> to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
to make and I've even made it myself to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.400 
to make and I've even made it myself to
show<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.210> I've<00:00:15.420> got<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> work<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
show you this I've got to work with a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
show you this I've got to work with a
fairly<00:00:16.920> heavy<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.550> thick<00:00:17.970> batch<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
fairly heavy very thick batch of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.330 
fairly heavy very thick batch of
materials<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:18.930> we've<00:00:19.080> got<00:00:19.260> some<00:00:19.500> naugahyde

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
materials so we've got some naugahyde

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.790 
materials so we've got some naugahyde
Universal<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.480> I've<00:00:22.020> got<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.320> folded<00:00:22.529> in

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
Universal here and I've got it folded in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.820 
Universal here and I've got it folded in
half<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:23.670> I'm<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> fold<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.830> again

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
half and then I'm going to fold it again

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
half and then I'm going to fold it again
and<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:27.599> even<00:00:27.810> fold<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:29.660> one<00:00:30.660> more<00:00:30.960> time<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and let's even fold it one more time so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
and let's even fold it one more time so
that<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.899> well<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:34.050> quite

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that we're going from well that's quite

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500 
that we're going from well that's quite
a<00:00:34.290> bunch<00:00:34.559> we're<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.399> from<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.480> eight

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
a bunch we're going from two to eight

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
a bunch we're going from two to eight
layers<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.920> quite<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
layers and that's going to be quite a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
layers and that's going to be quite a
hill<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.090> jump<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.540> we're<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.989> able

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
hill to jump but we're going to be able

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.560 
hill to jump but we're going to be able
to<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> here

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
to do it here

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
to do it here
let's<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.780> ahead<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.320> set<00:00:44.100> our<00:00:44.129> machine<00:00:44.640> for

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
let's go ahead and set our machine for

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.950 
let's go ahead and set our machine for
straight<00:00:45.090> stitch<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:45.870> we

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
straight stitch on this because we

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.569 
straight stitch on this because we
haven't<00:00:46.350> done<00:00:46.440> much<00:00:46.500> straight<00:00:47.010> stitching<00:00:48.170> and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
haven't done much straight stitching and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.950 
haven't done much straight stitching and
what<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> show<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> first<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.719> that

what I want to show you first is that
that<00:00:52.199> walking<00:00:53.129> foot<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> real<00:00:54.059> champ<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that walking foot is a real champ and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
that walking foot is a real champ and
this<00:00:55.500> machine<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> extremely<00:00:56.730> powerful<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.870> we

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this machine is extremely powerful so we

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.930 
this machine is extremely powerful so we
are<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.190> put<00:00:59.309> our<00:00:59.430> tension<00:00:59.789> knob

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
are now in let's put our tension knob

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
are now in let's put our tension knob
back<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.010> so

back on to need to see that right now so
we're<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.080> layers<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
we're now going from two layers and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
we're now going from two layers and
jumping<00:01:05.820> nicely<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:07.200> eight<00:01:07.409> layers<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
jumping nicely up into eight layers of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.710 
jumping nicely up into eight layers of
material<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> show<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.220> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
how you can make a mistake I'm in such a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.289 
how you can make a mistake I'm in such a
thick<00:01:18.990> batch<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.500> material<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.250> forgot<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> drop

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
thick batch of material I forgot to drop

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.920 
thick batch of material I forgot to drop
my<00:01:21.479> presser<00:01:21.869> foot<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.009> happened<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.930> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
my presser foot so what happened was and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
my presser foot so what happened was and
I<00:01:25.049> actually<00:01:25.409> honestly<00:01:25.950> should<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> drop

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
I actually honestly should have to drop

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.469 
I actually honestly should have to drop
the<00:01:26.970> presser<00:01:27.210> foot<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.159> Machine<00:01:29.549> couldn't

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the presser foot if the Machine couldn't

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050 
the presser foot if the Machine couldn't
create<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> proper<00:01:31.680> stitch<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
create a proper stitch because the the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
create a proper stitch because the the
foot<00:01:33.299> wasn't<00:01:33.689> holding<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.140> material<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.770> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
foot wasn't holding the material down so

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
foot wasn't holding the material down so
I<00:01:35.040> end<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.700> big<00:01:35.909> rat's<00:01:36.240> nest<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I end up with this big rat's nest on the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260 
I end up with this big rat's nest on the
underside<00:01:37.470> eventually<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> rat's<00:01:38.759> nest<00:01:38.939> gets

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
underside eventually the rat's nest gets

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
underside eventually the rat's nest gets
caught<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> lower<00:01:40.200> mechanism<00:01:40.860> then

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
caught up in the lower mechanism then

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
caught up in the lower mechanism then
you<00:01:41.100> hear<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> crunch<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> needle

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you hear a crunch because the needle

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.810 
you hear a crunch because the needle
comes<00:01:42.509> down<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> hits<00:01:43.049> something<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.710> big<00:01:44.610> no

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
comes down and hits something so big no

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
comes down and hits something so big no
no<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.149> don't<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.259> what

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
no you don't want to do that so what

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
no you don't want to do that so what
we're<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.430> we're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.800 
we're going to do here is we're going to
cut<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> threads<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.329> actually

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
cut the threads and now I have actually

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
cut the threads and now I have actually
even<00:01:52.170> taken<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.649> point<00:01:52.979> off<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.399> needle<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
even taken the point off the needle so

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.249 
even taken the point off the needle so
this<00:01:54.119> would<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> case<00:01:54.750> where<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.049> would

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.950 
this would be a case where you would
want<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> change<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.130> needle<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.869> we're<00:01:57.869> just
