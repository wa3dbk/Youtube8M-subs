00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:15.790
 I wanted to talk to you on more on the topic 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:17.020
 rubber stock rubber motorcycle in the first 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.570
 two hundred fifty . 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.730
 or in Russia is called the hair of the guest 250 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.329
 rubber so I already showed 150. the back 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 wheel 60 to 17 front wheel with us 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:35.760
 going 110 at 6018 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.490
 quality rubber itself 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.890
 honestly very weak 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:47.040
 here it initially but it is, in principle, 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.240
 warm weather holds the road more or less 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.160
 here is a very beautiful tread like 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.200
 I why I left the stock nothing 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.670
 did not change 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.370
 tires here let's say for the Chinese 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.250
 mid-level technology what do I mean 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.890
 there are motorcycles up to one and a half thousand 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.590
 dollars worth of motorcycles scooters and 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.950
 so on there they are so cheap that 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.570
 tires put there initially generally 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.970
 plastic in the body I will write some recyclable 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.920
 did not know and so on when you touch 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.310
 the wheel you clearly understand that this is not 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.040
 rubber coarse plastics and she 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.400
 Naturally on asphalt very slips and 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.380
 very bad coupling with asphalt here 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.240
 tires somewhere I rate it as average 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.970
 class he has a cool tread all 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 beautiful so here I come across 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.070
 Christmas tree for the summer that is necessary but the quality 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.680
 rubber 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.799
 about mediocre I'm on chinese 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.500
 of course met the rubber and 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.010
 better quality 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.760
 Here I have a friend goes to the viper in 250 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.180
 m t here it tires worth more fun 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.690
 she is 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.600
 more quality more so soft 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.820
 well kept chain contact patch 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.830
 asphalt and so on and 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.600
 and and less and overflow less 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.530
 rearrange check and so on with me 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.940
 a little more 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.980
 but this does not mean that there is straight 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.790
 throwing out they just 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.950
 average level let's say grip with 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.480
 dear i'm already planning this season 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.730
 skate this on these wheels 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.100
 can now do especially nowhere and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 buying tires is too late for 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.940
 season next season I'll buy a cool 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.380
 rubber 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.840
 really cool what kind of helmet 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.750
 dunlop or something or pirelli not 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.550
 I know let's see and this is the season before cad it on 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.700
 This is why my estimate for stock 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.980
 rubber first two hundred fifty n. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:54.260
 This is 4 with a minus. So let's say 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 honestly soul 4 minus it it will 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.150
 honestly here is my opinion 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.260
