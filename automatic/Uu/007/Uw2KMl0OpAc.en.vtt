00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.259
 the body can not stand 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.249
 overloads first under the keyboard a 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.860
 then a communist after seven children think

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.489
 it seems to only be pilots on 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.629
 aerobatics but they have there 

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.379
 overload summer injured she is 

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:20.740
 beautiful body minute 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.190
 this roller coaster says 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.950
 the inventor is not perfect here 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.300
 if the centrifuge 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.310
 I learned how to feel 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.319
 roll to death 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.119
 Lithuanian designers 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.940
 In fact, he especially nasa called peak 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.479
 humanism he offers people 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:36.899
 Rosstat life in just 60 seconds 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.460
 This is the time of overload which are supposedly 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.679
 guarantees potential 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.239
 suicide 100% and 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.460
 creator’s death 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.309
 the design is suitable for both euthanasia 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.289
 and for the humane death penalty on 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.499
 first glance it is ordinary american 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.539
 roller coaster trolley in series 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.409
 passes 7 5 or due to the force of gravity 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.070
 she brings a human 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 the body until fatal overload 10 same 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.649
 it is two times more than legal 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.179
 attraction duration 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.949
 overload also matters on 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.640
 roller coaster just a few 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.990
 seconds starting families a minute 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.560
 ice chestnut dancing is designed and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.360
 man raises to the highest mountain 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.299
 go off at high speed going down 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.710
 down the meters 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.620
 he falls and lands and getting such 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.810
 an investment 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.600
 pieces of growth also falls they are all employees not 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.189
 remains as in the human brain British 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.180
 designer argue that the attraction of death 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.979
 allow suicide painlessly 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.469
 be in the next world 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.889
 for this, the feeling will first appear 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:32.349
 the euphoria will disappear 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.439
 peripheral vision and only after complete 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.560
 loss of consciousness comes death 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.590
 Doctors call this process cerebral 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 15 9 as a result of overloads can 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.390
 stop coming from the people 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.030
 for us it would be called stating that 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.370
 such an outcome is not only physically pleasant 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.650
 Putin's Russia is trying from the beginning 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.310
 man rises to a height and then 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.080
 a stone falls down 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 among Russians she left in the park 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.219
 entertainment his father worked there 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.239
 so I consider myself not only an engineer 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:59.989
 Lithuanian thoughts sign up for 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.429
 technical side of the issue statistics

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.249
 legal he launch such an attraction 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.999
 impossible that is the current law with 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.649
 no country have legislation 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.319
