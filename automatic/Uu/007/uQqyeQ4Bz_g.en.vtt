 he has here two screens two 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.050
 cells inside and the optics in the lenses 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 that allow you to pass the image of your 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 eyes is that if it were just the next screen 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.629
 You will not focus the image and you will be able to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.939
 even here we have adjustment is he is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.740
 fully adjustable lenses here you 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.720
 can adjust the positioning angle 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 so that everyone has a great vision 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.369
 position of your eyes and your vision 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.140

 people who have a bad vision use 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.229
 glasses can work well because 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 this is different from the obvious one is 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.090
 different in bié and so here is open 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 in software for example here we already 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.619

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.990

 computer with a gesture right I'm here 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.979
 in the demonstration that we had was a 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.780
 game where you are in a forest and you 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.149
 There are two balls in our boots. 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.450
 Ice and then you have to attack skulls 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.070

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 If it's a fire you play ball. 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.420
 ice and vice versa then there is a game 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.189
