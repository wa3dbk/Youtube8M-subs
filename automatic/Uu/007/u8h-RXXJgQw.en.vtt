stuff<00:00:40.710> people<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.219> struggling<00:00:41.520> with

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
stuff people are struggling with

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.100 
stuff people are struggling with
advanced<00:00:42.180> warfare<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
advanced warfare it's not like the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.450 
advanced warfare it's not like the
nuclear<00:00:43.469> metals<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.920> saw<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
nuclear metals that we saw a lot in the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
nuclear metals that we saw a lot in the
pre<00:00:44.670> build<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> game<00:00:45.180> completely<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.020> gun

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
pre build of game completely just gun

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
pre build of game completely just gun
skill<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.649> gun<00:00:46.860> streaks<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.789> really

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
skill and gun streaks so it's really

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
skill and gun streaks so it's really
really<00:00:48.239> hard<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> 30<00:00:49.110> kills<00:00:49.410> with

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
really hard to get it to 30 kills with

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
really hard to get it to 30 kills with
your<00:00:49.920> gun<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.300> gun<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
your gun and that's it just your gun so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
your gun and that's it just your gun so
it's<00:00:52.050> definitely<00:00:52.440> hard<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.890> Talia's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it's definitely hard to get Talia's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.160 
it's definitely hard to get Talia's
pumping<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:53.820> things<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> crazy<00:00:54.570> it's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
pumping these things out like crazy it's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
pumping these things out like crazy it's
just<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.620> amazing<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.280> he's<00:00:56.370> doing

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and as you can tell in this gameplay

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870 
and as you can tell in this gameplay
he's<00:01:03.510> using<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> ak-12<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> bout<00:01:05.010> 27<00:01:05.700> for

a lot of the gameplay I think he picks
up<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> ak-12<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.250> why<00:01:08.400> he's<00:01:08.520> using

whatever<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> next

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
whatever it is and then like the next

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.289 
whatever it is and then like the next
second<00:01:25.979> you're<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.369> wit<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
second you're like what wit what the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
second you're like what wit what the
guys<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> roof<00:01:28.380> far<00:01:28.680> away<00:01:28.920> now

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
guys over there on a roof far away now

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.170 
guys over there on a roof far away now
you're<00:01:29.340> trying<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> shoot<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.030> your

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you're trying to shoot them with your

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.210 
you're trying to shoot them with your
SMG<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> range<00:01:31.770> he

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
SMG you just don't have the range he

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
SMG you just don't have the range he
completely<00:01:32.640> melts<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.140> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
completely melts you so that's kind of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
completely melts you so that's kind of
like<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> what's<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.430> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like with the what's going on here in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.890 
like with the what's going on here in
the<00:01:35.579> game<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:36.240> theory<00:01:36.540> because

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the game that's just my theory because

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
the game that's just my theory because
the<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.560> SMGs<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.220> don't<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.490> enough

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the the SMGs just don't have enough

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
the the SMGs just don't have enough
range<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> ARS<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.689> obviously<00:01:40.079> reigning

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
range the ARS are obviously reigning

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
range the ARS are obviously reigning
supreme<00:01:40.680> that's<00:01:41.100> why<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> hear<00:01:41.400> people<00:01:41.579> all

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

slow<00:01:55.920> reload<00:01:56.280> time<00:01:56.520> those<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.149> two<00:01:57.299> big

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
slow reload time those are two big

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
slow reload time those are two big
factors<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.200> me<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.710> definitely<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
factors for me but it's definitely a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.709 
factors for me but it's definitely a
good<00:01:59.340> gun<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.790> get<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> lot<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.240> good<00:02:00.450> kills

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
good gun you can get a lot of good kills

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
good gun you can get a lot of good kills
with<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.110> obviously<00:02:01.590> tally<00:02:01.860> did<00:02:02.100> some<00:02:02.250> work<00:02:02.399> in

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
with it obviously tally did some work in

with it obviously tally did some work in
this<00:02:02.700> game<00:02:02.880> play<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
this game play with it and like I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.719 
this game play with it and like I
mentioned<00:02:04.409> before<00:02:04.649> he's<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> maps<00:02:05.340> solar

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
mentioned before he's on the maps solar

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.969 
mentioned before he's on the maps solar
pretty<00:02:06.329> fun<00:02:06.540> map<00:02:06.750> has<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> ton<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> verticality

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
pretty fun map has a ton of verticality

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.309 
pretty fun map has a ton of verticality
to<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> pretty<00:02:09.119> hard<00:02:09.450> map<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to it it's a pretty hard map you have to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
to it it's a pretty hard map you have to
be<00:02:10.440> careful<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.890> what's<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> rooftops

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
be careful of what's on the rooftops

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.670 
be careful of what's on the rooftops
because<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.870> there's<00:02:13.319> more

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
because it's not like there's more

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
because it's not like there's more
or<00:02:13.769> areas<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.340> verticality<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.120> map<00:02:15.299> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
or areas of verticality on this map I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
or areas of verticality on this map I
feel<00:02:15.629> like<00:02:15.689> the<00:02:15.840> areas<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.290> verticality<00:02:16.620> are

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
feel like the areas of verticality are

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.890 
feel like the areas of verticality are
higher<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.180> map<00:02:18.359> that's<00:02:18.569> what's<00:02:18.780> hard

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
higher on this map that's what's hard

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.119 
higher on this map that's what's hard
about<00:02:19.049> it<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.409> when<00:02:19.530> you're<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:19.769> below

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
about it because when you're down below

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.860 
about it because when you're down below
in<00:02:20.549> your<00:02:20.700> peripherals<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.329> can't<00:02:21.569> really<00:02:21.719> you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
in your peripherals you can't really you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.330 
in your peripherals you can't really you
have<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> hard<00:02:22.260> time<00:02:22.409> seeing<00:02:22.739> people<00:02:23.159> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
have a hard time seeing people and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.500 
have a hard time seeing people and
things<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.609> that<00:02:23.670> they're<00:02:23.969> way<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:24.299> high<00:02:24.480> up

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
things like that they're way way high up

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.910 
things like that they're way way high up
in<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:24.750> air<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.109> they<00:02:25.409> just<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.709> pick

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
in the air and they just kind of pick

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.319 
in the air and they just kind of pick
you<00:02:26.010> off<00:02:26.159> a<00:02:26.189> lot<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> snipers<00:02:26.909> on<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.180> map

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
you off a lot of snipers on this map

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.030 
you off a lot of snipers on this map
it's<00:02:27.569> really<00:02:27.750> popular<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.709> weird<00:02:28.920> because

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it's really popular it's weird because

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440 
it's really popular it's weird because
it's<00:02:29.219> a<00:02:29.310> small<00:02:29.609> map<00:02:29.879> but<00:02:30.090> there's<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.299> lot<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it's a small map but there's a lot of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.670 
it's a small map but there's a lot of
snipers<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.109> to<00:02:31.200> put<00:02:31.319> on<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.469> map<00:02:31.590> because

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
snipers like to put on the map because

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.050 
snipers like to put on the map because
of<00:02:31.859> all<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.099> rooftops<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.730> stuff<00:02:32.909> like<00:02:33.000> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of all the rooftops and stuff like that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.879 
of all the rooftops and stuff like that
but<00:02:33.389> a<00:02:33.599> fun<00:02:33.810> map<00:02:33.989> makes<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.319> guys<00:02:34.439> go<00:02:34.590> check<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
but a fun map makes you guys go check it

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.990 
the gun problems in this game the guns
are<00:03:58.470> obviously<00:03:58.859> not<00:03:58.949> balanced<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.909> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
are obviously not balanced like I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520 
are obviously not balanced like I
mentioned<00:04:00.060> before<00:04:00.449> the<00:04:00.780> ARS<00:04:01.139> or<00:04:01.259> reigning

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
very obvious the sniper rifles I've been

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.770 
very obvious the sniper rifles I've been
sniping<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.699> lot<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.970> sniper<00:04:06.180> reps<00:04:06.359> are<00:04:06.509> a<00:04:06.540> lot

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
sniping a lot the sniper reps are a lot

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.330 
sniping a lot the sniper reps are a lot
of<00:04:06.810> fun<00:04:07.019> obviously<00:04:07.620> they<00:04:07.889> they<00:04:08.040> they<00:04:08.069> said

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
of fun obviously they they they said

of fun obviously they they they said
that<00:04:08.430> quick<00:04:08.639> scoping<00:04:08.970> was<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.389> be<00:04:09.479> in

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
that quick scoping was going to be in

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.569 
that quick scoping was going to be in
the<00:04:09.599> game<00:04:09.750> well<00:04:10.109> obviously<00:04:10.470> quickscoping<00:04:11.340> in

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
the game well obviously quickscoping in

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.039 
the game well obviously quickscoping in
the<00:04:11.729> game<00:04:11.909> it's<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.180> little<00:04:12.389> bit<00:04:12.479> harder<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.840> do

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
the game it's a little bit harder to do

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.140 
the game it's a little bit harder to do
but<00:04:13.979> but<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.519> definitely<00:04:14.639> in<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.909> game<00:04:15.030> I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
but but it's definitely in the game I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.490 
but but it's definitely in the game I
having<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.389> lot<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.569> fun<00:04:15.659> with<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:15.930> they<00:04:16.169> do<00:04:16.229> take

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
having a lot of fun with it they do take

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.930 
having a lot of fun with it they do take
some<00:04:16.530> skills<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.099> a<00:04:17.130> little<00:04:17.310> bit<00:04:17.430> more<00:04:17.609> skill

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
some skills so a little bit more skill

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.159 
some skills so a little bit more skill
to<00:04:18.030> use<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.180> sniper<00:04:18.479> rifle<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:18.959> there<00:04:19.079> are<00:04:19.139> a

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
to use a sniper rifle but there are a

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.379 
to use a sniper rifle but there are a
lot<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.320> fun<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:20.549> can<00:04:20.579> definitely<00:04:21.090> hold

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
lot of fun and you can definitely hold

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.519 
lot of fun and you can definitely hold
your<00:04:21.599> own<00:04:21.659> with<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.870> sniper<00:04:22.049> rifles<00:04:22.440> but

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:22.529 
your own with the sniper rifles but

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.019 
your own with the sniper rifles but
obviously<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.039> AR<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> reigning<00:04:23.760> supreme

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:24.029 
obviously the AR is a reigning supreme

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.730 
obviously the AR is a reigning supreme
but<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:24.690> yeah<00:04:24.900> I've<00:04:25.020> been<00:04:25.139> disappointed<00:04:25.710> with

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
but so yeah I've been disappointed with

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.170 
but so yeah I've been disappointed with
the<00:04:25.860> score<00:04:26.130> streaks<00:04:26.400> because<00:04:26.700> they<00:04:26.820> just

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
the score streaks because they just

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.909 
the score streaks because they just
make<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.330> million<00:04:27.810> kills<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.289> get<00:04:28.470> can't

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
make a million kills to get can't

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.260 
make a million kills to get can't
remember<00:04:29.250> what<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:29.699> if<00:04:29.820> your<00:04:29.940> planet

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
remember what it is but if your planet

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.159 
remember what it is but if your planet
you<00:04:30.360> know<00:04:30.389> if<00:04:30.539> you're<00:04:30.660> playing<00:04:30.780> like<00:04:31.050> an

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
you know if you're playing like an

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.230 
you know if you're playing like an
objective<00:04:31.620> game<00:04:31.830> mode<00:04:32.009> like<00:04:32.160> domination<00:04:32.850> you

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
objective game mode like domination you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.999 
objective game mode like domination you
have<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.419> get<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.600> ton<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.020> kills<00:04:34.440> just<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.830> get

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
have to get a ton of kills just to get

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.439 
have to get a ton of kills just to get
something<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.580> UAV<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.030> think<00:04:36.240> it's<00:04:36.330> like

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
something like the UAV I think it's like

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.600 
something like the UAV I think it's like
12<00:04:36.810> kills<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.590> get<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> UAV<00:04:38.039> if<00:04:38.340> you're<00:04:38.460> not

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
12 kills to get a UAV if you're not

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.430 
12 kills to get a UAV if you're not
counting<00:04:39.090> any<00:04:39.419> captures<00:04:40.020> or<00:04:40.199> anything<00:04:40.410> like

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
counting any captures or anything like

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.320 
counting any captures or anything like
that<00:04:40.560> which<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.800> just<00:04:41.160> ridiculous<00:04:41.820> I<00:04:42.030> think

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
that which is just ridiculous I think

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.060 
that which is just ridiculous I think
they<00:04:42.389> need<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.570> up<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.810> up<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.680> points<00:04:43.979> you

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
they need to up that up the points you

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.800 
they need to up that up the points you
get<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.250> little<00:04:44.430> bit<00:04:44.610> for<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.210> kills<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.690> get

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
get a little bit for the kills you get

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.270 
get a little bit for the kills you get
on<00:04:45.930> objective<00:04:46.380> game<00:04:46.530> modes<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.889> also<00:04:47.130> this

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
on objective game modes and also this

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.950 
on objective game modes and also this
kind<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.460> stuff<00:04:47.669> but<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.270> maps<00:04:48.449> have<00:04:48.630> been<00:04:48.750> fun

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
kind of stuff but the maps have been fun

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.409 
kind of stuff but the maps have been fun
got<00:04:49.740> some<00:04:49.889> DLCs<00:04:50.340> coming<00:04:50.729> up<00:04:50.820> very<00:04:51.000> very<00:04:51.060> soon<00:04:51.300> I

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
got some DLCs coming up very very soon I

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.430 
got some DLCs coming up very very soon I
think<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.630> first<00:04:51.750> ones<00:04:51.990> coming<00:04:52.229> up<00:04:52.320> in

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
think the first ones coming up in

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.080 
think the first ones coming up in
January<00:04:52.949> we're<00:04:53.340> probably<00:04:53.580> going<00:04:53.759> to<00:04:53.850> get<00:04:53.910> some
