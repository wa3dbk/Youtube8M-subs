00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
there are certain stereotypes for a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
there are certain stereotypes for a
reason<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:38.280> for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
reason but I think to them I think for

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
reason but I think to them I think for
the<00:01:38.790> majority<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.049> trying<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> say

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the majority is what I'm trying to say

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
the majority is what I'm trying to say
with<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.759> o'clock<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.210> morning<00:01:42.540> about

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
with my one o'clock in the morning about

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.100 
with my one o'clock in the morning about
um<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:45.170> um<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:47.360> think<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.720> stereotypes

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
um is that um I think all stereotypes

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.969 
um is that um I think all stereotypes
are<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.710> weird<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.229> mean<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.380> sort<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
are kind of weird I mean I sort of I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.999 
are kind of weird I mean I sort of I
guess<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.640> sorta<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.270> why<00:01:54.390> people<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
guess I sorta get why people it's the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.940 
guess I sorta get why people it's the
way<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.219> categorize<00:01:56.549> people<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> think

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
way to categorize people but I think

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.420 
way to categorize people but I think
that<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.759> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.299> super<00:02:00.930> rude<00:02:01.430> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that it's like kind of super rude to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
that it's like kind of super rude to
these<00:02:02.520> stuff<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
these stuff like that I think when you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.130 
these stuff like that I think when you
stereotype<00:02:04.740> any<00:02:05.100> sort<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> orientation<00:02:06.869> or

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
stereotype any sort of orientation or

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.889 
stereotype any sort of orientation or
gender<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.530> race<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.099> class<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:09.569> kind<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
gender or race or class you're kind of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.130 
gender or race or class you're kind of
just<00:02:09.959> you're<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.770> being<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> little<00:02:11.400> bit<00:02:11.640> rude
