 Yes, that is right 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
 Denis Matsuev was the first 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.079
 what people 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.560
 but look what a dangerous moment 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 if at the far post Dmitry 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.609
 Komarovsky insurance premiums are not 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.990
 will come 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.550
 and began to add time Alexander 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 having exactly 45 of them so valuable in the first 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 time in minutes 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.330
 activate it all 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
 afloat budarin 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 technical issues 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.499
 such a difference given 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.319
 new building 1 tried to do it 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:56.990
 really 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.220
 as told that provoked have 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.340
 which was not 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.480
 kissed like a year in the development process 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.470
 teams 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.530
 not yet evening 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.520
 after the summer sun 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.070
 but right to call a good moment to 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 open an account 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.050
 Nigerian 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.050
 loans 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.640
 if I could say that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.700
 like a magnet draws pain 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.300
 there were no clear moments 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.490
 so I think that the other team is all 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.670
 did more of it acquired by the fact that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.300
 matter look dangerous moments 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.250
 which 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.930
 all the same were in this match 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.160
 here at the gate 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.870
 tastes confidently 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.240
 collided at the exit 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.620
 stereotypical 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.730
 it is already a year 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.850
 the same blow to the near corner of mosquitoes 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 how much the launch managed to twine to pull the ball 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.670
 of the neighbor shook this most dangerous moment 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.450
 at the gate 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.680
 it's a shot on goal 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.170
 Yury Tsygalko when the ball hit someone from 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.240
 defenders 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 goes on in both 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.269

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.889
 Bryansk dynamo still thus became 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.199
 eleven 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.859
 this is already attacking gomel 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.839
 here's a legionary 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.109
 why would you want to cross it 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.279
 easy to mine 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.349
 in Kursk seized the ball 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.329

 against Yanushkevich want 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.059
