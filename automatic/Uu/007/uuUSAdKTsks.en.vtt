00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.160
 hi to all this christ crisis hours 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 rap 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.429
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.619
 new video liquid test of the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 brand delight a liquid that has been 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 sent free by someone from 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.920
 forum e-cigarettes points like that I 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.970
 will test today 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.710
 so I have not plugged in too much on the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 bottle because they changed their 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 presentation recently I do not know 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670
 since when exactly but they have 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.670
 exchange 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:48.629
 so this is this from the cola of daily this 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.660
 small mail areas and so bah the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.420
 bottle there is everything there is always 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 clearly the pictogram for the visually impaired 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 ingredients so it's 80 20 years pay 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 gvg what's more common like 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 I told you before, these are the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 little pictos they did well 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.299
 to make a French liquid in France 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 again 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.580
 yeah we try I try them 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 French already we will see after the press 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.979
 so it's 12 mg of nicotine 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.509
 so what he was going to be good I do not 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.150
 do not know if they still do it now 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.329
 but but in fact there is a system of 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.590
 if not in here if we see in it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.030
 there is a color scheme for them 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.159
 plugs so if it's a white plug 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 it's without left nicotine have paid 6 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:45.450
 blue cap like me it's 12 mg and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:49.380
 orange is 18 mg and here I am so we 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.570
 will taste that with always my little gonna 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.450
 name three that I do not swim anymore in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.969
 version of 350 and in the protect us 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.969
 protect it versions one is gone 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:28.530
 a little abnormal for him 80 ok it 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.680
 has been aggressive enough it's on the way 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.540
 throat but it takes well to a little 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:46.410
 top of the water on the loose a jewel 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:59.850
 toulouse while at 120 or coca 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:03:02.330
 actually a coke finally not the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.760
 drink what clearly no drink 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:16.700
 more candy it had a lot of sugars 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:16.700
 kill but it's not it's not sweet it's 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:39.150
 wes and tart that's enough 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:52.680
 chemicals like you i would say it's not 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:57.540
 awesome it's not yeah huh good ah 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.950
 chocolate not sweet tart the taste of 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.800
 Coke, frankly, what are we looking for? 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.750
 will seek it's there but 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:13.030
 it's not that it's not that so my friend 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 like the other little things 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.989
 so I read a little problem with 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.299
 my proton so I do not know if you 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.130
 will have it at May 6 but I found 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.910
 what did it come in fact I had a taste 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.850
 of metal in front so I did not understand 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.230
 too much I really had a taste 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.930
 metal beggars when I called myself 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.940
 so I tried a back home as a 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.250
 little rumors tell him to remove 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.840
 the two little wicks that makes too much 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.940
 on the resistances 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.130
 I always had this taste of method I 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.720
 clean them thoroughly I did everything 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.810
 that I could always have that taste of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.790
 metal and dismounting the little 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.040
 resistance then the series 9 I do not know 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:59.220
 if this is the case also in fact 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.610
 disassembling the resistance there like this 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.610
 six long months 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.590
 you see it the turns of the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.690
 resistance and the machine has whitened that 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.710
 stuck almost the metal part 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.900
 resistance on the edges so 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.780
 I clogged up would end up center is a 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.260
 little my resistance is magic 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.870
 plus a drop of more metal taste and 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.669
 this is perfect so the next top 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.860
 now 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.669
 so that's fine if it helps you if you 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.280
 have a taste of metal 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.500
 look at any resistance 6 to 6.7 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.030
 worse casillas that touch that affect 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.340
 pretty much your edge or that's pretty 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.960
 we're going to train a little bit 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.880
 take a quick tour of the lists of 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.690
 accuracy or what you have under the 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.530
 hand to his ends you do that and you 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.540
 will see the metal vanish it's magic 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.540
 suddenly the too much as top 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.870
 and that's it for today 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.580
 it was a small enough short video 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.800
 but hey I wanted to do it especially 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.560
 not for the liquid because you know 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.760
 understood it will not be my thing but 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.350
 especially for the little resistance there 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.500
 because it was unpleasant anyway 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.390
 second metal 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.630
 so I hope it can help you 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.390
 at home as usual will try it so 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.470
 my comment I'm happy there is 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.750
 a few it always makes me 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.150
 pleasure whether they are good or bad 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.090
 anyway all advised good to take 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.720
 and then that will allow me the best 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:34.280
 improve it better but video if 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.910
 you need it and then subscribe 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.500
 if that tempts you and pia on this good 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.500
 day and had me well
