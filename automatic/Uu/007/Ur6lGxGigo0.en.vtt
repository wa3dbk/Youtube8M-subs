of the the fighting on track i think the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.169 
of the the fighting on track i think the
tensions<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.069> because<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.579> regulations

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
tensions is because the regulations

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.529 
tensions is because the regulations
