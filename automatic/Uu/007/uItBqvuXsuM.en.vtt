that<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:47.230> looked<00:00:47.469> like<00:00:47.649> kicker<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.129> punter

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
that it looked like kicker and punter

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.430 
that it looked like kicker and punter
will<00:00:48.489> be<00:00:48.610> in<00:00:48.879> one<00:00:49.149> set<00:00:49.480> together<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.320> guys

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
will be in one set together and you guys

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.100 
will be in one set together and you guys
were<00:00:50.649> one<00:00:50.980> hundred<00:00:51.190> percent<00:00:51.399> right<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.329> that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
were one hundred percent right and that

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.810 
were one hundred percent right and that
guess<00:00:53.410> was<00:00:53.620> amazing<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.250> kicker<00:00:54.609> and<00:00:54.789> punter

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
guess was amazing and kicker and punter

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.479 
guess was amazing and kicker and punter
are<00:00:55.120> in<00:00:55.239> one<00:00:55.420> set<00:00:55.719> but<00:00:56.109> when<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.129> video

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
are in one set but when in that video

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.860 
are in one set but when in that video
I've<00:00:57.670> kind<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.000> question<00:00:58.300> how<00:00:58.510> will<00:00:58.570> they<00:00:58.809> do

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
I've kind of question how will they do

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.220 
I've kind of question how will they do
kicker<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.410> punter<00:00:59.489> because<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.930> regular

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
kicker and punter because the regular

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.529 
kicker and punter because the regular
sets<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.620> need<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.829> get<00:01:02.980> six<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.519> these<00:01:03.640> coins

sets you need to get six of these coins

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
and you have to get to elites that play

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.569 
and you have to get to elites that play
the<00:01:23.020> position<00:01:23.170> seven<00:01:23.799> goals<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.280> play<00:01:24.460> that

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
the position seven goals I play that

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.760 
the position seven goals I play that
position<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.970> one<00:01:25.180> silver<00:01:25.659> so<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.140> said<00:01:26.409> how<00:01:26.619> is

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
position in one silver so I said how is

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.380 
position in one silver so I said how is
that<00:01:26.860> can<00:01:27.040> be<00:01:27.159> possible<00:01:27.640> because<00:01:28.000> there's<00:01:28.240> not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
that can be possible because there's not

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.880 
that can be possible because there's not
that<00:01:28.450> many<00:01:28.780> elites<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.439> kicker<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:29.829> punter

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
that many elites for kicker and punter

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.100 
that many elites for kicker and punter
so<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.369> jack<00:01:30.909> up<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> price<00:01:31.390> like<00:01:31.630> crazy<00:01:31.869> for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
so that jack up the price like crazy for

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.380 
so that jack up the price like crazy for
those<00:01:32.259> two<00:01:32.409> players<00:01:33.009> but<00:01:33.670> they<00:01:34.060> kind<00:01:34.329> of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
those two players but they kind of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.539 
those two players but they kind of
changed<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.930> for<00:01:35.619> kicker<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.070> punter<00:01:36.100> you

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
changed it for kicker and punter you

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.249 
changed it for kicker and punter you
just<00:01:36.790> need<00:01:36.909> one<00:01:37.150> elite<00:01:37.420> punter<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.930> one<00:01:38.140> of

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
just need one elite punter and one of

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.940 
just need one elite punter and one of
the<00:01:38.350> kicker<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.979> 30<00:01:40.500> gold<00:01:41.500> punters<00:01:41.920> and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the kicker and 30 gold punters and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.700 
the kicker and 30 gold punters and
kickers<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.430> two<00:01:42.909> gold<00:01:43.329> silver<00:01:44.290> punter<00:01:44.619> and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
kickers and two gold silver punter and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.300 
kickers and two gold silver punter and
kickers<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.840> lot<00:01:47.020> that's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:48.130> tongue

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
kickers so that's a lot that's a tongue

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.280 
kickers so that's a lot that's a tongue
twister<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.850> guess<00:01:49.060> but<00:01:49.570> yeah<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.140> only

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
twister I guess but yeah so the only

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.740 
twister I guess but yeah so the only
there's<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.759> partner<00:01:52.210> that's<00:01:52.390> in<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.600> leap

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
there's one partner that's in the leap

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.149 
there's one partner that's in the leap
that's<00:01:53.049> Ryan<00:01:53.380> Allen<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:53.979> see<00:01:54.130> right

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
that's Ryan Allen you can see right

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.149

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
do that for the position heroes my guess

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.159 
do that for the position heroes my guess
for<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:11.169> quarterback<00:05:12.169> position<00:05:12.400> will<00:05:13.400> be

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
for the quarterback position will be

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.950 
for the quarterback position will be
pain<00:05:15.169> Manning<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.919> will<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.960> positional

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
pain Manning that will be the positional

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.409 
pain Manning that will be the positional
hero<00:05:18.169> if<00:05:18.470> that's<00:05:18.770> my<00:05:19.010> guess<00:05:19.070> because<00:05:19.910> he<00:05:20.210> does

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
hero if that's my guess because he does

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.570 
hero if that's my guess because he does
not<00:05:20.450> have<00:05:20.780> any<00:05:21.020> cards<00:05:21.380> basically<00:05:21.979> in<00:05:22.130> Madden

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
one and then the role to the ring so

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.260 
one and then the role to the ring so
paying<00:05:30.199> Manning<00:05:30.590> that<00:05:31.190> name<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:31.760> not<00:05:31.970> having

paying Manning that name and not having
any<00:05:32.600> cards<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.610> really<00:05:34.610> mind-blowing<00:05:35.389> so<00:05:35.720> I

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
any cards is really mind-blowing so I
