00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 because he doesn't look good and he was good sharm el sheik egitto 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.460

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.289
 but what on TV our opponent our arsenal is called card 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.880
 let's play with the catania 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 and therefore 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.990
 given answer that consequence because brown 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.140

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.360

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.520
 all high school classic and then 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.050
 if it's up to them though 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.590
 okay because 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.640
 demonstration we have already said 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.600
 customer 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.030
 mo tomorrow 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 a very important match, the most important one 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.950
 of the year 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.780
 the solar one 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.850
 is what we have to play what we have to unite 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.620
 and we must have those attentions 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.800
 without then going to arrive care 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.860
 situations that are under everyone's eyes www.italiauno facebook 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.060
 but Catania vanasco reasons well to football and especially at home 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.320
 I did his 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.600
 beautiful ranking in peschiera 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.100
 own. - of us for which 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.259
 this difficult game then it is true 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.600
 they have an audience 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.760
 particularly warm 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.000
 affectionate towards the team 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.860
 particularly close 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.820
 Last year's close treat looked like 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.220
 that they played 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 that already if even the Greek 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.110
 % 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.240
 what was there 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 absolutely go if there 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.470
 we must continue to make the results to go back to ours 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.160
 Ranking 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.780
 I still don't stick to those are the values â€‹â€‹of the team for which 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.560
 to succeed then come over that ground for if there is to do some good 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.019
 result 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.739
 in some difficult field like paper 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.869
 he asked me what year they are always the same 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.269
 beautiful and deep the beautiful crafty for which mcr if sometimes tdt sends a 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.269
 message and then gives you the rip-off because I think posed 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.490
 better better medial
