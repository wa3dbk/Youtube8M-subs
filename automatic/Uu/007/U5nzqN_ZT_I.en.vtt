training for SDM function wise SDM SDM
means<00:00:13.309> selectable<00:00:14.309> datum<00:00:15.269> position<00:00:15.990> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
means selectable datum position it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.950 
means selectable datum position it
allows<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.789> multiple<00:00:18.029> data<00:00:18.570> point

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
allows you to have multiple data point

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.290 
allows you to have multiple data point

absolute mode and when you use the SDM

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.970 
absolute mode and when you use the SDM
you<00:00:42.570> simply<00:00:43.280> press<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> SDM<00:00:44.910> button<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.980> now

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you simply press the SDM button and now

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.000 
you simply press the SDM button and now
you<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.219> selecting<00:00:47.930> different<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.620> point

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you are selecting different with point

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.970 
you are selecting different with point
of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.690> SDM<00:00:51.920> data<00:00:53.300> there<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> total<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.989> 300

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of the SDM data there are a total of 300

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000 
of the SDM data there are a total of 300
datum<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> choose<00:00:57.379> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.649> scroll

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
datum for you to choose you can scroll

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.630

arrow up key one two three so for

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.600 
arrow up key one two three so for
different<00:01:11.670> SDM<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.140> similar<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
different SDM they are similar to the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.810 
different SDM they are similar to the
idea<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> absolute<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.140> incrementer

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.780 

let's<00:01:20.820> say<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.710> few<00:01:23.159> position<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
let's say now we have a few position to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
let's say now we have a few position to
remember<00:01:25.250> let's<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> absolute

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
remember let's go to the absolute

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.039 
remember let's go to the absolute
mantras<00:01:28.490> okay<00:01:29.570> let's<00:01:30.570> say<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.530> B<00:01:32.250> position<00:01:33.049> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
mantras okay let's say the B position is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
mantras okay let's say the B position is
the<00:01:34.380> zero<00:01:34.890> point<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.970> absolute<00:01:36.570> mode<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.610> now

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the zero point in absolute mode so now

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
the zero point in absolute mode so now
we<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> absolute<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.290> set<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
we are in the absolute we have set this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.530 
we are in the absolute we have set this
to<00:01:40.890> zero<00:01:42.200> okay<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.100> multiple<00:01:44.909> datum

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
to zero okay and we have multiple datum

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.499 
to zero okay and we have multiple datum
that<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.840> need<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> remember<00:01:46.430> for<00:01:47.430> example<00:01:47.970> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that we need to remember for example on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:02:00.340 
that we need to remember for example on
the<00:01:49.049> dot<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> datum<00:01:50.670> one

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.810 

okay<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.600> erase<00:02:04.290> our

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
okay but we don't want to erase our

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.810 
okay but we don't want to erase our
absolute<00:02:05.820> position<00:02:06.330> data<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.280> order<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> do

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
absolute position data so in order to do

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.199 
absolute position data so in order to do
that<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.420> use<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.640> selected<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.790> datum

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
that we can use the selected or datum

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.610 
that we can use the selected or datum
use<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:16.100> number<00:02:17.100> one<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.080> also<00:02:19.230> get

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
use it in number one you can also get

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.070 
use it in number one you can also get
hourly<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:22.010> okay<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:24.060> I'll<00:02:24.390> set<00:02:24.840> this

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
hourly one okay and now I'll set this

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.550 
hourly one okay and now I'll set this
position<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:27.540> zero<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.360> my<00:02:30.690> second

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
position to zero so this is my second

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.560 
position to zero so this is my second
datum<00:02:32.130> which<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.590> SDM<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:35.390> let's<00:02:36.390> say<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
datum which is the SDM one let's say I

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.820 
datum which is the SDM one let's say I
have<00:02:36.840> another<00:02:37.080> datum<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.800> remember<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:40.110> this

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
have another datum to remember and this

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.460 
have another datum to remember and this
is<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.420> datum<00:02:42.420> point<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:44.459> save<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.320> SD<00:02:46.320> m

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
is the datum point I can save it to SD m

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.780 
is the datum point I can save it to SD m
number<00:02:46.709> three<00:02:47.160> for<00:02:47.790> example<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:50.370> set<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
number three for example I can set it to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.070 
number three for example I can set it to
zero<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:53.010> now<00:02:53.280> if<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.820> need<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.300> go<00:02:54.540> back<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.930> my

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
zero so now if I need to go back to my

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.600 
zero so now if I need to go back to my
absolute<00:02:55.489> datum<00:02:56.489> point<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.260> guess<00:02:58.260> set<00:02:58.680> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
absolute datum point I guess set to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.160 
absolute datum point I guess set to
absolute<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.670> return<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.510> zero

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
absolute and I return it to zero

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:18.820 
absolute and I return it to zero
position

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.320 

and<00:03:19.400> I'll<00:03:19.610> be<00:03:19.790> back<00:03:20.000> -<00:03:20.270> ah<00:03:20.350> my<00:03:21.350> little<00:03:22.340> zero<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
and I'll be back - ah my little zero the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.830 
and I'll be back - ah my little zero the
B<00:03:23.510> position<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.490> want<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.760> go<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.970> my<00:03:28.570> SDM<00:03:29.570> one

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
B position if I want to go to my SDM one

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:39.310 
B position if I want to go to my SDM one
okay<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.210> just<00:03:32.210> select<00:03:32.620> SDM<00:03:34.960> 1<00:03:36.430> enter<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:38.630> I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
okay I just select SDM 1 enter and I

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.510 
okay I just select SDM 1 enter and I
move<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.710> zero

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
move it to zero

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:51.480 
move it to zero
I'll<00:03:40.670> go<00:03:41.000> back<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.330> my<00:03:42.080> data<00:03:48.220> okay

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.250 

and<00:03:52.490> if<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.000> want<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.240> go<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.720> next<00:03:54.050> position

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
and if I want to go to the next position

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:09.300 
and if I want to go to the next position
I<00:03:54.770> can<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.420> go<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:58.090> number<00:03:59.090> three

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.550 

okay<00:04:12.360> another<00:04:13.360> way<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.690> use<00:04:14.170> this

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
okay another way to use this

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.420 
okay another way to use this
SDM<00:04:15.099> function<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:17.010> something<00:04:18.010> like<00:04:18.190> a

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
SDM function is something like a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.940 
SDM function is something like a
production<00:04:19.150> mode<00:04:19.359> where<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.530> have<00:04:20.739> like

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
production mode where you have like

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.950 
production mode where you have like
multiple<00:04:21.519> points<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.480> need<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.780> do

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
multiple points that you need to do

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.340 
multiple points that you need to do
drilling<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.700> program<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.330> into<00:04:25.690> a

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
drilling you can program it into a

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.170 
drilling you can program it into a
series<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:28.050> SDM<00:04:29.050> position<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.940> you'll<00:04:30.940> just

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
series of a SDM position and you'll just

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.530 
series of a SDM position and you'll just
move<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.660> from<00:04:32.110> zero<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.620> zero<00:04:33.120> let's<00:04:34.120> say<00:04:34.300> for

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
move it from zero to zero let's say for

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.890 
move it from zero to zero let's say for
example<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:35.169> need<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.770> drill<00:04:36.100> one<00:04:36.310> hole<00:04:36.370> here

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
example I need to drill one hole here

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.500 
example I need to drill one hole here
second<00:04:37.900> hole<00:04:38.080> here<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.500> hole<00:04:39.100> here<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
second hole here and hole here so the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.010 
second hole here and hole here so the
first<00:04:40.720> hole<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:40.990> my<00:04:41.590> absolute<00:04:42.100> zero<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.840> go

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
first hole is my absolute zero I just go

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.810 
first hole is my absolute zero I just go
back<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.260> my<00:04:44.500> absolute<00:04:44.950> zero<00:04:47.610> okay

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
back to my absolute zero okay

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.680 
back to my absolute zero okay
and<00:04:49.690> when<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.470> reaches<00:04:50.889> zero<00:04:50.919> I<00:04:51.430> do<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.850> drill

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
and when it reaches zero I do a drill

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.750 
and when it reaches zero I do a drill
hole<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.790> then<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:55.000> second<00:04:55.479> oh<00:04:56.310> I'll<00:04:57.310> go<00:04:57.700> to

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
hole and then the second oh I'll go to

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:11.159 
hole and then the second oh I'll go to
SDM<00:04:58.690> one<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:03.400> move<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.760> zero<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:10.169> I

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
SDM one and I move it to zero and I

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:21.090 
SDM one and I move it to zero and I
drill<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> hole<00:05:11.830> here<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:14.410> next<00:05:14.740> step<00:05:20.100> move

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
drill a hole here and the next step move

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:29.060 
drill a hole here and the next step move
to<00:05:21.340> zero<00:05:21.669> again

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.650 

and<00:05:29.700> I<00:05:30.000> drill<00:05:30.270> hole<00:05:30.780> they<00:05:31.380> will<00:05:31.620> make<00:05:31.830> the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
and I drill hole they will make the

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.900 
and I drill hole they will make the
procedure<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.080> production<00:05:34.560> faster<00:05:35.280> easier

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
procedure and a production faster easier

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:43.400 
procedure and a production faster easier
and<00:05:37.610> less<00:05:38.610> mistake<00:05:41.420> so<00:05:42.420> you<00:05:42.450> have<00:05:42.780> up<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.170> 300

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
and less mistake so you have up to 300

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.940 
and less mistake so you have up to 300
position<00:05:44.130> for<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.760> program<00:05:45.440> and<00:05:46.440> I<00:05:46.710> think

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
position for you to program and I think

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.210 
position for you to program and I think
it's<00:05:47.070> a<00:05:47.190> very<00:05:47.580> good<00:05:47.820> function<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.360> have<00:05:49.220> thank

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
it's a very good function to have thank

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.670 
it's a very good function to have thank
you<00:05:50.280> bye<00:05:50.640> bye
