the glass the easier will be to cut this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.990 
the glass the easier will be to cut this
is<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.050> guide<00:01:02.470> it's<00:01:02.980> adjustable<00:01:03.670> for<00:01:03.850> the

with<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.140> bottle<00:01:08.440> in<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:10.000> we're<00:01:10.390> going

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
with the bottle in and then we're going

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.210 
with the bottle in and then we're going
to<00:01:10.630> hold<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.230> with<00:01:11.350> our<00:01:11.500> left<00:01:11.680> hand<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.130> place

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
to hold it with our left hand and place

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.399 
to hold it with our left hand and place
squeezing<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:12.940> just<00:01:13.390> gently<00:01:13.720> against<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
squeezing it just gently against the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.740 
squeezing it just gently against the
score<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.520> then<00:01:15.700> with<00:01:15.820> our<00:01:15.850> right<00:01:16.210> hand<00:01:16.240> we'll

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
score and then with our right hand we'll

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.040 
score and then with our right hand we'll
twist<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.260> only<00:01:17.620> once<00:01:18.100> around<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:19.720> scoring

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
twist it only once around not scoring

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.360 
twist it only once around not scoring
too<00:01:20.229> deeply<00:01:21.840> guide<00:01:22.840> away<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.530> we<00:01:23.740> zoom<00:01:24.010> in<00:01:24.190> and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
too deeply guide away and we zoom in and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.700 
too deeply guide away and we zoom in and
you<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.490> see<00:01:24.940> just<00:01:25.180> faintly<00:01:25.570> there<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.350> line

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
you can see just faintly there that line

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.050 
you can see just faintly there that line
that's<00:01:26.890> been<00:01:27.070> scored<00:01:27.400> in<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.610> bottle<00:01:27.910> and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
that's been scored in the bottle and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.640 
that's been scored in the bottle and
that's<00:01:28.510> where<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:28.810> want<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.140> encourage<00:01:29.410> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
that's where we want to encourage the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.380 
that's where we want to encourage the
bottle<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.010> break<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.550> next<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.790> breaking

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
bottle to break and next is the breaking

bottle to break and next is the breaking
stage<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.570> kettle<00:01:41.020> of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
stage for this we have a kettle of

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.770 
stage for this we have a kettle of
boiling<00:01:41.410> water<00:01:41.730> container<00:01:42.730> of<00:01:42.940> cold<00:01:43.210> water

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.700 

and<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.930> sort<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.200> bucket<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.680> work<00:01:47.830> in<00:01:49.590> look<00:01:50.590> at

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
and a sort of bucket to work in look at

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.290 
and a sort of bucket to work in look at
the<00:01:50.770> bottle

the<00:01:53.760> hot<00:01:53.850> water<00:01:54.150> onto<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> line<00:01:54.900> as

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the hot water onto the line as

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.290 
the hot water onto the line as
accurately<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.710> possible<00:01:55.760> switched<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:56.940> cold

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
accurately as possible switched to cold

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.760 
accurately as possible switched to cold
and<00:01:57.720> then<00:01:58.680> back<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.160> hot<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.640> you'll<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
and then back to hot and you'll just

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
and then back to hot and you'll just
hear<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> break<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.910> it'll<00:02:03.150> come

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
hear it break like that and it'll come

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.860 
hear it break like that and it'll come
smoothly<00:02:03.840> apart<00:02:04.260> if<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:05.610> zoom<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.510> can<00:02:06.570> see

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
smoothly apart if we zoom in you can see

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.270 
smoothly apart if we zoom in you can see
that<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.440> wouldn't<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:07.770> drink<00:02:07.950> from<00:02:08.040> it<00:02:08.100> yet

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that you wouldn't to drink from it yet

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.770 
that you wouldn't to drink from it yet
but<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.880> at<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.150> jagged<00:02:09.480> it's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
but it's not at all jagged it's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.070 
but it's not at all jagged it's
relatively<00:02:10.680> smooth<00:02:10.980> there<00:02:11.220> our<00:02:12.210> final<00:02:12.870> stage

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
relatively smooth there our final stage

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.460 
relatively smooth there our final stage
is<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.710> smoothing<00:02:14.190> stage<00:02:18.110> here<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
is the smoothing stage here is the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.960 
is the smoothing stage here is the
bucket<00:02:19.770> again<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.280> time<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:20.700> full<00:02:20.880> of

water because if your same thing glass

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.950 
water because if your same thing glass
you<00:02:23.550> want<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.790> work<00:02:23.910> under<00:02:24.090> water<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.600> keep<00:02:24.720> the

you want to work under water to keep the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.390 
you want to work under water to keep the
dust<00:02:24.990> out<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> air<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.070> an<00:02:26.160> abrasive

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
dust out of the air we have an abrasive

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000 
dust out of the air we have an abrasive
pad<00:02:26.730> Emery<00:02:27.270> cloth<00:02:27.450> sandpaper<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.470> we'll<00:02:28.980> use

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
pad Emery cloth sandpaper and we'll use

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.980 
pad Emery cloth sandpaper and we'll use
those<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> smooth<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.730> edge<00:02:29.820> that's<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.870> end

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
those to smooth the edge that's the end

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.580 
those to smooth the edge that's the end
of<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> video<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.530> hope<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.890> enjoyed<00:02:32.130> thanks
