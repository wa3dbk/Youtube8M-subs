we've always had the top him as his aim

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.670 
we've always had the top him as his aim
in<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.660> spring<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.080> he's<00:02:16.200> had<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> couple<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
in the spring so he's had a couple of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.200 
in the spring so he's had a couple of
runs<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> new<00:02:17.580> breed<00:02:17.880> way<00:02:18.030> round

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.730 
runs and and a new breed way round
really<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:18.870> thought<00:02:19.500> she'd<00:02:19.710> just

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
really really well thought she'd just

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.440 
really really well thought she'd just
gone<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.190> handicapper<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.030> he's<00:02:21.120> no<00:02:21.270> rate

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
gone up the handicapper but he's no rate

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
gone up the handicapper but he's no rate
150<00:02:22.050> which<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.350> probably<00:02:22.650> career-high<00:02:23.130> but

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
150 which is probably career-high but

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.990 
150 which is probably career-high but
you<00:02:23.880> love<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> fences<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:26.000> November

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
I hope with a very good run again in the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:40.089 
I hope with a very good run again in the
top<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.180> rebel<00:02:30.600> rebellion

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.209 

this<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.579> park<00:02:42.079> he<00:02:43.079> had<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> nice<00:02:43.950> run<00:02:44.159> in

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
this is just a park he had a nice run in

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.649 
this is just a park he had a nice run in
the<00:02:44.370> RSA<00:02:44.879> recently<00:02:45.920> probably<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.159> old<00:02:47.340> track

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
the RSA recently probably the old track

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.580 
the RSA recently probably the old track
channel<00:02:48.659> was<00:02:48.750> probably<00:02:48.959> sharp<00:02:49.290> enough<00:02:49.530> for

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
channel was probably sharp enough for

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.559 
channel was probably sharp enough for
him<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:49.920> he<00:02:50.099> he<00:02:50.310> ran<00:02:50.489> with<00:02:50.609> credit<00:02:51.000> he's<00:02:51.390> gonna

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
him but he he ran with credit he's gonna

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.059 
him but he he ran with credit he's gonna
run<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> three<00:02:52.230> mile<00:02:52.409> novice<00:02:52.680> chase<00:02:52.890> at

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
run in the three mile novice chase at

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.009 
run in the three mile novice chase at
Aintree<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.579> think<00:02:53.939> a<00:02:54.000> flat<00:02:54.239> travel<00:02:54.659> suit<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
Aintree I think a flat travel suit and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.229 
Aintree I think a flat travel suit and
well<00:02:55.109> like<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.590> at<00:02:55.709> Newbury<00:02:56.239> he's

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
well like it was at Newbury he's

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.119 
well like it was at Newbury he's
progressing<00:02:57.629> nicely<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.439> seems<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:58.950> come<00:02:59.069> out

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
progressing nicely and seems to come out

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.589 
progressing nicely and seems to come out
a<00:02:59.189> Chapman<00:02:59.549> very<00:02:59.730> very<00:02:59.939> well<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
a Chapman very very well it's just a

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.349 
a Chapman very very well it's just a
party<00:03:01.019> how<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:01.920> said<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.250> blur<00:03:02.430> has<00:03:03.030> run

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
party how this is said to blur has run

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.879 
party how this is said to blur has run
some<00:03:03.510> really<00:03:03.750> good<00:03:03.870> races<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.409> season<00:03:04.469> he

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
some really good races this season he

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.539 
some really good races this season he
goes<00:03:05.069> well<00:03:05.280> fresh<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.769> we<00:03:07.769> decided<00:03:08.099> that<00:03:08.250> since

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
goes well fresh so we decided that since

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.099 
goes well fresh so we decided that since
his<00:03:08.849> last<00:03:08.970> run<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> challenge<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.720> aiming<00:03:10.019> for

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
his last run a challenge to aiming for

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.710 
his last run a challenge to aiming for
the<00:03:10.200> top<00:03:10.379> permit<00:03:10.709> entry<00:03:11.700> next<00:03:12.120> week<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.480> think

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the top permit entry next week I think

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.360 
the top permit entry next week I think
the<00:03:12.900> big<00:03:13.049> fences<00:03:13.439> in<00:03:13.560> two-mile<00:03:13.980> five<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.340> a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the big fences in two-mile five and a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.470 
the big fences in two-mile five and a
half<00:03:14.400> foot<00:03:14.609> longs<00:03:14.819> are<00:03:14.939> suiting<00:03:15.239> really

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
half foot longs are suiting really

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.839 
half foot longs are suiting really
really<00:03:15.720> well<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.109> he<00:03:16.889> worked<00:03:17.280> nicely<00:03:17.459> at<00:03:17.700> win

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
really well so he worked nicely at win

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.569 
really well so he worked nicely at win
canteen<00:03:18.239> yesterday<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:19.099> it's<00:03:20.099> been<00:03:20.310> his<00:03:20.430> aim

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
hurdle or we might wait for something a

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.100 
hurdle or we might wait for something a
bit<00:04:59.099> later<00:04:59.280> on<00:04:59.370> down<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.639> season<00:05:00.060> but<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.419> good

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
bit later on down the season but a good

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.510 
bit later on down the season but a good
season<00:05:01.349> he's<00:05:01.590> only<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.800> five<00:05:02.009> rod

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
season he's only a five rod

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.100 
season he's only a five rod
he's<00:05:02.880> one<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.090> her<00:05:03.240> fences<00:05:03.419> this<00:05:03.750> year<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.050> I

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
he's one of her fences this year and I

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.260 
he's one of her fences this year and I
think<00:05:04.169> it'd<00:05:04.919> be<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.250> big<00:05:05.580> improving<00:05:06.030> nature

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
think it'd be a big improving nature

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.960 
think it'd be a big improving nature
when<00:05:06.389> he<00:05:06.449> jumps<00:05:06.659> a<00:05:06.750> fence
