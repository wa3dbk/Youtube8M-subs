00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
more beefy that it only would be if you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
more beefy that it only would be if you
just<00:00:41.640> plug<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.000> directly<00:00:42.090> into<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.629> end<00:00:42.809> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
can use a short for it and we can plug

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.820 
can use a short for it and we can plug
it<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.040> right<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:15.320> instead<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> plugging<00:01:16.619> our

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it in right here instead of plugging our

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
going straight into the amplifier you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
going straight into the amplifier you
can<00:01:33.150> turn<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.780> aim<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
can turn on you can aim be it and you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.130

during the course of course sense a

during the course of course sense a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
little more busy then we need to have a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.550 
little more busy then we need to have a
pedal<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.940> floor<00:02:15.269> underneath<00:02:16.050> our<00:02:16.319> foot

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
pedal on the floor underneath our foot

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.350 
pedal on the floor underneath our foot
so<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.950> control<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.030> midst<00:02:18.299> of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so that we control it in the midst of

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.600 
so that we control it in the midst of
claim<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.750> song<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.680> only<00:02:19.890> solution<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
claim of song the only solution to that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.960 
claim of song the only solution to that
is<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.299> have<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.840> long<00:02:22.709> record<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
is to just have a long record and it's a
