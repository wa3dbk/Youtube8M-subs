00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 to 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.529
 to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.749
 to 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.749
 for drunk drivers or those responsible 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.049
 of most of the mishaps and as a result there are more victims 

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:30.049
 mortal 80 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.910
 In this context, I would like to add that transit agents that, like everyone else, are 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 the first cause of death at the national level 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.550
 of young people 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.500
 between 15 and 20 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.010
 in such a way that mexico represents in this case the second place 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.600
 of the largest number of people hit in the world 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.920
 and this because of human behavior 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830
 and undoubtedly these can 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.260
 or they can be modified in that sense 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.280
 within the country outline 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.660
 i in which the relationship of the 10 states 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.660
 which is mentioned as tamaulipas quintana roo aguascalientes 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.440
 colima federal district 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.490
 these have become a red focus of injuries by 80 are 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.320
 and it's largely is 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 those that are related 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.360
 in that sense mexico represented in the year 2009 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.620
 eight minors and 4 890 thousand car test taxi registered with 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.030
 serious consequences 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 in such a way that this generated 24 thousand deaths 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.830
 in accidents 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.000
 forty thousand addresses for disability and 7 700 thousand 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 hospitalization 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.200
 are the first cause of death in the population among five titles of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.570
 four years 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.240
 and that way 40% 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.480
 it is not an occurrence it is based on scientific evidence 40% 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.800
 traffic mishaps 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.020
 where 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.930
 generate fatalities are related 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.990
 with consumption 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.520
 of drinks 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.540
 so that 60% of injuries occur in this case in men 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.099
 but nevertheless 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.669
 there is an interesting growth in this framework women 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.729
 for which the gap between both sexes is shortened and 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.969
 he has put 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.839
 in motion various actions aimed 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.049
 coexistence with creation 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 the national television council 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.229
 and this is going to get the commitment 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.749
 where surveillance strategies control and compliance of the 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.049
 normativity 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.969
 and access to reliable and timely information 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969
 in the timely attention victims 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:54.019
 I must also add that the Mexican road safety initiative was designed 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.629
 that focus the main risk factors associated with accidents 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.389
 as they are 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.180
 first driving under the influence of alcohol 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.859
 yes the non-use of seatbelt and baby carrier 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.709
 as a clamping mechanism 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.689
 to protect some children 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.169
 and up to 1 point 40 meters and an approximate weight of 25 to 35 kilos 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 they should be protected in the back seat 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.659
 another one of the cases is 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.830
 the use of cell phones ok communication radios while 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.659
 he drives 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.129
 I want to emphasize that part of driving 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.429
 at speeding 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:43.719
 and that allows knowing in the specific case tijuana as reference point 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.209
 fast roads 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.109
 in that scheme according to the sources 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.119
 offered by inegi until 2008 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.389
 Tijuana represents 56% 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.629
 Cove 26% and 18% 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.959
 Mexicans 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.410
 tijuana river 1897 on the tijuana river third stage 659 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.069
 that the fast roads west and east 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.249
 likewise mariano matamoros with 637 north zone 631 and so on towards the 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.199
 low 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.049
 The order is considered in this case from January to August in the colonies that 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.120
 they represent greater incidence on the central and suburban area of ​​the Pipo River
