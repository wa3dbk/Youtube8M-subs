00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.049
 once on the moon an unusual baby was born 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.410
 I was born and it happened that he got 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.440
 where I found a lot of new friends 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.830
 feed but what happened next we 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.560
 by you now and find out 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.810
 you know how not to feed the cherry grows 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.930
 so far and the berries are so big 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.720
 we just do not bring their son as well as the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.900
 I want jam 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.109
 you can not bring them but you can 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.469
 stop 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:41.100
 I know how to finish the berries and you 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's build a berry about 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 not growing on the hill and if build 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.629
 gutter leaf 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:56.640
 of that orbit themselves will roll down and y and you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:02.780
 would put the pot berries wiring guys 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.670
 Well I did not understand this what are the berries 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 worth from berry pro doing here on our 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 the meadow did not exactly sit in any 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 another place but it is the most convenient 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.150
 route to deliver cherry berries to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.500
 our ivy song so be it to us not 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.500
 interfere continue 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:43.990
 it will rain a few first 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.180
 Well berries work successfully launched at all 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.960
 do not give me berries and I will add 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.960
 their our repository 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.730
 strange I like everything correctly calculated 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.030
 why are there no berries 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.950
 everything works but on the way they disappear 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:07.690
 see the roots apparently somewhere happened 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.119
 breaking I'll fly all the berries 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.480
 gone they have not sunk to the boiler 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.880
 we have collected so much where not dance 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.390
 let's separate and examine the berry 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.390
 rightness 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:28.510
 it's great when the berries themselves roll to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.930
 only in your mouth 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:39.340
 and enjoy wooded and pupsy 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:45.549
 you have not seen our such berries once 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:50.140
 We look after your berries and Well 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.980
 let's try to run more 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.739
 a few berries of cher and you had to fly and 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.620
 find a place where they disappear when 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.129
 will find give us a signal and we will come 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.129
 for help 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.099
 in progress 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:37.170
 shame on you that gets on our 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.470
 clearing is ours but we wanted to do 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:45.060
 jam for everyone and you were guests when 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:50.519

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.690
 do as you think foxy what are they 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.660
 conceived herd certainly conceived 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.660
 oh look seems to run again 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:24.340
 a good idea was to build a workaround 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:24.910
 I did not understand the way, but where are the berries of us alone ? 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.770
 it smells 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.840
 probably very tasty jam we're here 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:39.100
 This berries brought 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:41.650
 suddenly you miss i go you 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.950
 jam we were all glad that 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.810
 caterpillars returned the berries and most of all 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.810
 the caterpillars themselves rejoiced 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.370
 Mama 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.770
