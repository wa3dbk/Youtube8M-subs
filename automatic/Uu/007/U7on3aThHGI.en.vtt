 a year ago 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.880
 less than a year ago 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.410
 at first sight 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.050
 eo if it was unanimous based on a game or if it was a game based on an anime or if 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.859
 the game is a 100% game and then it was abounded with fran merida fan work 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.599
 in the case of the Japanese they knew him since the era of the pc 98 thing 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.210
 that since 2002 was taking flight with version 6 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.759
 more and one of many anecdotes was thanks to the famous ascri with the phrase p 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.749
 kity yes 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.230
 oo our red-and-yellow friend in pto master and lord of the happy little box he dedicated 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.210
 a cover of more than six figures in number of visits on this web 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.610
 on the other hand it was not long ago that one looked at the one that I will include this 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.540
 game and they lined up 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.950
 in large numbers 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.220
 to hills was with participatory videos known as worse 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.240
 it is thus in the peculiar case of trujillo a project whose scientific name 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.440
 project to invest 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.150
 chest at the hands of the Shanghai team alice good not so team that anecdote the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.170
 You can search in another web page 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.100
 come on if you know what I'm going to talk about then you already have knowledge about 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.460
 what it is about 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.820
 but anyway and to be simple conceptualized b 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 it's a game of type your theme exactly as bad as 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.120
 consists in evading right and left thousands of bullets whose distance between the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.580
 character and any bullet to fall is minimal and the friction between these are for 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.600
 pixels 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.700
 I have seen a similar case when I played agrarian 5 from the beach and 2 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.460
 the game has the essence and characteristics of this one and without parents 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.940
 salamander traiguén 1942 votes game that is vertical scroll 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.610
 according to some sources it was gradius one of the most famous matamarcianos made 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.250
 for the conami was the one that brought inspiration and one of the responsible 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.420
 that a man born in jacumba on March 18, 1977 with the name of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.380
 June already sold out famously known as sun because in a sound studio 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 of the cta and carried the name of xuntanza 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.960
 had the desire and inspiration to bring to light thousands of girls with 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.310
 a difficulty that hello you follow and follows her alone abandoned 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.599
 making a parenthesis 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.009
 if you listen to taito remember the famous to the dressing room of the eighties 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.259
 Well I do 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.450
 the drunkard is commonly liberal 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.440
 similar to the four freedoms of any linux program decided 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.370
 create these games to your duty to taste and with some drawings that in each edition do not 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.200
 You can distinguish the character well in each delivery because it changes up to the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.979
 face 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
 and that all the drawings are done the same 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.159
 my opinion 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 it seems not to maintain the same standard of drawing 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.049
 I will not fall 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.699
 I had a great friend 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.429
 the beer cans 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.499
 so 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.059
 sun takes a couple of beer bottles 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:56.369
 gets drunk 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.709
 create games with an inspiration in ethyl state 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.469
 and we have to compensate for his drunk of bullets in ethyl state 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.849
 fuck objectivity 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.379
 according to a documentary that I saw months ago the nose nobody support to learn 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.299
 both programming and drawing 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.069
 According to him, learning from other professionals is like taking something from him 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.139
 originality 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.859
 therefore this game is 80% June already votes and 20% inspired by the video game 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.859
 gradius mentioned earlier as in other franchises 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.429
 and in reality 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:31.549
 this game is the big host 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.879
 You pass like an amazing and flashing 50 minutes of pure dodge 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.839
 the north south east with this center and in places that do not exist that only god 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.419
 and the creator knows about veritas de veritas 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.959
 and if you are one of those blamed to the root of walnut gradius in a cloud of 255 you will pass 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.219
 some arrogant arrogant arrogant and star before 53 seconds of pure 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.019
 bullet graph in its most extreme difficulty 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.339
 do not fuck man 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.339
 about my first tour jo that I played was 8 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.529
 the interstate with nobody 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.069
 yes that same 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.669
 wait twenty minutes to finish the download i for the first time I tried the 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:12.889
 tour was an 8 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.669
 and it is the humble host 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.560
 has a graph if movements at 60 fronts per second that the ps2 says 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.819
 what the fuck 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.069
 because it has this 500 megawatts if I have four leagues and it has 60 fps 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.000
 that's how you look at the displacements the powers of the characters something that only 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:35.139
 equal to the artists of the current of abstract art instead of that you play 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.909
 killed you play to see abstract art drawings yes this game is an art 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:40.870
 abstract 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.479
 This game only looks points lines and spots halo abstract art 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.469
 dodge abstract art 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.219
 and only fighting with other abstract art 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.479
 what the hell were they thinking 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.580
 fucking mother 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.849
 something that other games do not have is that you do not need an e3 infuse to measure 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.780
 that the fans give them some shoes is huge 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.200
 they have their own and 3 measure inya bread is called the jacura convention 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.599
 israel in rita isabel 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:13.990
 instead of fan of the ps3 the xbox 360 and the wii meet all the private to this 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.710
 game 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.520
 after 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.479
 come ico video then 'youtube' and the anime forums that are very aware 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.129
 about the songs 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.629
 very remarkable the electronic piano 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.739
 and charming and sometimes melancholic to the point of being epic from the 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.990
 point of view of video games as well as a game of type your theme has met 

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.159
 totally your goal 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.110
 in which both the songs and the gameplay are very friendly 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.439
 not for something you remember cinde the crisis of the uned wazir or the wind waker 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.169
 law 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.009
 and not for something also your reaction was to look for a cover of these songs 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.650
 as the group 'I do single broadband timor ugly for example I recommend you 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.349
 this last one that band really destroys it in each metal version that takes out 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.810
 Now that I'm talking about songs, let me ask you this question 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.059
 i fantova john urízar or so that this does not happen that you split an explain 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:12.300
 you realized that these songs are oco pia today in spite of certain actions 

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:14.460
 games vote the songs 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.870
 If you give me the contra, do not be asshole, jover, I'll give you birth again with a 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.800
 explain 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.539
 the drunkard I do not know if it's plagiarism or inspiration I give you a little 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.090
