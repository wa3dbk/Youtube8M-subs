00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.160
 hello everyone's patients for 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.259
 a new video in minecraft so 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.980
 today I want to represent my park 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.059
 So this theme is that party 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.650
 a long time I have not done 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.219
 video so we will try to pass on 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.470
 this one so I feel very 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.180
 mountainous beehive kids tel shot at 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.860
 the rifle is forbidden for children under 12 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.250
 big eight and all this sensations 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.250
 strong 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.830
 So here we are going to do the first 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.949
 roller coaster because there are two 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.660
 and a big eight 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:42.879
 so let's go so it does not last 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.879
 long at nature and 25 seconds 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:50.679
 this part 10,1 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 so here I put a spiderweb 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 in the end for this stage it can not be a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.340
 little bit anyway 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 ua I fucked roads 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.960
 So that's the ghost house 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.650
 so cobweb or German 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 so here I am a little scared but it makes 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.679
 well what I've already been in gmail is 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.170
 childish at the fair is really 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.069
 tight loses a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.069
 it's in a gazelle side 1 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.270
 so I put the chickens for the noise 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.970
 simply 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.310
 here is the gemmi the benches I have not 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.630

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.440
 here 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.440
 after we have that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:39.770
 I do not like softly so here we have the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.840
 first water attraction 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.670
 so that's going to be the first part of 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.020
 my opinion of both worlds by 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.080
 the attraction waiting i'm going to the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.770

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.770
 old on that one 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.090
