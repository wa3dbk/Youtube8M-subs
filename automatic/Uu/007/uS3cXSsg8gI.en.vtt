 from the intensely criminal offenders in berlin 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.810
 have more than 80 percent one 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.059
 migration background and of which 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.730
 in turn, almost half are 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.500
 as far as the naked pay if you look 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.089
 which, of course, looks a little closer 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 you see that a big part of this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.680
 offenders to only very few large families 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 heard and these clans are the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.369
 notorious at police and justice since 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 years gets the state under 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.470
 control like the example of one of these 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 Families shows that's the story 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.679
 the family 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140

 pre-penalized at the beginning of the 80s 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.719
 entering Lebanon from the children 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.489
 A regular to school that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.950
 Jugendamt does not dare to go back 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.510
 outlaw in the middle of berlin 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 no solution most have anyway 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.550
 German passes family is an example 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 they are families that seem to be 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.489
 have decided outside the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 to live justice 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 the criminal record of family sounds 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.420
 live dramatically from the 15 children 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.770
 not all two brothers bill and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.689
 Ibrahim are dead 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 on the run from the police 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 a raid against the tree 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.479
 they were in urgent suspicion one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.950
 Innocent retiree at Potsdamer Platz 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.990
 to have died 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.759
 then a flight of the driver 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.820
 Germany made headlines 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.680
 another son Mohammed has as 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 twelve-year-old child his teacher 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.530
 pension age beats that is now three 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.570
 years ago 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.159
 who has now 15 years old mohammed 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.049
 a trial for sevenfold 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.360
 robbery behind him 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.950
 acquitted because of the burden witnesses 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.670
 in the last second, the whole blame 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.070
 took 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 Dad himself for drug trafficking 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.149
 pre-punished cares about his boys 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 Meanwhile, the youngest son of the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 twelve year old one at this year's 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.479
 miles of a 20-year-old woman 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.210
 knocked unconscious after one 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.909
 Fighting on the bumper car the laconic 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.369
 Comment from father as the police 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.990
 beat at home the father delivered 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.390
 noticed that was not bad 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.570
 because you as Hartz 4 receiver anyway nothing 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.030
 So you do not have to pay for pain 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:16.870
 into the money we are here in one 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:24.920
 area where crime is educated 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:28.400
 is loved and where the life 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.130
 we are not like the others we are 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.690
 only ourselves regulate our own 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.090
 apply where that to the law and to 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.010
 natural law of the family is raised 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.630
 outside the page structure is from 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.850
 these people recognized nothing 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.320
 you have the start 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.360
 at least the patriarch of this family 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.310
 have met the state as one 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.540
 structure that takes something from you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.540
 them taken home the assets 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.890
 almost taken the life taken 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.380
 here in Germany you have the state 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.890
 as an acquaintance of the anonymous 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.989
 gives social assistance for example and she 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.239
 have never learned the usual 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.080
 regulatory criteria of this state 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.180
 to stop 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.650
 abstract regulatory policies apply to 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.910
 they do not apply to them anyway 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.700
 through statute structures so 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.930
 power structure who does not want to live like this 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.330
 like to be disturbed 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.580
 when we visit the house in february 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.640
 We will not make family 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.640
 threatens but at least desperately insulted 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.670
 we are from the evening show how many 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.160
 Families of this route are in 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.260
 Berlin 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.620
 we are looking at about 20 30 families 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.390
 at and about 8000 people mean 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.400
 So it's not necessarily a lot 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.770
 big number plays that role it goes 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.110
 just about the intensity 8000 people 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.880
 just give up the accepted kirsten 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.830
 Heidig not the dedicated 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.320
 Judge wants to clean up now and 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.110
 that's what some youth offices are afraid of 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.230
 For years have missed the care 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.440
 doubt 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.610
 a life-threatening undertaking 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.590
 to summarize I can say that the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.690
 children from these families no chance 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.780
 have ever been in this society 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.130
 ingredient in the emerging sense too 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.840
 I'm not ready 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.459
 I'm concerned about the kids 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.620
 and there are many and I give them 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.260
 not on and when needed 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.180
 is the family court to involve and 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.550
 the family court's parental care 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.230
 withdraws or restricts the children 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.330
 must be housed foreign 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.520
 then that's the turkish one 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.740
 journalist güner balci is in Neukölln 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.810
 grew up and is meticulous for her 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.390
 Buch Arabs also researches them 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.080
 confirms the tremendous brutality 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.880
 inside the clans 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.410
 of course you would have to rather for 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.760
 So these people feel responsible 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.390
 especially for the children and for the 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.850
 youthful 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.710
 because the growing a system where 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.420
 very clear is how then your perspective 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.740
 is hopeless that is called 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.320
 they are here in this society 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.150
 Arrive here but you just do it 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.710
 not so actually should be at all 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.530
 many have long since the care 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.340
 20 years have been unsuccessful so far 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.530
 worked 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.290
 in this area and money and energy 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.850
 people given to it without any 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.980
 Whatever kind of success 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.630
 achieve that can not stay that way if 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.150
 we are not understood with ours 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.020
 Liberal attitude there we have ours 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.300
 attitude change 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.640
 A future for the lost children 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.390
 family o ought to feel that too 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.390
 to get
