use double-a batteries which is nice
because<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.510> camera<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.350> my

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I'm going and it might be left at the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.779 
I'm going and it might be left at the
bottom<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> canyon
