00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 This time the economy is divided, and the series No. 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:05.340
 Do you say 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.080
 But still entering the field once, such as laptop computers 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.610
 It is a familiar product 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.490
 It can be very useful, but this is the case 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 This battery contains a lithium ion battery 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.080
 It is small but you can eat a lot of energy 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.020
 The feature is that the contestants of the stress parliamentary activity election still continue 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.609
 I am 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.480
 Third day 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.329
 This was Japan in 1985 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.979
 Inoue's development of the future of Prabang Shinichi told 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.900
 But last month 24 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.500
 Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. announces calculation with adoption of lithium ion battery 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.250
 Was 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.500
 that name as well 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.860
 In the future, the mainstay of 1954 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 At Tokushima Office 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.030
 Within the year 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.030
 We will start full-scale mass production 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.800
 A major electronics company will expand production one after another 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 Lithium-ion battery focusing on research and development 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.140
 The test drive spreads further if it is used in electric vehicles and is environmentally friendly 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.030
 It is considered to be 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.430
 The partner is the lithium ion battery 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 It spread from Japan to the world in the same way as 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.230
 Hello 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.280
 This is 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.700
 The agricultural co-op is held in Hongo, and a forgotten great revival is held in Hayashima 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.230
 Mr. Akira Yoshino who likes lithium-ion batteries 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.980
 Established the world's first basic technology more than 20 years ago 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.800
 I have recovered 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.210
 In the first place what was the opportunity 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 Originally from that time the material research of the administration 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.540
 It is said that there was no idea of ​​working on driver development etc. this season 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.909
 Meanwhile, Li Acetylene 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.280
 Conducting electricity discovered by Professor Shirakawa of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.800
 It is plastic 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.050
 Takeshima-san can take charge and study in the process of studying acetylene 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.830
 Notice the possibility of using it as an electrode material for secondary batteries 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.010
 I 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.730
 I don't think it's a manifest, but I get a bad profit on travel 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.859
 It will be 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.180
 Meanwhile, the US economy is unclear 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.179
 Another difficult aspect came out 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.179
 To commemorate playing still 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.919
 Designated public facilities for strong carbon materials 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.199
 This is used for current funds 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.540
 Lithium ion battery 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.620
 Although light and small, high voltage can be obtained and can be charged 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.259
 It is the feature of 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.499
 But commercialization was not easy, but now 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.309
 It was the hardest 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 It's about the local 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.789
 Totally comfortable with electrical energy Melbourne safety how much 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.569
 Improve your baby 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.779
 I'm bringing it to the level of data 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.809
 It is the first 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:55.919
 Focus on these points 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.559
 A list of plagiarism incidents 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:03.359
 China became very responsive to relatives 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.699
 It's inside 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.819
 It's a secondary battery and it's a long train and it's over and over again 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.629
 Higher than children 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.229
 The nurse went up 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.859
 It has been quite easy 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.859
 It was difficult to commercialize 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.819
 Five years since the establishment of basic technology 1990 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.729
 Lithium-ion battery was commercialized for the first time 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:31.350
 The rate at which the first thing to go is also continued 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.589
 That 8mm video camera etc 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.139
 Because the Soviet Union Air Force can use batteries widely, 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.379
 Even if the battery is bigger, it is not 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.449
 But it can not be processed 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.449
 Or small and light rechargeable battery is in operation 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.199
 That's the second year of a big dry mist 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.190
 Lithium-ion battery production 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.979
 Touched sharply from 1995 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.499
 Create a mobile society that carries electronic devices 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.859
 have become 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.859
 Japan's top battery technology in the world 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.659
 Japan has already occupied 60% of new lithium ion batteries 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.359
 is 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.249
 But smaller and more powerful batteries 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.350
 Aimable development competition continues 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.410
 If there is a ball at the latest of lithium ion batteries 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.520
 It is a problem of lung cancer 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 It's always possible 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.110
 Executives by hand are also on the bribery side and golf 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.099
 To continue the 3 children death study in the concept Fukuoka City 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.259
 Predicting future lithium-ion batteries 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.590
 I'm sorry for this 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.750
 Oh yes 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.480
 We start with lithium ion rechargeable battery bone and start 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.469
 It is a present to give in 1994 if it says 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.610
 Fukuoka is not cordless yet on the 20th 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.219
 We could improve efficiency, but that is the next big task 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.219
 I think I wonder if the specific cordless charger 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.009
 My sister Reiko is on the move 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.159
 Yoshida who says that the way to the goal is still far 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.069
 From now on 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.129
 What kind of battery is born and changes the world 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.120
 I have talked about it, but it is true that until now, a rechargeable battery is called 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.580
 Is 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.330
 I'm eating out, but the output is bigger than below 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.770
 It spread even while releasing it, but from now on 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.300
 how 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.639
 It will be decided to appoint now 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.949
 I'm getting energy with wireless 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.469
 It is said that the basic research of 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:39.939
 Ne 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.309
 Mr. Kawashima, who is a Japanese bench and a lithium ion battery 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.600
 If you ask 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.939
 The bench is 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.479
 It is the study of the popular cartoonist in science 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.449
 Can be calculated 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.139
 I don't know what to do with data flat rates 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.779
 So the research that does not miss is very difficult and muddy 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.719
 It is necessary to use memetic 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.379
 You're far away, you know electrochemistry 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.539
 There's a field that doesn't 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:09.970
 I suppose 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.040
 That's right 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.490
 Moreover, Japan is that technology- 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.219
 If something new comes out as a measure as a basis 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.389
 It is dressed in the same town as it is said to try using it as a battery 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.520
 That's why the battery is so intractable that it will go ahead with speed 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.300
 In that 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.280
 You can expect from now on, right? It's mobile now. 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.110
 10 years are so warm and so just by bringing 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.729
 Opening 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.159
 The district court may be waiting
