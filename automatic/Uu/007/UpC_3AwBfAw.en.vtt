ruggedized case keep that in mind when
you<00:03:28.300> purchase<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.810> because<00:03:29.050> it's<00:03:29.200> going<00:03:29.320> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
you purchase it because it's going to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.100 
you purchase it because it's going to
add<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.950> bunch<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.400> bulk<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.910> your<00:03:31.060> Galaxy<00:03:31.720> s6

with the galaxy s6 defender in fact

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.420 
with the galaxy s6 defender in fact
everything<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:55.960> very<00:03:56.140> fluid<00:03:56.590> very<00:03:56.620> responsive

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
everything is very fluid very responsive

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.010 
everything is very fluid very responsive
however<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.090> do<00:03:58.300> feel<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.570> difference

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
however you do feel the difference

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.660 
however you do feel the difference
between<00:03:59.170> this<00:03:59.560> touch<00:03:59.770> screen<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.250> then<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
between this touch screen and then the

between this touch screen and then the
bare<00:04:00.850> screen<00:04:01.240> but<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:01.870> completely<00:04:02.050> doable

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
bare screen but it's completely doable

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.140

so<00:04:03.010> when<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.220> purchase<00:04:03.580> this<00:04:03.700> case<00:04:03.940> you're

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
so when you purchase this case you're

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.400 
so when you purchase this case you're
getting<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.480> for<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.720> protection<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.230> it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
getting it for the protection that it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.050 
getting it for the protection that it
offers<00:04:05.800> so<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.010> went<00:04:06.160> ahead<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.400> toss<00:04:06.610> my<00:04:06.820> phone

on<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.450> ground<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.930> see<00:04:08.110> how<00:04:08.320> well<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.800> would

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
on the ground to see how well it would

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.950 
on the ground to see how well it would
survive<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:09.970> on<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.270> bottom<00:04:10.480> part<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:10.870> the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
survive so on the bottom part of the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.570 
survive so on the bottom part of the
case<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.560> silicone<00:04:11.950> layer<00:04:12.160> there's<00:04:12.490> some

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
case on the silicone layer there's some

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.190 
case on the silicone layer there's some
scuffs<00:04:12.940> but<00:04:13.180> really<00:04:13.390> they<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.510> wipe<00:04:13.840> away<00:04:14.140> so

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
scuffs but really they just wipe away so

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.720 
scuffs but really they just wipe away so
I<00:04:14.380> think<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.800> just<00:04:14.920> some<00:04:15.130> dust<00:04:15.430> from<00:04:15.580> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
I think it's just some dust from the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.400 
I think it's just some dust from the
concrete<00:04:16.120> but<00:04:16.420> at<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.630> top<00:04:16.840> though<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.109> do

concrete but at the top though you do

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.349 
concrete but at the top though you do
have<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.650> small<00:04:17.770> abrasion<00:04:18.609> from<00:04:18.820> whether<00:04:19.090> it

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
have a small abrasion from whether it

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.090 
have a small abrasion from whether it
hit<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.570> rock<00:04:19.660> or<00:04:20.170> just<00:04:20.440> scuffed<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.950> the
