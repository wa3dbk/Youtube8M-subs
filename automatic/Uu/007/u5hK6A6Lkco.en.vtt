00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.550 
pan it's a 14 inch snare there is
actually<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> small<00:03:22.020> layer<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.380> weather

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
actually a small layer of weather

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.060 
actually a small layer of weather
stripping<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> inside<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:25.070> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
stripping on the inside of this and the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.800 
stripping on the inside of this and the
rim<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.370> goes<00:03:26.880> all<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.120> way<00:03:27.300> around<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.690> get

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
rim is goes all the way around and get

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.750 
rim is goes all the way around and get
perfect<00:03:28.140> 360-degree<00:03:28.890> rim<00:03:29.070> triggering<00:03:29.580> and

perfect 360-degree rim triggering and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.729 
perfect 360-degree rim triggering and
then<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.450> got<00:03:30.630> good<00:03:30.900> head<00:03:31.170> sugar<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
then you got good head sugar and a

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.010 
then you got good head sugar and a
positional<00:03:32.250> sensing<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.570> me<00:03:33.690> that's<00:03:33.900> kind

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
positional sensing and to me that's kind

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.420 
positional sensing and to me that's kind
of<00:03:34.140> important<00:03:34.560> i<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.800> my<00:03:34.950> positional

anyway<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:49.920> yeah<00:03:50.100> here's<00:03:50.459> how<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.670> trigger

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
anyway but yeah here's how the trigger

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.350 
anyway but yeah here's how the trigger
setup<00:03:51.420> works<00:03:51.660> here<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:53.030> platform<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
setup works here is a platform on the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.130 
setup works here is a platform on the
inside<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.850> head<00:03:57.270> trigger<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.810> actually

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
inside and the head trigger is actually

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.560 
inside and the head trigger is actually
on<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> upper<00:03:58.590> side<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.950> platform

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
on the upper side of the platform

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.670 
on the upper side of the platform
elevate<00:04:00.570> about<00:04:00.780> two<00:04:00.959> screws<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.650> know

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
elevate about two screws you know

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.640 
elevate about two screws you know
separated<00:04:02.520> with<00:04:02.640> rubber<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.480> inserts<00:04:04.470> I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
separated with rubber and inserts I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.390 
separated with rubber and inserts I
guess<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.160> then<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.540> access<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:08.220> know

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
guess and then on the access you know

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.479 
guess and then on the access you know
pan<00:04:08.880> itself<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.840> rim<00:04:10.050> trigger<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:11.040> that's

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
pan itself is the rim trigger so that's

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.220 
pan itself is the rim trigger so that's
what<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.700> get<00:04:11.910> your<00:04:12.090> 360<00:04:12.540> degree<00:04:12.810> room<00:04:12.989> sugar

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
what you get your 360 degree room sugar

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.420 
what you get your 360 degree room sugar
it's<00:04:13.410> directly<00:04:13.800> underneath<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.280> head

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
it's directly underneath the head

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.150 
it's directly underneath the head
trigger<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.650> actually<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> buddy<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:16.980> mine

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
trigger and actually a buddy of mine

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.920 
trigger and actually a buddy of mine

the<00:04:31.880> Tom<00:04:32.120> triggers<00:04:32.570> are<00:04:33.280> actually<00:04:34.280> just

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
the Tom triggers are actually just

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.680 
the Tom triggers are actually just
little<00:04:35.449> bars<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.500> just<00:04:36.680> go<00:04:36.830> across<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.690> then

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
little bars that just go across and then

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.730 
little bars that just go across and then
you<00:04:39.169> can<00:04:39.789> get<00:04:40.789> input<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:41.840> know<00:04:41.960> head<00:04:42.440> trigger

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
you can get input you know head trigger

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.050 
you can get input you know head trigger
in<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:42.949> middle<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.310> they<00:04:43.430> put<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.610> then<00:04:43.850> got

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
in the middle and they put it then got

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.670 
in the middle and they put it then got
rim<00:04:44.270> trigger<00:04:44.600> set<00:04:44.780> up<00:04:44.870> for<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> sides<00:04:45.350> here<00:04:45.650> I

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
rim trigger set up for the sides here I

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.469 
rim trigger set up for the sides here I
actually<00:04:46.009> got<00:04:46.340> these<00:04:46.520> done<00:04:46.759> for<00:04:47.000> me<00:04:47.150> because<00:04:47.389> I

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
actually got these done for me because I

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.670 
actually got these done for me because I
can't<00:04:47.690> see<00:04:47.870> good<00:04:48.020> enough<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.289> do<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:48.530> myself

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
can't see good enough to do it myself

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.140 
can't see good enough to do it myself
but<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.910> concept<00:04:50.449> was<00:04:50.509> there<00:04:51.009> nonetheless

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
but the concept was there nonetheless

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.430 
but the concept was there nonetheless
should<00:04:53.150> have<00:04:53.240> gotten<00:04:53.419> one<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.870> shrimp<00:04:54.169> sugar

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
should have gotten one and shrimp sugar

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.600 
should have gotten one and shrimp sugar
on<00:04:54.530> both<00:04:54.740> sides<00:04:55.009> there<00:04:55.340> have<00:04:55.430> been<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> lot

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
on both sides there have been a lot

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.180 
on both sides there have been a lot
better<00:04:55.759> but<00:04:56.330> nonetheless<00:04:57.110> I'm<00:04:57.830> going<00:04:57.949> to<00:04:58.009> wind

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
better but nonetheless I'm going to wind

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.379 
better but nonetheless I'm going to wind
up<00:04:58.220> getting<00:04:58.460> picked<00:04:58.669> cake<00:04:58.820> pans<00:04:59.090> for<00:04:59.240> him

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
up getting picked cake pans for him

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.480 
up getting picked cake pans for him
anyway<00:04:59.630> so<00:04:59.690> what's<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.050> point<00:05:00.320> but<00:05:01.280> yeah

concerned it's not too bad you know it's
like<00:05:43.520> your<00:05:44.000> typical<00:05:44.180> mesh<00:05:44.570> heads<00:05:44.780> are<00:05:44.930> not<00:05:45.080> too

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
like your typical mesh heads are not too

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.439 
like your typical mesh heads are not too
loud<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:46.070> cake<00:05:46.310> pan<00:05:46.550> does<00:05:46.760> give<00:05:47.000> yourself

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
loud the cake pan does give yourself

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:54.070 
loud the cake pan does give yourself
your<00:05:47.599> drum<00:05:48.380> a<00:05:48.710> really<00:05:49.340> unique<00:05:49.520> tone<00:05:49.909> I<00:05:53.080> mean

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
your drum a really unique tone I mean

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.629 
your drum a really unique tone I mean
it's<00:05:54.199> not<00:05:54.380> loud<00:05:54.560> by<00:05:54.800> any<00:05:55.010> means<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.370> mean<00:05:55.520> it's

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
it's not loud by any means I mean it's

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.120 
it's not loud by any means I mean it's
quieter<00:05:56.000> than<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:57.460> yes<00:05:58.460> so<00:05:58.880> yeah<00:05:59.150> I<00:06:00.130> guess

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
quieter than this yes so yeah I guess

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.439 
quieter than this yes so yeah I guess
you<00:06:01.220> could<00:06:01.280> say<00:06:01.430> it's<00:06:01.550> not<00:06:01.639> too<00:06:01.849> much<00:06:02.030> quieter

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
you could say it's not too much quieter

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.200 
you could say it's not too much quieter
but<00:06:02.570> the<00:06:02.690> attack<00:06:02.990> is<00:06:03.169> definitely<00:06:03.620> quiet<00:06:04.180> but<00:06:05.180> I

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
but the attack is definitely quiet but I

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.670 
but the attack is definitely quiet but I
don't<00:06:05.479> beat<00:06:05.659> the<00:06:05.810> tar<00:06:06.050> out<00:06:06.259> of<00:06:06.289> it<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:06.650> know

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
don't beat the tar out of it you know

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.490 
don't beat the tar out of it you know
and<00:06:07.099> then<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.909> got<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.449> know<00:06:08.570> typical<00:06:09.259> Tom's

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
and then I got you know typical Tom's

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.409 
and then I got you know typical Tom's
these<00:06:09.889> are<00:06:10.009> part<00:06:10.190> of<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.310> Quietus<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:17.150> then
