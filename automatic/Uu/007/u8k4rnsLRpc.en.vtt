00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.099
 welcome to my little one 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.890
 test and check to this mini controller 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.750
 that is dmc attacks in the e100 you are looking 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.830
 Rest in now and see you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.830
 in the next clip 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.200
 Now we come to the scope of delivery 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.550
 next to the user manual is still 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.989
 a usb cable and a full version of 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.850
 goodbody a lot in it 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.110
 You can write down the code 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.690
 little fun 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.879
 of course that has been distorted 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.190
 I just hit some code on it 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.650
 so sweetie not so with you now if 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.650
 her hat happy totally horny 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.880
 let us now come to the different ones 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.830
 decks while sdk just as well as 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.190
 For example, and start with Dean best completely 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.869
 below 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:31.759
 Here we have a play break button 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:35.330
 uplay and a set kyu button beside it 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:41.330
 of course the crossfader we go 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:45.410
 further up we have the job as with 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.770
 which we can do two ways 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.099
 once scratch and through this button 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.360
 up here also pitch bend that is with 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.000
 this job how can i do that too 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.200
 speed control next to it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.319
 The pitch error we with virtual dj 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 throttle in different percentages 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:18.650
 then we can have it here now 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:22.849
 I create the looks section of the camera 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.630
 once in a while after a sync 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.520
 Taste around with how to adjust the bpm time 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.890
 can and a pfl 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.650
 I say this deck always has that 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.980
 full command so you can 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.420
 of course choose whether that of the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:48.050
 to have command or deck b with 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:51.940
 We have this pr t button next to it 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:56.260
 three professionals once around the basses 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.430
 filter out once for the means 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 once to filter out the middle 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.270
 and once to turn up the heights 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.020
 I still have a game controller you can 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.910
 actually pretty much never needs it here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.430
 above is the effect section 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.290
 with which we call different effects 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.860
 can and these dock and up 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.210
 we can confirm this 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.130
 volume of the one effect and here the 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.380
 volume of the other effect rule 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.050
 Here , for example, there is a fraser and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.620
 here for example a siren here still 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:37.700
 a register to fix patch panels 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.590
 That's exactly what my functions were 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.530
 how much us in the next clip in the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.760
 virtual dj software so if we are now 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.760
 the device via usb 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:58.250
 this is a usb of the 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.130
 the back we connect that and the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.370
 buttons light up as you can see now 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.370
 can 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.069
 then we start virtual dj 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:24.160
 and can now over this part only 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.669
 let's choose which song we have 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.740
 would like 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.940
 if we have the different folders too 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.500
 The shift must come and cover back 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.199
 now something in the computer itself 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.360
 pull that between us 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:44.350
 different folders can choose 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:50.160
 of course also looking for 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:52.780
 example kst 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.949
 Of course I 'm only here gema free 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:02.110
 leader is clear and can now 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.830
 if we look at the other camera that 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.830
 start song 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.120
 and again I can stop now 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.080
 first the master rules that is like 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.310
 a lot should come out of the box and 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.870
 then, of course, individual volumes 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.870
 I can put a point now 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.729
 Now I can play the queue over 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:51.740
 leave as often as I want, of course 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.580
 I find cool is displayed here 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.580
 which video 

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:59.199
 does not always work 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:02.799
 100% but definitely 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.999
 my great feature then we can 

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:07.989
 incorporate effects 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:11.289
 you can do that now, for example, from grad 

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:12.969
 on the laptop, for example, I do 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.519
 Now here's a backspin a break 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.149
 Echo or a flanger pure and care 

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.149
 it sounds like that 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:32.499
 then i can get the effect over this 

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:33.839
 about these proteins in the volume 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:39.099
 change 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:41.919
 yes and what is on deck b can of course 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:52.329
 also play 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:59.049
 I invite my song to the point 

00:06:52.329 --> 00:07:05.409
 put and again here I can 

00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:12.029
 Incorporate effect you can now here 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:12.029
 best and bring the heights out 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.180
 then we can sketchen 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:42.919
 if we briefly light this 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:47.620
 button then we can make it girl out 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:47.620
 then make it a patch to the regulator 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:08:03.229
 then of course we can do the pitch as well 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:08:05.900
 over this missing and in the large and 

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:07.880
 It was all natural and me 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.160
 am delighted that they have to looked and 

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.030
 as in the end I am always practice 

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.030
