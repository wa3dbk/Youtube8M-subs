00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.830
 Hello, we are here and we have the answer ready 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
 not afraid of my dead 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.069
 Naldo Altona de 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.069
 no one who studied how was your day 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.829
 very awful 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.640
 the smoke from the coal power plant 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.820
 it was so tight 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.519
 who could not see himself 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 and the windmills so loud that I could not hear my favorite song 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.860
 There is not a solution to these problems 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.090
 but of course doctor tastes 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.730
 Tecton force 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.830
 some people are afraid of nuclear power 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.980
 but that I lay unfounded 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 Hello hello, say hello year Hello 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.540
 that would have worked 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.000
 a totally clean thing 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.410
 but nuclear power is renewable to me 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.710
 you notice their light 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.810
 HKW it must be renewed every 15 to 20 years 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.870
 Super but where do you leave all the nuclear waste 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.410
 this is not a problem 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.320
 far goes that a special rail network for Castortransporte the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.830
 then drive around in circles forever and so we have no repository problem anymore 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.970
 Georg calms me down though 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.140
 what about a super-gau 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 Example through a terrorist attack 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.860
 counting 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 look what children are 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.160
 you did well Atomique 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.390
 but says my keg is concerned with the consequences of radioactive radiation around that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.840
 you do not go to the barber anymore and that saves money as well 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.630
 You can get sweets right now, so you would be sweets 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 Lower Rhine forbid me sweet sweets 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 allowed i need 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.450
