00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.650
 Hello dear friends with you raki in 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.340
 hangar and now I'll tell you about this 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.680
 interesting tanks like m4a 38 sherman or 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.480
 simply rushing iv as always start with 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.880
 features what makes it different from 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.390
 other sixth-level ester oh well 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 let's start 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.580
 let's start with what is average 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.200
 tank and he should have quite good 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.870
 mobility the way it is 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.370
 Sherman has excellent dynamics 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.640
 maximum speed of 48 kilometers 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.920
 hour 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.290
 even though this is the worst figure among the pack 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.640
 level six for example for comparison y 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.750
 t-34 85 54 kilometers per hour and clouds 3002 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.790
 m55 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 but unlike them the screen is gaining it 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.290
 much easier due to its low mass 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.360
 at 30 tons and engine capacity of five hundred 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.800
 twenty horsepower this tank 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.180
 has the best rate of speed 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.550
 chassis turning 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.690
 again the environment is 100 sixth level 40 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.690
 degrees per second 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.860
 speed of rotation of the tower is also quite good 39 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.140
 degrees per second 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.200
 as for booking here he 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.050
 the cardboard front of the body 63 board and feed 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.440
 38 millimeters and booking a tower forehead 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.479
 76 board and feed by 50 one millimeter 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.560
 that is, join in a fierce exchange of fire in 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.360
 melee is highly discouraged 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.369
 now move on to arming Sherman and on 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.890
 him you can put a fabass from 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.630
 m4 but I strongly advise not because 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 against the seventh eighth levels she 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.909
 virtually useless and of course 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.130
 you can put on top of it 76 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.170
 mm gun m1a 2 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.600
 feature of this instrument is that it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.430
 possesses just mad dpm because 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.850
 its rate of fire is 10 half 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.890
 shots per minute and damage of 120-200 units 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.980
 not hard to calculate what the average damage in 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.680
 minute this gun about 1600 80 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.540
 units of damage per minute is natural 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.090
 the best rate among the 100 sixth 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.140
 level but unfortunately 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.709
 armor penetration of this weapon is extremely 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.510
 low 96 or 160 millimeters but how 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.530
 the rule is all solved by subcaliber 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.959
 shells piercing 133 dashes 221 times 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.910
 note two point three seconds and 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.430
 spread over 100 meters by as many as four 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.950
 tenths in principle, these figures are similar 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.910
 with other CTS level 6 and Sherman them 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.700
 practically not inferior 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.500
 let's move on to the next question 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.810
 what to install on sherman and and gear 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.180
 and from the equipment and equipment I personally 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.500
 leave rem universal kit 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.230
 recovery kit and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.990
 fire extinguisher from the equipment I put 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.240
 rammer reinforced aiming drives and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.760
 stabilizer and vertical lay 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.860
 Now such a question what tactics of battle 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.540
 You can use this tank you 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.400
 must understand that Sherman has 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.260
 excellent vertical guidance angles 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.120
 so it will allow us to roll out 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.070
 because of some hill and give an account 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.410
 over the enemy and then hide back 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.300
 since booking a tower does not allow 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.130
 we do not tank on this tank 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.140
 preferably use tactics 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.670
 battles at medium distances and, moreover, on 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.500
 areas where you can always 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.080
 hide behind some kind of shelter 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.810
 well, finally let's see the fight in 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.970
 which you will see all the advantages of m4a 38 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.110
 Sherman I talked about earlier 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.110
 so look 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.130
 and 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 but 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.110
 also 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.110
 . 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.849
 i can 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 iphone 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.490
 but 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.980
 j 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.139
 but 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.650
 and 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.410
 but 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.399
 but 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.330
 so 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.280
 Here is such a fight I apologize for 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.460
 small logs do not know where they suddenly 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.620
 undertook let's summarize m 438 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.050
 sherman medium tank with excellent 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.000
 dynamics yes right on gun but weak 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.960
 booking and small 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.730
 armor penetration on this tank 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.040
 preferably lead a firefight on 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.570
 middle distances and on that terrain 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.540
 where we can use the corners 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.280
 Vertical tip all thanks that 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.050
 watched this video hope it is you 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.210
 I liked it and if you liked it 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.340
 put your finger up subscribe to 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.500

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.040
 you will find in the description to see you soon 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.040
