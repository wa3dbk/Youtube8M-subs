00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi guys often ask me 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 what about and how about hands doing something 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.650
 Cossacks for example choose to sit there still 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.900
 that tweet key combinations everything else 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 I decided to make a separate video about everything 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 show this i will show what i know 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.970
 there is still i will show the most desired mode 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 which I apply everything else in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.400
 principle is important too but we will find it 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 I myself will show exactly those that I apply to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 meat firstly pause the game 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.719
 keyboard you have a button pose for y 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.180
 you somewhere above the right side 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.930
 keyboards over backspace for example 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 located 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.910
 and thus the game can be paused 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.770
 so that you can take some 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.539
 solutions 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 This button works in a network game so 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.350
 what if you need a network game 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.829
 pause too can use 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 but your opponent may pause and 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.020
 wish further if we want with you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 build several buildings at once too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.829
 there are certain methods for this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.930
 we select all workers by the way that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.270
 select all you can use control 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.630
 hey like skate to pick everything 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 control and this select each unit on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.400
 map in principle 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 select the building and press shift 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.770
 clamp shift and wash clamped shifto 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.479
 left click where we are 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.320
 want to put a building here for example you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.119
 put 33 urban center and they will 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.220
 they can be built in turn from 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.940
 Malaysian grandchildren workers here to build 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.619
 so let's say 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.000
 immediately 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.220
 distributed and built themselves as 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.040
 will want 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.229
 further one more useful useful thing 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:49.509
 if you need to go on the attack press a 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:52.840
 on the keyboard and to our on the keyboard and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.270
 right click on the map and your 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.670
 peasant warriors or whoever 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.990
 I was going home and I would sleep all 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.970
 on your way further more useful commands and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.009
 these are useful cheats 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.659
 if you want to open the card in 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.860
 singleplayer multiplayer Th you do not 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.690
 work supervisor useful to water 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.390
 cool calipers so openly wipe 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.989
 nothing changes and if you need 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.840
 money 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.060
 again single player type mane and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 you have 50,000 of all resources 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.310
 it increases you can drink 50 thousand 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.380
 all all resources in general are the most 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.680
 useful teams in the Cossacks that I 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.280
 found there are more useful commands but 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.739
 these colors are the ones that use their personal 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.560
 The games are very useful and very good 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.810
 also work 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.060
 still useful to use it to put 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 collection point but I think everyone knows it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 choose a collection point with the right button 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.690
 click on the resource on the tree on the stone can 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.030
 on the building to the mine 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.580
 although it does not work with mines 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.450
 chess work as I remember on 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.040
 a stone on a tree on a wheat field and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.370
 you workers will go wheat fields and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.130
 will be there to get what you need to be in 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.930
 In general, the most important team is also 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.470
 can select all non-performing 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.910
 the peasants are all empty mines but this is already 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.500
 can be done through the city center in 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.860
 Basically pretty all onions 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.019
 convenient thanks for watching let's say 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.540
 I also use such commands for the Cossacks 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.790
 greatly simplifies the life of those that I showed 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.920
 there are more that make life easier 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.069
 more but I take you to the most basic with 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.290
 steel you can figure out yourself 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.340
 and you still have to choose units 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 which are on screen which is 1 class 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.989
 you can just double click and we 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.740
 select only those units that you have 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.920
 is on the screen and 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.800
 Class 1 for example, here are the peasants and we remove 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.720
 all who are micro and if we choose tarte 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.460
 the peasants of the morning now would be surprisingly not 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.640
 extremely heaven they are not chosen 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.410
 you can also drive it but i think everything and 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.300
 the same building can be built with 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.460
 keys as each building goes 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.470
 matches the key as each 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.110
 team basically if you want 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.739
 tell the soldier to brush these scenes from 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.280
 keys that is wrong click l blacksmith 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.230
 blacksmith appears 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.260
 maybe learn all these commands already 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.500
 will be problematic and domain problems 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.690
 the whole world but maybe if you 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.720
 good memory can be learned and will 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.350
 quickly everyone needs his thanks for 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.230
 viewing 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.290
 oh yes yes yes last thing i forgot is 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.990
 you need to remove the building or remove 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.610
 peasants can click david on 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.680
 keyboard in principle yes we are any 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.680
 keyboard is even on notebooks even 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.130
 On netbooks, you must have a key 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.130
 david and see when not burning now 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.440
 click david garrett anything else 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.380
 can destroy using love and all that 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.690
 please also if captured enemy 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.550
 city ​​or enemy units also advise 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.980
 use david and destroy them this 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.500
 the only way zan is unity and 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.270
 way to destroy your building or 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.400
 unit you own all of you 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.430
 overpopulation you need to get rid of 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.260
 certain units use money 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.820
 or all very useful commands 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.820
 for watching and bye
