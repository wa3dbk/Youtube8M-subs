that the airbag is held on by three ten
millimeter<00:01:02.420> bolts<00:01:02.659> one<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:04.210> three<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:05.960> got

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
millimeter bolts one two three so I got

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.680 
millimeter bolts one two three so I got
my<00:01:06.409> ratchet<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.430> extension<00:01:08.180> makes<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.630> a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
my ratchet with a extension makes it a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.920 
my ratchet with a extension makes it a
little<00:01:08.780> easier<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.650> my<00:01:09.740> ten<00:01:09.950> millimeter

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
little easier and my ten millimeter

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.350 
little easier and my ten millimeter
which<00:01:11.930> let's<00:01:12.260> go<00:01:12.409> ahead<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.060> remove<00:01:14.060> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
which let's go ahead and remove the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:43.190 
which let's go ahead and remove the
three<00:01:14.540> bolts<00:01:14.720> there<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.530> go<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:16.700> hand<00:01:16.909> dude

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.910 

once<00:01:44.200> they're<00:01:44.380> loose

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
once they're loose

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.309 
once they're loose
I<00:01:44.950> like<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:46.210> easier<00:01:46.600> if<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:46.840> turn<00:01:47.259> it

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
I like it's easier if you just turn it

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.440 
I like it's easier if you just turn it
by<00:01:47.500> hand<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.280> lot<00:01:51.429> faster<00:01:51.670> turning<00:01:52.390> by

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
by hand it's a lot faster turning by

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.449 
by hand it's a lot faster turning by
hand

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
hand

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:09.720 
hand
but<00:01:54.459> either<00:01:55.390> way<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.869> hard

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.300 

okay<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.180> we've<00:02:11.480> got<00:02:11.510> our<00:02:11.660> three<00:02:11.870> bolts<00:02:12.320> out

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.470
