modern warfare 3 and today I'm going to
be<00:00:16.020> pointing<00:00:16.289> out<00:00:17.300> that<00:00:18.300> there's<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.230> more

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
be pointing out that there's a lot more

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.730 
be pointing out that there's a lot more
hit<00:00:19.740> markers<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:21.140> snipers<00:00:22.140> especially<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
hit markers with snipers especially the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.790 
hit markers with snipers especially the
MSR<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.779> msi<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:26.869> I'd<00:00:27.869> say<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.500> got

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
MSR the msi is like I'd say it's got

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.749 
MSR the msi is like I'd say it's got
gets<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> most<00:00:29.400> hit<00:00:29.670> markers<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.750> think

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
gets the most hit markers and I I think

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.130 
gets the most hit markers and I I think
Activision<00:00:32.759> should<00:00:33.090> sort<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.660> problem<00:00:33.719> out

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
Activision should sort this problem out

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.389 
Activision should sort this problem out
that's<00:00:34.410> why<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.770> thinking<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> video<00:00:35.280> up

there's<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> floor<00:01:47.759> i<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:51.020> what

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there's the floor i think so that's what

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.249 
there's the floor i think so that's what
was<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.579> thus<00:01:53.579> annoying<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.170> have

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
was a thus annoying because I could have

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.859 
was a thus annoying because I could have
had<00:01:55.380> four<00:01:55.649> kills<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.689> all<00:01:57.689> i<00:01:57.750> get

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
had four kills right then and all i get

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
had four kills right then and all i get
is<00:01:58.020> hit<00:01:58.259> markets<00:01:58.649> i<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.790> i<00:01:59.880> could<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.149> had

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
is hit markets i think i could have had

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.060 
is hit markets i think i could have had
a<00:02:00.270> collapse<00:02:00.689> well<00:02:00.990> because

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
a collapse well because

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.819 
a collapse well because

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.080 
there's another hitmarker see yeah I
could<00:02:07.130> have<00:02:07.219> had<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.399> collapse<00:02:07.640> back<00:02:07.850> then

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
could have had to collapse back then

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.860 
could have had to collapse back then

l 118 is good guns will I use that I've
had<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.440> goal<00:02:33.709> twice<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:36.069> yes<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.310> like

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.660 
had that goal twice and yes I like
snipers<00:02:38.349> but<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.590> don't<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.220> these<00:02:40.430> hit

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
snipers but I just don't like these hit

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.729 
snipers but I just don't like these hit
markers<00:02:41.030> at<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.209> moment<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.720> Activision<00:02:42.440> are

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
markers at the moment and Activision are

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.640 
markers at the moment and Activision are
supposed<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.160> be<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.780> know<00:02:44.900> they're<00:02:45.410> supposed

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
supposed to be you know they're supposed

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.870 
supposed to be you know they're supposed
to<00:02:45.739> be<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.280> more<00:02:46.849> into<00:02:47.660> snipers<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.170> stuff

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
to be like more into snipers and stuff

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.460 
to be like more into snipers and stuff
which<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.180> say<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.930> think<00:02:51.230> they<00:02:51.319> should

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
which they say so I think they should

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.539 
which they say so I think they should
sort<00:02:51.739> out<00:02:51.829> this<00:02:51.950> problem<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:54.170> think<00:02:54.950> they

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
sort out this problem and I think they

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.089 
sort out this problem and I think they
actually<00:02:55.579> i'm<00:02:56.150> not<00:02:56.329> sure<00:02:56.599> but<00:02:56.630> i<00:02:57.019> think<00:02:57.769> they

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
actually i'm not sure but i think they

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.720 
actually i'm not sure but i think they
took<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.340> bit<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:58.849> damage<00:02:59.060> off<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.569> snipers<00:02:59.989> in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
took a bit of damage off the snipers in

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
took a bit of damage off the snipers in
one<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> patches<00:03:02.390> they<00:03:02.660> might<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.019> set

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
one of the patches they might not set

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.430 
one of the patches they might not set
about<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.709> but<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.549> just<00:03:05.000> feel<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.260> get

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
about it but I just feel that you get

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.400 
about it but I just feel that you get
more<00:03:06.680> hitmarkers<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:08.150> recently<00:03:08.569> since

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
more hitmarkers just recently since

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
they've done a couple of patches at the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.340 
they've done a couple of patches at the
style<00:03:12.739> was<00:03:12.829> fine<00:03:13.160> now<00:03:13.940> for<00:03:14.840> some<00:03:14.989> reason<00:03:15.170> you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
style was fine now for some reason you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.400 
style was fine now for some reason you
just<00:03:15.470> get<00:03:15.680> hit<00:03:15.859> market<00:03:16.190> after<00:03:16.519> hit<00:03:16.700> markers<00:03:17.410> so

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
this isn't a very long video coming up

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.280 
this isn't a very long video coming up
it's<00:03:40.370> six<00:03:41.299> minutes<00:03:41.660> when<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.870> normally<00:03:42.200> do

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
it's six minutes when I normally do

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.500 
it's six minutes when I normally do
about<00:03:42.440> nine<00:03:42.709> minutes<00:03:42.889> but<00:03:43.310> still<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.389> good

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
about nine minutes but still it's a good

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.890 
about nine minutes but still it's a good
video<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.919> I'm<00:03:46.160> I'm<00:03:46.700> said<00:03:47.329> what<00:03:47.480> I'm<00:03:47.569> playing

game<00:03:52.549> type<00:03:52.849> which<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.329> came<00:03:53.480> out<00:03:53.540> in<00:03:53.750> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
game type which just came out in the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.629 
game type which just came out in the
last<00:03:53.989> patch<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.560> been<00:03:54.709> out<00:03:54.889> on<00:03:57.280> split<00:03:58.280> screen

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
last patch it's been out on split screen

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.259 
last patch it's been out on split screen
but<00:03:59.230> you<00:04:00.230> know<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.709> hasn't<00:04:01.010> been<00:04:01.489> eyeing

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
but you know it hasn't been eyeing

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.059 
but you know it hasn't been eyeing
multiplayer<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.870> they<00:04:02.959> just<00:04:03.139> pour<00:04:03.380> it<00:04:03.470> out<00:04:03.560> so

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
multiplayer and they just pour it out so

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.180 
multiplayer and they just pour it out so
I<00:04:04.609> think<00:04:05.299> it's<00:04:05.660> fun<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.049> get<00:04:06.200> 20<00:04:06.739> points<00:04:06.919> per

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
I think it's fun you get 20 points per

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.250 
I think it's fun you get 20 points per
seconds<00:04:07.880> if<00:04:08.060> you're<00:04:08.239> inside<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.780> drop<00:04:08.989> zone

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
seconds if you're inside the drop zone

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.960 
seconds if you're inside the drop zone
you<00:04:10.069> get<00:04:10.250> care<00:04:10.519> packages

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
you get care packages

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.230 
you get care packages
once<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:13.020> get<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> certain<00:04:13.620> amount<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:14.240> drop

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
once you get a certain amount of drop

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.940 
once you get a certain amount of drop
zone<00:04:15.650> XP<00:04:16.650> sofee<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:18.110> CS<00:04:19.110> so<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.500> pretty<00:04:19.680> fun

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
zone XP sofee and CS so it's pretty fun

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.890

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.340 
time which gets you quite a few points
and<00:04:31.700> I<00:04:33.290> think<00:04:34.290> in<00:04:34.590> head<00:04:34.950> cause<00:04:35.220> it's<00:04:35.610> 20<00:04:36.060> /<00:04:36.350> 5

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
and I think in head cause it's 20 / 5

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.550 
and I think in head cause it's 20 / 5
seconds<00:04:37.980> which<00:04:38.190> isn't<00:04:38.520> very<00:04:39.290> which<00:04:40.290> isn't

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
seconds which isn't very which isn't

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.920 
seconds which isn't very which isn't
very<00:04:40.590> good<00:04:40.910> when<00:04:41.910> you<00:04:42.030> find<00:04:42.270> out<00:04:42.420> this<00:04:43.970> beer<00:04:44.970> so

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
very good when you find out this beer so

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.440 
very good when you find out this beer so
I'd<00:04:46.320> say<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.890> good<00:04:47.040> game<00:04:47.070> type<00:04:47.490> it's

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
I'd say this is a good game type it's

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.780 
I'd say this is a good game type it's
not<00:04:48.630> very<00:04:48.810> good<00:04:48.930> for<00:04:49.080> kills<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.770> don't<00:04:49.950> think<00:04:50.190> I

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
not very good for kills I don't think I

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.220 
not very good for kills I don't think I
don't<00:04:51.300> get<00:04:51.420> that<00:04:51.540> many<00:04:51.660> killers<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.140> it

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
don't get that many killers in it

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.140 
don't get that many killers in it
normally<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.680> domination<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.430> get<00:04:53.610> about<00:04:53.700> 50

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
normally in domination I get about 50

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.210 
normally in domination I get about 50
kills<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.480> match<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.340> get<00:04:56.640> about<00:04:57.330> 20

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
kills a match in this I get about 20

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.680 
kills a match in this I get about 20
it's<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.310> bit<00:04:59.460> more<00:04:59.700> like<00:04:59.940> team<00:05:00.270> deathmatch

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
it's a bit more like team deathmatch

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.180 
it's a bit more like team deathmatch
about<00:05:01.050> capturing<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:03.390> drop<00:05:03.810> zone<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.040> get

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
about capturing the drop zone so you get

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.659 
about capturing the drop zone so you get
points<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.669> way<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:07.710> yeah<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.220> more<00:05:08.370> people

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
points that way so yeah the more people

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.150 
points that way so yeah the more people
wait<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:08.970> have<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.510> faster<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.890> win<00:05:11.040> the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
wait you have in the faster you win the

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.280 
wait you have in the faster you win the
match<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:12.060> it's<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.360> bit<00:05:12.510> like<00:05:12.660> headquarters

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
match so it's a bit like headquarters

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
match so it's a bit like headquarters
and<00:05:13.440> team<00:05:14.040> deathmatch<00:05:14.370> days<00:05:14.640> there<00:05:15.919> no<00:05:16.919> skype

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
and team deathmatch days there no skype

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.180 
and team deathmatch days there no skype
hitmarker<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.690> left<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.590> cam<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.070> can

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.010 
hitmarker and I left the cam so you can
see<00:05:20.370> but<00:05:20.520> I<00:05:20.580> gotta<00:05:20.730> hit<00:05:20.880> marker<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:22.770> say<00:05:23.580> yeah

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
I think this is the only way to get the

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.950 
I think this is the only way to get the

seriously there I think they like the
most<00:05:53.729> iPad<00:05:54.180> gun<00:05:54.450> and<00:05:54.950> i've<00:05:55.950> been<00:05:55.979> using<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.520> g

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
most iPad gun and i've been using the g

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.800 
most iPad gun and i've been using the g

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
free is it SC or something i'm not sure

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.810 
free is it SC or something i'm not sure
but<00:06:02.990> yeah<00:06:03.990> that<00:06:04.410> we've<00:06:04.620> red<00:06:04.860> dot<00:06:05.100> is<00:06:05.220> also<00:06:05.610> way

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820
