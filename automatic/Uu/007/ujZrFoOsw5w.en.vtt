00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
a painting and that allows you to just

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.620 
a painting and that allows you to just
jump<00:00:20.490> through<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.330> where<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
use this store right here which is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
use this store right here which is
actually<00:00:46.590> key<00:00:46.860> activated<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> one

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
actually key activated so for this one

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520 
actually key activated so for this one
you're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> want<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> toss<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.050> block<00:00:49.320> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you're going to want to toss a block on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.900 
you're going to want to toss a block on
the<00:00:49.620> inside<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.460> dismissed<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the inside of it which they dismissed it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
the inside of it which they dismissed it
let's<00:00:51.090> try<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.300> again<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:52.020> mr.<00:00:52.379> Galatea

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
let's try that again this mr. Galatea

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
let's try that again this mr. Galatea
third<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.280> charm<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.600> go

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
third time is the charm and there we go

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.910 
third time is the charm and there we go
right<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> block<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.649> there

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
right so we have a block in there

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.380 
right so we have a block in there
hopefully<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.640> spot<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.300> now

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
hopefully it's in the right spot and now

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.790 
hopefully it's in the right spot and now
you're<00:00:57.539> gonna<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.809> from<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.500> jump

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you're gonna do from here is just jump

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
you're gonna do from here is just jump
through<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.910> tell<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> walk

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
through and as you can tell you can walk

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.970 
through and as you can tell you can walk
right<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.050> through<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.620> good<00:01:01.800> thing

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
right on through and the good thing

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
right on through and the good thing
about<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.910> second<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> actually

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
about this is the second you actually

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.939 
about this is the second you actually
jump<00:01:03.870> through<00:01:04.140> you're<00:01:04.350> gonna<00:01:04.409> pick<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.799> your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
jump through you're gonna pick up your

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
jump through you're gonna pick up your
block<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> close<00:01:06.210> right

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
block and then it's going to close right

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
block and then it's going to close right
back<00:01:06.600> behind<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.710> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
back behind you because the way this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
back behind you because the way this
thing<00:01:07.920> works<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> actually<00:01:08.549> uses<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> wooden

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
thing works it actually uses a wooden

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.109 
thing works it actually uses a wooden
pressure<00:01:09.780> plate<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.950> wooden<00:01:11.430> trap<00:01:11.820> door

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pressure plate and a wooden trap door

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
pressure plate and a wooden trap door
and<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> how<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.229> lock<00:01:13.470> people<00:01:13.770> out

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and that is how you can lock people out

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
and that is how you can lock people out
so<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.330> simple<00:01:15.840> mechanism<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so that is a very simple mechanism and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
so that is a very simple mechanism and
if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.369> being<00:01:17.549> built<00:01:17.790> again

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
if you want to see one being built again

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.550 
if you want to see one being built again
it<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.869> simple<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.350> you're<00:01:19.470> going

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it is very very simple all you're going

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
it is very very simple all you're going
to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> wooden<00:01:20.939> pressure<00:01:21.180> plate<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to do is put a wooden pressure plate and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
to do is put a wooden pressure plate and
