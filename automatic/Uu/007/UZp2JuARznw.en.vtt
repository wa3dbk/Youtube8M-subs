00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.910 
welcome back to Linda's pantry we are
doing<00:00:10.300> a<00:00:10.480> review<00:00:10.840> and<00:00:11.080> I<00:00:11.170> wanted<00:00:11.500> to<00:00:11.559> do<00:00:11.740> this

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
doing a review and I wanted to do this

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.070 
doing a review and I wanted to do this
because<00:00:12.219> I<00:00:12.760> didn't<00:00:13.090> want<00:00:13.120> people<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:13.930> think

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
because I didn't want people to think

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.520 
because I didn't want people to think
after<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:14.709> can<00:00:15.010> this<00:00:15.309> ham<00:00:16.059> and<00:00:16.240> bean<00:00:16.390> soup<00:00:16.720> that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
after I can this ham and bean soup that

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.859 
after I can this ham and bean soup that
you<00:00:17.619> were<00:00:17.710> just<00:00:17.800> going<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.039> pour<00:00:18.310> it<00:00:18.460> out<00:00:18.670> and<00:00:19.660> I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
you were just going to pour it out and I

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.400 
you were just going to pour it out and I
didn't<00:00:20.199> really<00:00:20.230> explain<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:22.410> different

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
didn't really explain that different

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.260 
didn't really explain that different
beans<00:00:23.680> absorb<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.430> different<00:00:24.820> amount<00:00:25.030> of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
beans absorb a different amount of

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.770 
beans absorb a different amount of
moisture<00:00:25.450> I<00:00:25.960> noticed<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.650> pinto<00:00:27.160> beans

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
moisture I noticed that pinto beans

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.690 
moisture I noticed that pinto beans
absorb<00:00:28.780> more<00:00:28.960> moisture<00:00:29.560> than<00:00:29.590> let's<00:00:30.310> say<00:00:30.430> your

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
absorb more moisture than let's say your

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.939 
absorb more moisture than let's say your
kidney<00:00:31.000> beans<00:00:31.180> so<00:00:33.360> anyway<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:35.170> same<00:00:35.440> goes<00:00:35.649> for

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
kidney beans so anyway the same goes for

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.470 
kidney beans so anyway the same goes for
these<00:00:36.070> little<00:00:36.309> white<00:00:36.460> beans<00:00:36.699> they<00:00:36.910> actually

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
these little white beans they actually

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.470 
these little white beans they actually
almost<00:00:37.840> double<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.410> size<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.130> as<00:00:39.400> you<00:00:40.150> can<00:00:40.270> see

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
almost double in size so as you can see

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.740 
almost double in size so as you can see
the<00:00:40.630> viscosity<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.020> this<00:00:41.680> product<00:00:42.460> it's<00:00:42.970> kind

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
the viscosity of this product it's kind

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.889 
the viscosity of this product it's kind
of<00:00:43.840> like<00:00:44.310> what<00:00:45.310> you<00:00:45.460> would<00:00:45.550> get<00:00:46.000> if<00:00:46.060> you<00:00:46.360> open<00:00:46.750> a
