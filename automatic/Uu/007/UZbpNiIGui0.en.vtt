00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.220
 hot 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.760
 because they become more restless as well as they can present diseases to

 be exposed to heat 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.960

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 electrical has not been made 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.950
 the current does not support even the lighting of a cooling fan 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.970
 the classrooms 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.460

 commitment went further than when governing after a few minutes of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.719
