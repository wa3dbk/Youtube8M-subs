00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello girls and guys fans of 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.910
 monster street in this video I bring you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.069
 the last tutorial on how to do 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.400
 cleaning implements for your house 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.519
 show start for this first 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.010
 Implement you are going to occupy a jar I 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 I have the one that is saline solution but 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.180
 you can use the one you have at home 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 because then we have to the buckets 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.039
 plastic have different shapes and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.590
 varied sizes too and you are going to choose 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.990
 the tall guy who wants his toy and we're going 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.390
 to proceed to cut the cut with cutter 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.500
 and then it seems - with the scissors and now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.520
 let's make a cutting edge you need some 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.520
 some plastic lid I have this and I have 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 this is liquid cheese and what 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 you're going to do is get the edge of this 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.719
 shape with the help of the cutter you are going to make 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 a cut and it's going to get the edge and then 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.530
 Now let's proceed to paste it here to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.600
 edge of our bucket 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.329
 the plastic edge is already attached 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.890
 paste it use hot silicone 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.869
 now with the help of a cutter I throw 2 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.770
 holes on the sides to put the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.710
 handle and I'm going to take this wire that is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.159
 for crafts and then I'm going to arch 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.550
 helping him in the same container of 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.550
 sample 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 Now what I'm going to do is that with the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.900
 help of a round nose pliers 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.170
 these for crafts I'm going to bow 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.580
 the tips so they can enter here 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 thus 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.150
 now it's just a matter of putting 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.650
 in the hole and secure it with the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.690
 guitar 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.570
 the water bucket is already 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.340
 we already put the wire on it and that's 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.070
 everything about the bucket or bucket 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.620
 I wanted to show you also that the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 last video vacuum I forgot about 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.010
 tell you that you have to paint the rope 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.010
 black color and then that the wheels that 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.130
 I put here you can also replace them 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.060
 by buttons and now let's do the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.430
 next craft 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.580
 we are going to mark the container that we use 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.349
 the last time to make the dustpan 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.060
 Big let's mark the same way 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:29.090
 but this time we're going to leave you here a 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 ear I show you already cut this as 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.670
 you can observe with the scissors 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.430
 reduced the imperfections of gestha 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.819
 register that I will force the one that is 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.900
 double back and this is curve towards 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.880
 back I've also caught one of those 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.970
 circular sticks I cut a 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.970
 bit choose it so you do not have 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.310
 splinters and I'm going to stick it here 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.380
 I show 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.390
 that is the final result of the picker 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.760
 of hand you should stay like that the stick 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.290
 circular I stuck it with hot silicone 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.510
 and I painted it in black fitting it into a 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.380
 little ear that we left the bottle 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.030
 plastic 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.370
 is very similar to the one I have today in my 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.870
 house and that's it for the next 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.390
 object let's take one of these little cane 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.420
 only sorbets and we're going to use the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.910
 technique that you use to make the pasta 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.220
 dental for your monster high I show you 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.050
 what we are going to do is take a little 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.110
 hot silicone here and with the help of 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.680
 a flat object we will be pressure you 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.680
 I show how 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.080
 now that it is sealed what 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.930
 we are simply going to do is to choose the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.510
 size of our tube or paste for 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.510
 proceed to cut it and make the cap 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.250
 today we are going to wait for it to dry and 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.690
 we're just going to cut back now what 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.810
 The only thing we need to do is take a 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.060
 little bit of silicone here to cover the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.060
 tube and then it is totally closed 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.119
 I show you 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.210
 and that's it 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.880
 now let's dry it 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.520
 and with this we have combined all those 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.520
