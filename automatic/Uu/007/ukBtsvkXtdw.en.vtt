00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 good afternoon with you natalya popova and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.340
 project online biologist same last time we 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 They looked at you in common 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.080
 characteristic of the type of mollusks and today 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.170
 We proceed to review 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.900
 one of the classes that belong to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.600
 mollusk type is gastropods or 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 snails and treat it we will on 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.029
 one of the representatives of the class 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.489
 gastropods on the big river pond big 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.280
 prudovik lives in fresh standing 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.280
 ponds and the body of a large pond snail 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.460
 consists of the head of the legs and torso 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 torso big prada century concluded in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 a shell that can be in the form of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.829
 cap or spiral and body 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.489
 repeats the very form of this spiral or 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.480
 the cap sink is spirally twisted into 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.550
 45 curls and inside the body pond snail 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.800
 attached to this sink by 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.500
 muscles and with the help of these men 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.740
 pushing and sliding 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 heads and legs on a big head 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 prudovik located two tentacles it 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.650
 the organ of touch and at the base of these 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.840
 tentacles are located eyes 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.900
 the leg of a large pond snail is muscular and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.860
 has a sole and using the moon shaped 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.829
 movements prudovik moves eats 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.770
 large aquatic plants 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.930
 which he scrape with a float 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.320
 a grater is a cuticle of ars and teeth 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.110
 which are located in the pharynx of the pharynx 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.079
 food enters the esophagus and then goiter 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 where she swells gets wet and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.950
 preparing for further 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.590
 digestion and then food 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.229
 moves to the stomach to the stomach 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 digestive ducts open 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.920
 glands and liver after digestion 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.430
 enter the midgut the midgut 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.860
 makes a bend in the torso 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.020
 big pond century and then goes 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.580
 the back intestine which opens 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.129
 anus above head 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.560
 animal heart of the great parade of the century 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.540
 consists of two parts of the atria 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.260
 and ventricular circulatory system 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 an open type breathes a big pond snail 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.440
 light oxygenated blood 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.180
 from the lungs enters the atrium then 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.900
 ventricle and ventricle already through arteries 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.410
 distributed throughout the body 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.390
 big prudovik big prudovik it 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.500
 secondly aquatic animal that is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.110
 animal which 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.420
 from the match originally went to land and then 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.520
 returned to the aquatic environment and in order 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.200
 to breathe a big pro 2-ku 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.110
 need to rise to the surface 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.420
 water most of the time is big 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.180
 push on the bottom holds well for 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.310
 to breathe air he climbs on 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.590
 water surface and through the respiratory 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.380
 the hole which is located above 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.950
 head of the animal inhales the air after 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.530
 which brings the organs back to the bottom 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.900
 discharge from the great prada of the century is one 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.780
 kidney which is located next to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.460
 heart and light 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.280
 the nervous system of a large prudovik 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.100
 represented by nerve nodes which 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 located around the throat and these 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.360
 nerve nodes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.800
 go nerve trunks in all organs 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.170
 the great parade of the century hermaphrodite on i 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.330
 the reproductive system and its feature 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.860
 is that the big parade 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.870
 century there is one 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.000
 hermaphrodite on i sex gland 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.270
 which ripen and sperm and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.300
 ova fertilization in prada centuries 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.820
 internal cross development without 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.980
 metamorphosis that is from the egg immediately 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.500
 new ponds wiki come out with fine 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.780
 shells true century lay eggs in 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.690
 transparent mucous cords that 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.330
 attach to underwater plants except 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.420
 large gastropods or 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.180
 snails also applies ground 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.970
 animals such as fruit snail 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.340
 snail them since 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.430
 also have a spiral shaped sink 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.190
 or cap forms and which inhabit on 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.370
 land and so today we talked about 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.850
 gastropods or snails next 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.530
 time we will talk about the class 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.440
 bivalve both of these class refers 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.680
 to the type of mollusks with you was natalia 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.310
 popova and the project 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.310
 line by a is better
