00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.110
 Mr. Professor schneider what you need 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.460
 the people the people are in 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.250
 my eyes in principle only one 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.420
 good basic care especially in the 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.400
 Rural areas really have to stop 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 be guaranteed that a house place 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.890
 on-site doctor is nearby 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.929
 they often need my opinion 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.339
 less technology than the straight in 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.689
 Germany may be lived in 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:30.039
 the medical waltz more attention 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.869
 discussion together with the house also 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.869
 complex health complaints 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 holistic medicine is a bio 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.359
 psycho social model is one 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.519
 a attitude always approaching 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.030
 I think especially outside 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.469
 gets dr spirit of the household is therefore 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.969
 elementary we have just heard 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.269
 as far as theory goes for society 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.420
 How does the practice look like? 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.190
 family-centered care bayern the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.899
 GP-centered care in Bavaria 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.460
 has now recovered slowly we have 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.330
 once again contracts with all coffers 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.960
 closed and these contracts too 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.220
 Life 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.080
 however, the primary care is 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.300
 supply in bavaria of course what the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.399
 offspring is very much threatened 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.409
 and we have more 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.330
 make an effort that the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.840
 Young doctors use them for the dice 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.450
 to cut 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 Mr. Professor Schneider as the owner of 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.560
 chair for general medicine at the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.720
 Tu Munchen, you are virtually every day with 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
 how great the young are in contact 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.909
 the willingness of the junior family doctor 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.100
 to work yes not even as low as 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.450
 i find myself often rumored to be seated 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.330
 always do it yourself regularly 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.310
 events once a year 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.490
 How are you? 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.250
 settle 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.170
 even in rural areas and come here 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.729
 Last time there were 50 students 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.470
 a large part could be too 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.319
 imagine going to rural area 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.349
 So I think in principle certain reason 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.280
 there is a willingness to do that 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:01.179
 strong teaching institute at the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.890
 general medicine illegally would consist 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.750
 to motivate the students 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 but at the same time this is also necessary 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.429
 motivation motivation eels tension say 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.150
 I keep it that means too 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.480
 the study always 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.439
 to clarify with the young educate 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.590
 how does it continue? 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.299
 a bit lead by system one 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.709
 enable structured training 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.629
 but then comes the next one 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.920
 Step again as show how 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 let's settle down 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.700
 how can i do that with my individual 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.450
 arrange life planning how do I do 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.159
 that as a woman with children maybe but 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.560
 also how are young men with 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.750
 Families with children adequately in the system 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.870
 cleared up what is there for 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.650
 Models adjustment models 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.819
 Part time models there you have to now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.700
 to be inventive 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.489
 I think it is the whole 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.060
 complete package needed so to speak 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.709
 to inspire students 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.150
 to keep up-to-date training assistants and 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.900
 but then also to the branch 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.510
 motivate 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.250
 Mr. dr. professor has tailor 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.720
 reported that only a fraction of the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.409
 young medical graduate 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.030
 just go for it as a general practitioner earlier 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.739
 was that different there have the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.370
 general practitioners the great majority 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.840
 educated 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.579
 why is the willingness among the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 according to their opinion, to young medical professionals 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.650
 Low become household 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.810
 meter to let 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.400
 this is a unique structural problem 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.810
 the first one has already been addressed 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.849
 the missing chairs on the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.379
 university that is the topic 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.930
 general medicine her to the 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.269
 Universities insufficiently represented and 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.599
 areas emptied and in training 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.840
 also stated the other is that the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.709
 young general with young doctors 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.449
 of course completely different work 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.699
 conceptions have as the previous one 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:41.370
 household job 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.169
 the so-called single practice with around 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 The watch is not ready anymore 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.269
 what are you young people today 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.949
 strive for 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.739
 the young people are striving for one today 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.449
 work on intimate work with 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.639
 regulated times possibly in 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.650
 employment relationship and that is one 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.379
 burned a rethink, of course, too 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.680
 among the doctors themselves that we ourselves 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.480
 consider how we want 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.810
 make work more free in the future 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.459
 Let's continue as a single practice before 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.409
 We work or want to work ourselves 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.540
 maybe join together too small 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.980
 more general to family doctor centers 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.719
 so we will be back 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.549
 feminization of the solon feminization 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.840
 fair that means the women can also 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.440
 enter into general medicine the 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.630
 actually most beautiful form of medicine and 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.910
 can worry without economic worries 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.440
 bring in there and I believe that it 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.580
 a big task we will have in the future 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.180
 have to afford 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.009
 but we need it firmer 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.660
 basic conditions such as fixed 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.610
 fee conceptions 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.590
 family doctor contracts the family doctor must 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.039
 his position must also be secured 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.810
 to be implemented by the policy 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.030
 best of course we would get one 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.690
 The primary system must be every patient 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.380
 must intervene and then from him 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.699
 to be led 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.680
 The family doctor must have one 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.810
 he must take on the role of coordinator 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 not only me treating his us 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.360
 coordinator must plan for the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.000
 Patients need to be a patient through the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.590
 whole system of medicine suffer and that 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.510
 requires scary efforts 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.310
 They are very much fighting for GP contracts 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.360
 old right now has the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.830
 Bavarian state government 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.310
 funding program 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.599
 can not replace that no when 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.389
 best will not I'm glad that 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.159
 me this and the sponsorship program 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.479
 that can do one or the other 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.650
 others maybe in the one or the other 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:32.229
 others of the bavarian country lure 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.580
 But the funding program is only one 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.720
 Drop in the ocean 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.669
 we just have to do that 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.610
 the conditions that follow 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.590
 create and otherwise I have 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.020
 ever said this elsewhere 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.419
 to be as old said aimed at getting 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.580
 but have no soldiers subordinated to the 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.830
 politics would affect the family doctors 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.690
 against the economically well again and 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.919
 She would go back a few years 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.870
 stayed in, so to speak 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.729
 They would study medicine again 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.020
 decide to become household 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.180
 general medicine room 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.639
 yes in any case, just a great 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.710
 professional holistic broad range is 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.289
 never boring always happens every day 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.209
 again something new in the whole person 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.919
 view 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:15.610
 just fits my understanding 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.039
 on for medicine dr hostages are with me 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.409
 similar to 30 years in family medicine 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.689
 active and I have not planned before 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.719
 so would like to quit some years 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:28.360
 be active and I would be under new 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.849
 frame conditions again from the beginning 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.459
 start a home medical is exciting 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:36.099
 embracing them all the people 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:38.319
 accompany people and in new forms 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:40.209
 in the form of a team you can even 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.769
 Interested in understanding the final question 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.119
 if the good fairy i know and you 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:44.529
 had a wish for the free 

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.269
 general medicine what would they be 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:49.050
 I would wish for 

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:51.789
 of course, what else of the university 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.269
 Chair owner a well-equipped 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.979
 is institut institute in bavaria good 

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:58.599
 equipped so that you have the students 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.999
 sustainable by profession and the viruses 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.899
 but also with ours 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.949
 research activities to a good one 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:06.159
 development of family medicine 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:09.969
 can contribute and as relatively young 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:12.249
 kind of reliability, so to speak 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:14.139
 in the planning the politics 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:16.360
 would enable, so to speak, away from the 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.539
 constant changes structural changes 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.159
 health care more to one 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:23.589
 Sustainability also for the individual 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.569
 life planning of the worthy wish 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:29.369
 few defects under dr 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:31.749
 My wish is much shorter than 

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:33.669
 Occupational politician is in matters family doctor 

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:35.619
 I wish now finally the 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.659
 to regulate legal provisions so 

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:39.519
 It is regulated to get that we 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.959
 Doctors at eye level health insurance companies 

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:42.339
 can negotiate and thus the
