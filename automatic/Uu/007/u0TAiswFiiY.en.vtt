prom dance
I<00:00:36.480> used<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.200> design<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.860> own<00:00:37.890> dresses<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.760> have

I used to design my own dresses and have

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
I used to design my own dresses and have
them<00:00:39.570> made<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.160> therefore<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.670> had

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
them made and therefore you had

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.970 
them made and therefore you had
something<00:00:42.149> new<00:00:42.360> original<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.200> nobody<00:00:43.739> else

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
next step - I needed to find a pattern

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320 
next step - I needed to find a pattern

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
liked and so step three unfortunately I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670 
liked and so step three unfortunately I
can<00:01:41.640> still<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> pillowcase<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.409> can't

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

sew a dress I'm not that good yet so I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
sew a dress I'm not that good yet so I
actually<00:01:46.799> had<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> find<00:01:47.369> somebody<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.729> make<00:01:48.000> it
