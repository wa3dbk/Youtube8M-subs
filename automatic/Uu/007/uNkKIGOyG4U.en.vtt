you and give me my opinion on it um last

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.240 
you and give me my opinion on it um last
time<00:00:18.580> I<00:00:18.609> took<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:18.940> kayak<00:00:19.270> out<00:00:19.510> I<00:00:19.750> did<00:00:20.140> wash<00:00:21.010> it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
time I took the kayak out I did wash it

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.679 
time I took the kayak out I did wash it
really<00:00:21.580> well<00:00:21.699> and<00:00:22.029> I<00:00:22.119> sprayed<00:00:22.420> the<00:00:22.539> hose

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
really well and I sprayed the hose

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.000 
really well and I sprayed the hose
directly<00:00:23.109> on<00:00:23.230> there<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.529> it<00:00:23.590> did<00:00:23.710> get<00:00:23.830> some

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
directly on there and it did get some

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.300 
directly on there and it did get some
water<00:00:24.189> in<00:00:24.400> so<00:00:25.210> I'm<00:00:25.359> assuming<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.859> you<00:00:27.070> were<00:00:27.189> in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
water in so I'm assuming if you were in

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.279 
water in so I'm assuming if you were in
rough<00:00:27.609> waters<00:00:27.970> definitely<00:00:28.660> on<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.869> ocean<00:00:29.170> if

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
rough waters definitely on the ocean if

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.839 
rough waters definitely on the ocean if
you're<00:00:29.410> getting<00:00:29.650> spill<00:00:29.920> over<00:00:30.220> you'll

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
you're getting spill over you'll

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.389 
you're getting spill over you'll
probably<00:00:31.090> get<00:00:31.449> water<00:00:31.720> inside<00:00:31.929> your<00:00:32.140> hole<00:00:32.469> I'm

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
probably get water inside your hole I'm

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.770 
probably get water inside your hole I'm
sure<00:00:33.579> you<00:00:33.700> could<00:00:33.850> reseal<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.300> door<00:00:34.480> but<00:00:34.660> I'm

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
sure you could reseal the door but I'm

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
three foam blocks in here that I can

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.250 
three foam blocks in here that I can
tell<00:00:48.399> there's<00:00:48.760> one<00:00:49.120> towards<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.809> far<00:00:50.020> back

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
tell there's one towards the far back

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.549

maybe<00:00:51.090> four<00:00:52.090> or<00:00:52.120> five<00:00:52.360> inches<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.750> not<00:00:53.260> sure<00:00:53.440> if

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
maybe four or five inches in not sure if

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.500 
maybe four or five inches in not sure if
you<00:00:53.680> can<00:00:53.829> see<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.100> with<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.370> light<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.760> then

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
you can see that with the light and then

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.779 
you can see that with the light and then
there's<00:00:55.660> another<00:00:55.809> foam<00:00:56.170> block<00:00:56.410> here<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:57.670> can

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
there's another foam block here you can

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.069 
there's another foam block here you can
actually<00:00:57.940> remove<00:00:58.329> these<00:00:58.539> and<00:00:58.719> pull<00:00:58.840> them<00:00:58.989> out

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
actually remove these and pull them out

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.779 
actually remove these and pull them out
and<00:00:59.350> then<00:00:59.530> there's<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.739> third<00:00:59.980> foam<00:01:00.280> block<00:01:00.579> that

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
and then there's a third foam block that

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.200 
and then there's a third foam block that
goes<00:01:00.940> down<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.359> center<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.680> hole<00:01:03.089> so<00:01:04.089> if

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
goes down the center of the hole so if

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.490 
goes down the center of the hole so if
you<00:01:04.299> did<00:01:04.449> want<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.689> put<00:01:04.809> rods<00:01:05.019> in<00:01:05.199> here<00:01:05.379> I'm

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
you did want to put rods in here I'm

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.260 
you did want to put rods in here I'm
sure<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.830> could<00:01:05.979> remove<00:01:06.220> these<00:01:06.490> or<00:01:06.820> shift

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
sure you could remove these or shift

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.500 
sure you could remove these or shift
them<00:01:07.420> around<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:08.020> slide<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.770> rod<00:01:08.979> in<00:01:09.159> there

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
them around and slide a rod in there

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.000 
them around and slide a rod in there
obviously<00:01:10.510> if<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.200> start<00:01:11.439> moving<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.740> blocks

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
obviously if you start moving the blocks

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.380 
obviously if you start moving the blocks
around<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.430> may<00:01:12.580> take<00:01:12.790> away<00:01:13.060> from<00:01:13.270> the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
around that may take away from the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.420 
around that may take away from the
stability<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.960> standing<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.530> boat<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:15.100> I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
stability of standing on the boat so I

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.460 
stability of standing on the boat so I
don't<00:01:15.820> personally<00:01:16.150> plan<00:01:16.659> on<00:01:16.810> doing<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.259> I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
don't personally plan on doing that I

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.590 
don't personally plan on doing that I
can<00:01:18.310> find<00:01:18.520> plenty<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.820> rod<00:01:18.970> storage<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.450> my

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
can find plenty of rod storage on my

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.570 
can find plenty of rod storage on my
milk<00:01:19.900> crate<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.770> rod<00:01:21.130> holders<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.549> the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
milk crate and the rod holders in the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.749 
milk crate and the rod holders in the
back<00:01:22.770> I'll<00:01:23.770> show<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.100> measurements<00:01:24.549> to

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
back I'll show you the measurements to

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.890 
back I'll show you the measurements to
looks<00:01:25.420> like<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> cross<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:27.479> around<00:01:28.479> ten<00:01:28.750> and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
looks like a cross it is around ten and

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.730 
looks like a cross it is around ten and
three-eighths<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:31.020> wide<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.409> looks<00:01:32.590> like

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
three-eighths and wide it looks like

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.219 
three-eighths and wide it looks like
it's<00:01:32.860> about<00:01:32.979> six<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.400> half<00:01:34.229> another

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
it's about six and a half another

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.440 
it's about six and a half another
question<00:01:35.680> was<00:01:35.920> adding<00:01:36.340> or<00:01:36.759> putting<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:37.150> planer

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
question was adding or putting a planer

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.359 
question was adding or putting a planer
37-hundred<00:01:38.229> sized<00:01:38.380> box<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.920> which<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.220> have

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
37-hundred sized box in which I have

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.640 
37-hundred sized box in which I have
several<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.820> these<00:01:39.939> and<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:40.990> slides<00:01:41.259> directly

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
several of these and it slides directly
