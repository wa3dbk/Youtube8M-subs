something away from this DVD that you
can<00:01:11.440> implement<00:01:11.710> into<00:01:12.100> your<00:01:12.400> own<00:01:12.520> work<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.680> had<00:01:14.680> a

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.780 
email submitted asked or or told me
rather<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:22.920> were<00:01:23.920> told<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.520> know<00:01:24.640> to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
rather that they were told you know to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.639 
rather that they were told you know to
step<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.420> take<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> step<00:01:25.899> back<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.380> see

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
step it that take a step back and see

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.350 
step it that take a step back and see
what<00:01:26.680> they<00:01:26.950> were<00:01:27.009> doing<00:01:27.430> but<00:01:28.000> they<00:01:28.119> didn't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
what they were doing but they didn't

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.660 
what they were doing but they didn't
know<00:01:28.450> why<00:01:28.800> they<00:01:29.800> said<00:01:30.009> well<00:01:30.160> what<00:01:30.369> am<00:01:30.550> I

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
know why they said well what am I

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.150 
know why they said well what am I
looking<00:01:30.910> for<00:01:31.210> why<00:01:31.810> am<00:01:32.080> i<00:01:32.200> taking<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.710> step<00:01:32.890> back

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
looking for why am i taking a step back

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.980 
looking for why am i taking a step back
and<00:01:33.430> then<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.820> dawned<00:01:34.060> on<00:01:34.240> them<00:01:34.509> or<00:01:34.810> they<00:01:34.930> were

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
and then it dawned on them or they were

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.109 
and then it dawned on them or they were
told<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.820> check<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.970> values<00:01:37.649> see<00:01:38.649> how<00:01:39.119> your

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
told to check the values see how your

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.270 
told to check the values see how your
eye<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.390> drawn<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.410> that's<00:01:41.830> sort<00:01:42.190> of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
eye is drawn to that that's sort of

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
eye is drawn to that that's sort of
going<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.580> become<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.910> secondary<00:01:44.100> focal<00:01:45.100> point

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
going to become a secondary focal point

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.260 
going to become a secondary focal point
right<00:01:47.619> now<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.069> is<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.310> focal<00:01:48.880> point<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.209> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
right now it is the focal point in the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.410 
right now it is the focal point in the
first<00:01:49.539> area<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.050> your<00:01:50.259> eye<00:01:50.470> is<00:01:51.160> drawn<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:52.090> so

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
first area that your eye is drawn to so

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.680 
first area that your eye is drawn to so
that<00:01:52.660> will<00:01:52.929> help<00:01:53.080> maybe<00:01:53.350> explain<00:01:53.950> some<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
that will help maybe explain some of the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.559 
that will help maybe explain some of the
ideas<00:01:55.690> behind<00:01:56.459> center<00:01:57.459> of<00:01:57.550> interest<00:01:57.880> it's<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
ideas behind center of interest it's the

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.240 
ideas behind center of interest it's the
first<00:01:58.869> place<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.140> your<00:01:59.440> eye<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.590> drawn<00:02:00.009> to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
first place that your eye is drawn to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.820 
first place that your eye is drawn to
and<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.670> assess<00:02:01.060> which<00:02:01.360> will<00:02:01.600> be<00:02:01.830> like

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
and you can assess which will be like

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.820 
and you can assess which will be like
that<00:02:03.100> by<00:02:03.340> looking<00:02:03.700> at<00:02:03.789> your<00:02:03.940> subject<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.560> it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that by looking at your subject this it

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.010 
that by looking at your subject this it
will<00:02:06.039> change<00:02:06.340> because<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:07.000> will<00:02:07.300> obviously

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
will change because this will obviously

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.949 
will change because this will obviously
its<00:02:08.319> size<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.640> its<00:02:09.849> shape<00:02:11.430> will<00:02:12.430> draw<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:13.090> bit

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
its size and its shape will draw a bit

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.530 
its size and its shape will draw a bit
more<00:02:14.290> attention<00:02:14.740> but<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.310> will<00:02:15.490> secondly<00:02:16.060> or

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
more attention but this will secondly or

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.960 
more attention but this will secondly or
certainly<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:18.010> an<00:02:18.099> area<00:02:18.430> where<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:18.760> eye<00:02:18.790> is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
certainly be an area where your eye is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.320 
certainly be an area where your eye is
drawn<00:02:19.270> as<00:02:19.480> well<00:02:20.550> I'm<00:02:21.550> going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.030> draw<00:02:22.420> out<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
drawn as well I'm going to draw out the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.070 
drawn as well I'm going to draw out the
top<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.500> little<00:02:26.620> bit<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.810> check

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
top of this just a little bit and check

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.170 
top of this just a little bit and check
my<00:02:29.290> angles

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:47.750 

making<00:02:36.180> sure<00:02:36.209> everything<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:37.260> correct

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:01.550 

I<00:02:47.819> mean<00:02:48.569> into<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.989> side

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:12.530 

okay<00:03:03.569> getting<00:03:04.569> very<00:03:04.930> dark<00:03:05.379> here<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:08.099> here

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:37.399 

it's<00:03:13.540> actually<00:03:14.170> slightly<00:03:15.329> taller

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.229 

kind<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.640> putting<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.760> paint<00:03:39.909> on<00:03:40.060> there

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
kind of putting the paint on there

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.490 
kind of putting the paint on there
blending<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.909> into<00:03:42.909> the<00:03:43.180> background<00:03:43.840> wipe

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
blending it all into the background wipe

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:56.100 
blending it all into the background wipe
a<00:03:44.650> little<00:03:44.680> bit<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.159> that<00:03:45.280> off

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.890 

and<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.070> can<00:03:57.220> put<00:03:57.430> something<00:03:57.790> back<00:03:57.970> there<00:03:58.330> if

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
and we can put something back there if

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.259 
and we can put something back there if
we<00:03:59.170> want

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:16.279 

maybe<00:04:06.840> imply<00:04:08.900> there's<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:10.079> piece<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:11.010> corn<00:04:15.289> that

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
maybe imply there's a piece of corn that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:24.219 
maybe imply there's a piece of corn that
would<00:04:16.500> certainly<00:04:17.299> work

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:05:05.330 

thanks<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.319> lot<00:04:25.350> god<00:04:25.770> bless

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
