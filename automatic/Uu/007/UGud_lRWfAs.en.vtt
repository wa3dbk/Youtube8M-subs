00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.970
 hello youtube people but be well 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.040
 here I bring you a new video and I 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.189
 I bring the Google translate application 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.040
 or how to install this application of 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.990
 translator or whatever you want to call him good 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.050
 because you will need to download a 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 file for this I will leave you in the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.480
 description a link in which you 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.270
 will take to a blog where he wrote them 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.059
 it's written I explain how to download 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.430
 this file or these types of files 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.129
 so, well, once you have 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.510
 downloaded this file as they will have to 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.309
 come to your applications menu 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.570
 and look for the application that is called 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.250
 downloads that all android come 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.219
 with this application by default the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 we open then and when it opens we 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.439
 It will leave us good or it will appear 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.140
 of appearing a file like this one that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.570
 must say translator but in my case 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.810
 says script 1 because he already had another 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.869
 file but then to be able 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.509
 install it just press and we 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.060
 this will appear what would be the name of 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.289
 the application here things that nobody reads and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.729
 the options that would be cancel 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.560
 install good well let's give to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.770
 install and wait for the end of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.770
 installation 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.140
 well then when the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.880
 installation will leave us a screen 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.200
 similar to this what would be the name 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.660
 of application must appear 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.100
 installed application and if it appears 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.410
 installed application will show us the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.740
 options below which would be ready already 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.000
 open 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 well 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.229
 good that we have done this already 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.789
 we will have installed the application and the 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.649
 ready option would not go back to the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.629
 previous application that would be the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.190
 application of downloads and the option of 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.510
 open will take us directly to the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.840
 application to start 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.550
 use it but good here I'll show you 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.250
 something to delete this file since 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.980
 because they need to remove it because it takes 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.920
 space on your sd card and you are deleted 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.890
 forgive if you eliminate it you will not 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.569
 will uninstall and will not stop working 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.180
 application to the application will work 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.310
 normally even if you delete this file 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.080
 so I recommend that you delete it 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.650
 because occupy space in its version of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.640
 card which nobody wants so good 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.739
 only to eliminate what we leave 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.230
 pressed or palomi mas here in the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.790
 box and we give the trash can that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.769
 will appear here upstairs then 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 We on the boat and is ready now 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.780
 removed this file and it will not occupy 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.130
 space in the sdk well then in the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.640
 description I will also leave you a video 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.560
 as 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.750
 a review or how to use this 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.350
 application since good maybe some 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.020
 people do not know this application or 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.360
 maybe they want to see how it works and everything 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.790
 that's so good, I hope there will be 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.700
 liked this has been everything and if you have 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.700
