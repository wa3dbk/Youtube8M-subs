00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.190 
gently reattach the detached retina it's
especially<00:01:50.550> helpful<00:01:50.910> in<00:01:51.270> cases<00:01:51.479> such<00:01:51.660> as<00:01:51.870> this

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
especially helpful in cases such as this

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.430 
especially helpful in cases such as this
where<00:01:52.440> there's<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.740> giant<00:01:53.010> retinal<00:01:53.550> tear

where there's a giant retinal tear

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.410 
where there's a giant retinal tear
because<00:01:55.440> it<00:01:55.590> helps<00:01:55.860> stabilize<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.790> retina<00:01:57.240> as

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
because it helps stabilize the retina as

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.469 
because it helps stabilize the retina as
it<00:01:57.630> attaches<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.640> there<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:01:59.910> see<00:02:00.210> again

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it attaches it there you can see again
