how<00:00:05.910> about<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.330> song<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.259> words<00:00:07.560> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
how about the song is that the words and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.980 
how about the song is that the words and
the<00:00:08.040> translations<00:00:08.820> go<00:00:09.059> exactly<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the translations go exactly what the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.140 
the translations go exactly what the
movement<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> next<00:00:11.309> movement<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.849> going

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
movement so the next movement is going

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.530 
movement so the next movement is going
to<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.389> left<00:00:12.780> leg<00:00:13.280> oggy<00:00:14.280> oggy<00:00:14.639> which<00:00:15.240> means

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
yourself forward okay let me try that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.679 
yourself forward okay let me try that
again<00:01:07.799> putting<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> movement<00:01:08.850> together<00:01:09.119> it's

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
again putting the movement together it's

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.070 
again putting the movement together it's
left<00:01:10.049> leg<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.560> front<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.460> front<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.689> feet

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
left leg in front in front so the feet

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
left leg in front in front so the feet
are<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> switch<00:01:14.130> again<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> balance

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
are going to switch again the balance

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.320 
are going to switch again the balance
but<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.390> step<00:01:15.780> forward<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> forward<00:01:17.330> okay

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
but it's step forward and forward okay

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
but it's step forward and forward okay
so<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.720> left<00:01:18.960> foot<00:01:19.110> forward<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.159> right

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
so the left foot forward and the right

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
so the left foot forward and the right
foot<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.580> follows<00:01:21.470> now<00:01:22.470> doing<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
foot just follows now doing that with

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
foot just follows now doing that with
the<00:01:23.159> kitty<00:01:23.400> paws<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> kitty<00:01:24.570> paws<00:01:24.810> are

the kitty paws so the kitty paws are

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.810 
the kitty paws so the kitty paws are
your<00:01:25.200> nice<00:01:25.350> hands<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.159> you're<00:01:26.640> just

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
your nice hands here you're just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.719 
your nice hands here you're just
switching<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.930> risk<00:01:28.290> above<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> other<00:01:29.369> one

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
switching one risk above the other one

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
switching one risk above the other one
comes<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.420> comes<00:01:30.659> down<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.500> while<00:01:31.650> you're

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
doing that its forward forward okay so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.499 
doing that its forward forward okay so
you've<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:34.890> basic<00:01:35.640> step<00:01:35.880> you've<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.270> one

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you've got basic step you've got one

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
you've got basic step you've got one
