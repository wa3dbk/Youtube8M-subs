so<00:03:21.360> fast<00:03:21.960> too<00:03:22.500> now<00:03:23.160> as<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:24.630> walk<00:03:24.870> around<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.770> just

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
so fast too now as I walk around I just

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.180 
so fast too now as I walk around I just
want<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.730> tell<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.030> once<00:03:27.540> more<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.890> your

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
want to tell you once more that your

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.720 
want to tell you once more that your
ability<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.970> hear<00:03:30.210> where<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.600> am<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.490> walk

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
ability to hear where I am as I walk

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.900 
ability to hear where I am as I walk
around<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.240> room<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.780> simply<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.950> amazing

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
around the room is simply the amazing

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.210 
around the room is simply the amazing
power<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.570> your<00:03:37.140> brain<00:03:38.390> calculating<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.570> tiny

one has the digital algorithm that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.130 
one has the digital algorithm that

that<00:04:06.239> algorithm<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:08.010> called<00:04:09.560> set<00:04:10.560> Dara<00:04:13.100> but

that algorithm is called set Dara but
