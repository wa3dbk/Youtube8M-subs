00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
to tail with this and it's a good idea

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.070 
to tail with this and it's a good idea
you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.470> either<00:00:22.740> push<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.519> pull<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.510> file<00:00:24.810> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
you can either push or pull the file but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
you can either push or pull the file but
you<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:25.529> sure<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:26.460> tang<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.060> always

you want to make sure the tang is always

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
you want to make sure the tang is always
on<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.869> side<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> Steven<00:00:28.680> when<00:00:29.490> you're

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
on this side of the Steven when you're

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
on this side of the Steven when you're
pushing<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> right<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.590> you're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
pushing it on the right and you're

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.310 
pushing it on the right and you're
pulling<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> left<00:00:32.660> after<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.930> ski<00:00:34.200> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
pulling it on the left after the ski is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.010 
pulling it on the left after the ski is
flat<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.460> also<00:00:35.640> important<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> create

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
flat then it's also important to create

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
flat then it's also important to create
a<00:00:37.050> small<00:00:37.500> edge<00:00:37.770> bevel<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> use<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
a small edge bevel we're going to use a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.080 
a small edge bevel we're going to use a
bevel<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.950> edge<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.910> will

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
bevel on on the edge here that will

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.160 
bevel on on the edge here that will
create<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:43.379> base<00:00:43.950> babble<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.510> base<00:00:45.750> isn't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
create a base babble so the base isn't

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
create a base babble so the base isn't
perfectly<00:00:46.829> flat<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:47.700> beveled

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
perfectly flat it's actually beveled

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
perfectly flat it's actually beveled
right<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> edge<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.530> makes<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> ski

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
right at the edge this makes the ski

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:04.360 
right at the edge this makes the ski
easier<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> ski<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> works<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.949> this

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.500 

after<00:01:05.370> you're<00:01:05.520> sure<00:01:05.730> your<00:01:05.940> edge<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.270> beveled

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
after you're sure your edge is beveled

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.610 
after you're sure your edge is beveled
then<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.620> to<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.980> burrs<00:01:08.160> off<00:01:09.620> with

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
then you want to take the burrs off with

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.220 
then you want to take the burrs off with
your<00:01:10.800> diamond<00:01:11.160> stone<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:12.210> stone<00:01:12.570> happens<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
your diamond stone this stone happens to

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.350 
your diamond stone this stone happens to
be<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.950> 92<00:01:14.490> degree<00:01:14.760> edge<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.210> it's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
be set up with a 92 degree edge so it's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.080 
be set up with a 92 degree edge so it's
a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.660> more<00:01:15.900> acute<00:01:16.350> than<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.590> 90<00:01:16.950> degree

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
a little bit more acute than a 90 degree

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.080 
a little bit more acute than a 90 degree
and<00:01:18.090> again<00:01:18.390> working<00:01:18.630> tip<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.230> tail<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:20.090> run

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and again working tip to tail you run

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.360 
and again working tip to tail you run
the<00:01:21.840> diamond<00:01:22.050> stone<00:01:22.440> along<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> edge<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
the diamond stone along the edge and

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.390 
the diamond stone along the edge and
remove<00:01:24.120> those<00:01:24.300> burgers<00:01:24.890> take<00:01:25.890> down<00:01:26.160> both

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
remove those burgers take down both

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.220 
remove those burgers take down both
sides<00:01:28.070> go<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> forth<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.230> the

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
sides go back and forth a little bit the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.940 
sides go back and forth a little bit the
predominantly<00:01:31.860> tip<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> tail<00:01:33.620> then<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.800> finish

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
predominantly tip to tail then to finish

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
predominantly tip to tail then to finish
the<00:01:35.220> job<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.150> what's<00:01:36.390> called<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.690> gummy

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the job you use what's called a gummy

the job you use what's called a gummy
stone<00:01:37.229> stone<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> misnomer

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
stone stone is a bit of a misnomer

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
stone stone is a bit of a misnomer
because<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> compound<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
because it's more of a compound it's a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.830 
because it's more of a compound it's a
