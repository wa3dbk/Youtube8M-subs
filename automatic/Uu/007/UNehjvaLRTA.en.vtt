bin<00:01:43.439> holders<00:01:43.860> which<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.030> worked<00:01:45.299> would

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
bin holders which if they worked would

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.350 
bin holders which if they worked would
be<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.899> useful<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.220> since<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.060> can't

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
be really useful but since you can't

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.060 
be really useful but since you can't
trust<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> hold<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.619> extra<00:01:49.979> bits

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
trust them to hold your extra bits

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
trust them to hold your extra bits
they're<00:01:53.070> pretty<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:54.000> constant

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
they're pretty much just a constant

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
they're pretty much just a constant
reminder<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:56.810> Bosch<00:01:57.810> made<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> drill<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.890> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
slight design flaw but I would recommend

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.169 
slight design flaw but I would recommend
