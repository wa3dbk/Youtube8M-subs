00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.000
 yes 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.329
 operation of a three-phase motor with 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 speed and frequency control and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.200
 Later we will verify the control 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.130
 of the dynamic brake 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.930
 first we descend 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.930
 the system feeding the whole system 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.420
 we must wait for a prudent time 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.070
 we can verify that the bridge 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.850
 three-phase is giving us a voltage 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.960
 approximately 320 volt continuous 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.120
 after that we started the movement 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.830
 of the motor and fast 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.870
 to verify that by having a change of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.310
 often we will have a change of 20 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.310
 voltage which should be 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.710
 all right 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.259
 let's start this second part of 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.999
 our from the verification of our 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.819
 project in this video in which 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:44.460
 we conclude the whole process that we have 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.920
 made in the course of these days 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.390
 we have to check the relationship of b 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.409
 about constant f we have put a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.409
 frequency of 30 exercises 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.630
 in it or if we verify that it is the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.299
 same precisely the ppc that we place 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.180
 in the program is the frequency that 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.730
 we have in the signal is wm 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.910
 that is feeding the motor of 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.710
 three-phase induction 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.760
 we also see that the voltage is 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.230
 approximately one hundred between 110 and 120 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.880
 volts what are we having a 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.300
 true a relationship should about efe 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.300
 approximately 4 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.380
 we tell you this value to locate us in 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.540
 nothing relation 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.700
 we know that in the study he tells us that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.900
 we need a constant frequency 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.560
 it must be f for the circuit to be 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.959
 hold with a torque compensation 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.260
 now we are placing 44 exercises 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:55.580
 approximately 40 exercises as we saw 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:00.019
 we saw ourselves in the multimeter we have more 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.920
 of 160 volts that affirm what what 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.830
 we want to indicate 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.920
 finally we will place with ranges a 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.550
 frequency of 60 exercises what we 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.550
 I should give 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.189
 between about 220 and 240 volts 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.430
 precisely here we have the voltage 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:25.159
 varies a bit since the measurement does not 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.250
 is not accurate in the course of 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:32.079
 time likewise the frequency is a bit 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.079
 low we have 55 exercises 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.840
 however we see what 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.630
 it is a constant that at least 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.630
 keeps for for laboratory uses 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.590
 then we will perform the pri no 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.110
 dynamic we have a connected motor 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.470
 fed continuously imported the 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.510
 which moves at a constant speed 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.150
 which will be final through 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.519
 our investor at the time that 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.170
 performs the brake there is a generation 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.110
 of voltage in which the shock must be 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.220
 and it can be verified through the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.220
 photos and on it 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.009
 increases the voltage starts to generate 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.869
 a voltage in the motor 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.869
 which has got spoiled stopping 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.090
 but 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.710
 we also have the simulation of a 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 manual braking 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.310
 which performs the same phenomenon of 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.310
 generation of boltaÃ±a 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.440
 and we can achieve it in the luminaries 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.429
 the procedure that performs mind 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:34.189
 simulates the to achieve it in an engine 

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:34.189
 same car with motor shaft
