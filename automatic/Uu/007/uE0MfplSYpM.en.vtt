pounds<00:01:58.930> this<00:01:59.259> morning<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.740> freaked<00:02:00.039> out<00:02:00.159> with

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759

joy so I don't know

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.110 
joy so I don't know
well<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.310> think<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.640> was<00:02:04.700> good<00:02:04.940> because

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
well I think it was good because

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.499 
well I think it was good because
psychologically<00:02:05.630> jenny<00:02:06.380> was<00:02:06.590> really

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
psychologically jenny was really

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.820 
psychologically jenny was really
bothered<00:02:08.509> by<00:02:08.540> not<00:02:08.840> having<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.500> comfort

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
bothered by not having that comfort

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.350 
bothered by not having that comfort
blanket<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.430> being<00:02:10.640> able<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.850> go<00:02:10.970> check<00:02:11.210> how

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
blanket of being able to go check how

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.160 
blanket of being able to go check how
she<00:02:11.420> was<00:02:11.660> doing

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
she was doing

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.760 
she was doing
but<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:13.970> very<00:02:14.390> telling<00:02:15.290> when<00:02:15.470> she

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
but I think it was very telling when she

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.340 
but I think it was very telling when she
got<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> scale<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.570> know<00:02:17.690> her

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
got on the scale that you know her

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.110 
got on the scale that you know her
mindset<00:02:18.890> may<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.250> been<00:02:19.370> pushing<00:02:19.640> harder<00:02:19.970> who

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
mindset may have been pushing harder who

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.020 
mindset may have been pushing harder who
knows<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.630> mean<00:02:20.780> one<00:02:21.140> way<00:02:21.290> or<00:02:21.440> another<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.910> is

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
knows I mean one way or another this is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.190 
knows I mean one way or another this is
the<00:02:23.120> most<00:02:23.300> amount<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:23.690> weight<00:02:23.810> she's<00:02:24.020> also

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the most amount of weight she's also

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.670 
the most amount of weight she's also
two-week<00:02:24.650> span<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.660> think<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.170> helped<00:02:27.470> for

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
two-week span so I think it helped for

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.070 
two-week span so I think it helped for
sure<00:02:28.190> okay<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.240> Jane's<00:02:29.450> just<00:02:29.720> finished

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
sure okay so the Jane's just finished

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
their week six wane and measurements

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.570 
their week six wane and measurements
they<00:02:31.940> did<00:02:32.120> great<00:02:32.680> very<00:02:33.680> proud<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.190> both<00:02:34.340> of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
they did great very proud of both of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.360 
they did great very proud of both of
them<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:35.050> think<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.440> fact<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> took<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
them I think the fact that I took the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.280 
them I think the fact that I took the
scale<00:02:37.640> away<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.240> during<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.690> two-week<00:02:38.959> so

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
scale away and during this two-week so

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.630 
scale away and during this two-week so
they<00:02:39.410> couldn't<00:02:39.650> check<00:02:40.160> their<00:02:40.400> weight<00:02:40.610> every

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
they couldn't check their weight every

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.730 
they couldn't check their weight every
day<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:42.110> made<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.709> difference

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
day I think made the difference

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.670 
day I think made the difference
obviously<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.420> know<00:02:44.510> eating<00:02:45.140> healthy<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
obviously you know eating healthy and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.130 
obviously you know eating healthy and
exercising<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:46.550> also<00:02:46.730> played<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> factor<00:02:47.750> so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
exercising I also played a factor so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.990 
exercising I also played a factor so
