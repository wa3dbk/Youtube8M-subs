00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.210 
early intermediate music of equal
interest<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:28.990> there's<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.650> challenge<00:04:29.919> in

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
interest so there's a challenge in

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.860 
interest so there's a challenge in
finding<00:04:30.430> music<00:04:30.729> that's<00:04:31.120> at<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.330> right<00:04:31.479> level

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
finding music that's at the right level

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.409 
finding music that's at the right level
but<00:04:32.530> another<00:04:33.040> element<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.699> puzzle<00:04:34.030> for<00:04:34.060> me

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
but another element of the puzzle for me

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.850 
but another element of the puzzle for me
is<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:35.550> avoid<00:04:36.550> having<00:04:37.270> several<00:04:38.229> students<00:04:38.740> in

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
is to avoid having several students in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.409 
is to avoid having several students in
the<00:04:38.919> studio<00:04:39.220> playing<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.669> same<00:04:39.880> words<00:04:40.090> I

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
the studio playing the same words I

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.930 
the studio playing the same words I
don't<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.139> hearing<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:42.070> same<00:04:42.250> pieces<00:04:42.520> over

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
don't like hearing the same pieces over

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.820 
don't like hearing the same pieces over
and<00:04:43.090> over<00:04:43.150> again<00:04:43.360> during<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.960> same<00:04:44.199> say

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
and over again during the same say

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.050 
and over again during the same say
period<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.520> years<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:46.120> prefer<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:47.790> avoid<00:04:48.790> that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
period of years I prefer to avoid that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.629 
period of years I prefer to avoid that
this<00:04:50.160> prevents<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> sense<00:04:51.520> of

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
this prevents the sense of

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.570 
this prevents the sense of
competitiveness<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.630> studio<00:04:52.960> in<00:04:53.490> here<00:04:54.490> in

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
competitiveness in the studio in here in

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.490 
competitiveness in the studio in here in
two<00:04:54.729> different<00:04:55.080> interpretations<00:04:56.080> but<00:04:56.530> also

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
two different interpretations but also

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.719 
two different interpretations but also
helps<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.650> students<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.160> become<00:05:00.310> better

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
helps the students to become better

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.909 
helps the students to become better
aware<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.690> range<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.139> repertoire<00:05:02.710> out

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
aware of the range of repertoire out

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.070 
aware of the range of repertoire out
there<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.520> keeps<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.479> more<00:05:04.630> interesting<00:05:04.870> for

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
there and keeps it more interesting for

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.560 
there and keeps it more interesting for
me<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:06.310> have<00:05:06.430> any<00:05:06.580> standards<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:07.419> make

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
me to have any standards that you make

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.340 
me to have any standards that you make
students<00:05:07.930> play<00:05:08.970> not<00:05:09.970> really<00:05:10.419> I<00:05:10.449> try<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.110> avoid

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
students play not really I try to avoid

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.969 
students play not really I try to avoid
that<00:05:11.560> whole<00:05:11.979> idea<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.490> teaching<00:05:13.979> certain

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
that whole idea of teaching certain

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.010 
that whole idea of teaching certain
standards<00:05:15.580> all<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.880> time<00:05:16.060> I<00:05:16.090> mean<00:05:16.360> there<00:05:16.750> are

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
standards all the time I mean there are

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.290 
standards all the time I mean there are
war<00:05:17.740> horses<00:05:18.100> at<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.370> repertoire<00:05:18.940> which<00:05:19.090> get
