00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:13.889
 hey people today are a short oriented 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.599
 tip video divided into five points 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.439
 how to easily get high scores freaks 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.249
 can reach as it may be so one 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.230
 whole stuff so only 101 5 points 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.570
 on 11 am can be with the first one on 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.310
 a real motivating my fashion where 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.789
 I can most easily achieve it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.730
 domination and position you should be so 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.100
 motives where you have at least 100 per key 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.379
 that does not get a fifty-two point 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 how is conclusion confirm that is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.370
 not really that scary high 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 reach unless one collected brands 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.719
 then it is good if you have the tips 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 succeeded the mode is not so good 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.660
 conclusion I would confirm 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 recommend domination transfer 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.379
 domination knows so long so attitude 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.410
 Wellmann presentation when you paid 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.870
 points and 150 runners one 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 graduation on farewell exhibition 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 our worries 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.820
 you just get more profile 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.790
 second point is equal to important perks 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.220
 choose and throw that is philip rizk 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.470
 recommend geis transition unlocked 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 you just get so transparent 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 transparent on the card is appears 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.300
 the clubs do not find you on the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 card today and so you can do a lot 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.740
 heavy fell should his arms the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 for him, only good is I would 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.810
 M8 recommend it well 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 a storm rifle or smt because of sharp 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.790
 and lg are not that good 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.710
 lmg ten affair distance well and fit 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.660
 away after close of the dance, it is 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 so if only the dance corps 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.030
 should be able to shoot him then 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.720
 the third point is the third point 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.700
 a certain area dominate so 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 if you are now up and to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.690
 example, three inputs are and can be 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 dominate if you have for example 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.260
 a good overview on the field down 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.690
 again fast map is available on both 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.580
 the top of the building must be a red one 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.910
 This may also be the case on the floor 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.980
 always in the middle and left next to it 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.259
 on one side is the field 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.450
 Speedball fields drive when the top 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.180
 area there is great to hold 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.500
 the point to hold I then shows 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390
 not glare-free kilometers or so 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.310
 watch 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.019
 and yes the area is great for holding 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.370
 Just keep a certain range of it 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.140
 understands what I mean not running around 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.569
 there with a certain area where 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.500
 many opponents run past 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.720
 I also have to be pretty sure 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.310
 can protect run along it can not 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.670
 a small gang is locked up only 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.410
 can run away from grenades and stuff like that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.060
 I'm sure that submission is safe 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.040
 feels where you can play well only for 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 so again a high position 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.569
 looking with a shotgun for 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.599
 example but adjust unlock 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.160
 the fourth point is risk nothing 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.890
 So do not run in now so think 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.780
 is an enemy now running down there 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.110
 think you've sure he's jumping down 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.120
 times 10 times components so nothing 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.980
 do not risk this as off opponents 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.230
 jump ghosts always wait and see 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.880
 see if everything fits 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.380
 coming from a safe position and 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.630
 she does not know that he will 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.829
 not doing anything now and then 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.069
 later at home 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:19.319
 that thinks it is so easy 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:22.440
 not so presently judge 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.060
 choose right tricks as right 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.950
 I can combine sexism 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.940
 for example watch enthusiastic song and emp 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.950
 Although enthusiastic song and emp has then 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.329
 you have almost certainly state form 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.910
 So connect you click through 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.400
 drone something point profile of yours 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.989
 the controller too and that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.329
 suddenly points to the next 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.280
 scores tricky and if they are really high 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.769
 will reach then I would recommend 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.959
 maybe if you often drone at the beginning 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.329
 or enthusiastic invites us when it was 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.920
 do not have that 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.780
 So he stands firm instead of two years 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.720
 perhaps relish or something it could 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.150
 really easy to reach 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.600
 quite enough really high scores off 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.520
 very simply somehow I have the 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.030
 why do I have it? 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.700
 almost by itself and through the tips can 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.020
 Just give them where it poured tricks 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.480
 use yes horrible stop I have 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.329
 not at that time horst rix war was there 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.230
 you at most loudly internet 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.610
 I reach what I do twice a day 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.890
 achieved if I want to venture very much 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.690
 just in any case thanks for 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.580
 to see and if you liked it 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.220
 then the video will suffer and if she likes her 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.020
 more sure the videos wanted to create 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.370
 maybe in the comments a video 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.620
 which she wanted to have it was 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.900
 maybe tips and subscribe for more 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.470
 again increased videos and thanks for that 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.470
 are z
