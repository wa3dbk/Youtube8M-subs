the key to origami so yeah so pull like

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.639 
the key to origami so yeah so pull like
that<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.289> full<00:00:46.670> then<00:00:47.670> fold<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.870> side<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that then full then fold this side to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
that then full then fold this side to
this<00:00:49.829> side<00:00:54.110> like<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:59.000> okay

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
this side like so okay

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.380 
this side like so okay
now<00:01:00.620> unfold<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:02.969> we'll<00:01:03.149> take<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
now unfold this and now we'll take a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.340 
now unfold this and now we'll take a
pacman<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> side<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> opens<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:07.080> like

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
pacman so the side that opens up like

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.240 
pacman so the side that opens up like
that<00:01:07.530> once<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.250> then

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that once it go down there is that then

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.510 
that once it go down there is that then
take<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.060> flap<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.380> fold<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.920> towards

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
take this flap here and fold it towards

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.570 
take this flap here and fold it towards
the<00:01:14.549> middle<00:01:14.640> crease<00:01:20.479> like<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:23.310> seem

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the middle crease like that then do seem

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:34.530 
the middle crease like that then do seem
to<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.880> side<00:01:24.119> fold<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.730 

okay<00:01:35.540> then<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:37.100> won't<00:01:37.759> take<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.149> flap<00:01:38.450> here

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
okay then you won't take this flap here

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.200 
okay then you won't take this flap here
just<00:01:39.740> open<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.189> up<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:40.549> a<00:01:40.610> little<00:01:40.939> bit<00:01:41.060> like

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
just open it up like a little bit like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.740 
just open it up like a little bit like
that<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.780> then<00:01:42.939> we<00:01:43.939> may<00:01:44.149> need<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.450> put<00:01:44.600> your

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
finger in it like that and push it down

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.179 
finger in it like that and push it down
like<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:49.220> like<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.799> looks<00:01:52.039> like

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
like that like so so that it looks like

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.620 
like that like so so that it looks like
a<00:01:52.220> house<00:01:53.439> kind<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:55.720> like<00:01:57.250> like<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.460> okay

it up like that and that's pushed down

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.149 
it up like that and that's pushed down
now<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:05.929> wanna<00:02:06.140> do<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.350> same<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.920> side

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
now you wanna do the same to this side

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.749 
now you wanna do the same to this side
you<00:02:08.119> want<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.390> open<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.039> push<00:02:10.580> it

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
right easy so now we're one step closer

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.780 
right easy so now we're one step closer
to<00:02:26.180> making<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.630> piano<00:02:26.959> from<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.549> take

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
to making the piano from here just take

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.900 
to making the piano from here just take
this<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.510> fold<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.350> way<00:02:30.560> up<00:02:31.660> okay<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
this and fold it all the way up okay and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.810 
this and fold it all the way up okay and
now<00:02:35.150> you've<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:36.220> just<00:02:37.220> take<00:02:37.430> them<00:02:37.579> and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
now you've got this just take them and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.940 
now you've got this just take them and
then<00:02:38.090> from<00:02:38.390> there<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.690> take<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> little<00:02:39.620> bit

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
then from there just take a little bit

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.099 
then from there just take a little bit
of<00:02:40.130> part<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:40.970> like<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.510> much<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.930> guess

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
of part of this like this much I guess

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.840 
of part of this like this much I guess
and<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.769> fold<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.250> down<00:02:43.690> okay
