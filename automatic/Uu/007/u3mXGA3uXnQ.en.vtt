00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
okay this is ace invaders on the Jupiter

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay this is ace invaders on the Jupiter
ace<00:00:04.799> my<00:00:05.700> apologies<00:00:06.210> for<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> flickering

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899

ace my apologies for the flickering
flashing<00:00:07.589> whatever<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.290> don't<00:00:10.290> think

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
flashing whatever that I don't think

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.860 
flashing whatever that I don't think
it's<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.679> fault<00:00:10.950> with<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.429> Duke<00:00:11.700> trace<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.330> think

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
it's a fault with the Duke trace I think

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.340 
it's a fault with the Duke trace I think
it's<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.530> TV<00:00:14.009> doesn't<00:00:14.340> like<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:15.350> because

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it's just my TV doesn't like it because

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.980 
it's just my TV doesn't like it because
I'm<00:00:16.529> running<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> big<00:00:17.039> LCD<00:00:17.359> TV<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.539> did<00:00:18.810> run

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
I'm running on a big LCD TV I did run

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.099 
I'm running on a big LCD TV I did run
this<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.590> cathode<00:00:19.949> ray<00:00:20.160> tube

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
this on the little cathode ray tube

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.160 
this on the little cathode ray tube
earlier<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:22.650> absolutely<00:00:22.800> fine<00:00:24.170> so

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
earlier and it was absolutely fine so

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.150 
earlier and it was absolutely fine so
it's<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.340> daddy<00:00:26.609> doesn't<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.029> it

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
it's just this daddy doesn't like it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.990 
it's just this daddy doesn't like it
anyway<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.900> 1k<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.980> 3k<00:00:32.550> depending

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
anyway this is like a 1k or 3k depending

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
anyway this is like a 1k or 3k depending
how<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.149> look<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.430> one

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
how you look at it game the first one

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
how you look at it game the first one
I've<00:00:35.760> loaded<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:39.020> obviously<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> clone<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
I've loaded in this obviously a clone of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.430 
I've loaded in this obviously a clone of
space<00:00:40.800> invaders<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:48.030> quite

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
space invaders and it's quite

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.850 
space invaders and it's quite
novel

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.390 

I<00:00:55.300> mean<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.480> is

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
I mean it is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.730 
I mean it is
I<00:00:58.960> don't<00:00:59.960> know<00:01:00.050> if<00:01:00.110> you<00:01:00.200> can<00:01:00.290> hear<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.590> sound

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
I don't know if you can hear the sound

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.500 
I don't know if you can hear the sound
because<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:01.130> very<00:01:01.400> very<00:01:01.760> quiet<00:01:01.970> is<00:01:02.210> coming

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
because it's very very quiet is coming

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.210 
because it's very very quiet is coming
from<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.690> little<00:01:02.900> internal<00:01:03.230> speaker<00:01:06.220> it's

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
from a little internal speaker it's

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.580 
from a little internal speaker it's
clearly<00:01:07.610> graphically<00:01:08.480> superior<00:01:09.080> doors<00:01:09.320> EDX

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
clearly graphically superior doors EDX

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.870 
clearly graphically superior doors EDX
81<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.650> about<00:01:12.860> all<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.100> can<00:01:13.220> say<00:01:13.580> about<00:01:13.610> it

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
81 that is about all I can say about it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:29.130 
81 that is about all I can say about it
really

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.020 

I<00:01:29.200> do<00:01:29.740> wonder<00:01:30.040> if<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.400> flashing<00:01:30.909> is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
I do wonder if that flashing is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.120 
I do wonder if that flashing is
something<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.600> do<00:01:31.780> with<00:01:31.990> interference<00:01:32.950> from

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
something to do with interference from

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.930 
something to do with interference from
the<00:01:33.190> cpe<00:01:33.670> or<00:01:34.740> I've<00:01:35.740> now<00:01:35.979> something<00:01:36.370> like<00:01:36.550> clock

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
the cpe or I've now something like clock

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.520 
the cpe or I've now something like clock
cycle<00:01:37.479> or<00:01:37.570> whatever<00:01:37.840> because<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.200> seems<00:01:38.409> to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
cycle or whatever because it seems to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.180 
cycle or whatever because it seems to
coincide<00:01:38.650> with<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:43.500> general<00:01:44.500> cycling<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
coincide with the general cycling of the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.830 
coincide with the general cycling of the
program<00:01:45.640> maybe<00:01:46.240> not<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.100> said<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.670> didn't<00:01:49.660> do

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
program maybe not as I said it didn't do

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.780 
program maybe not as I said it didn't do
that<00:01:50.080> on<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.880> cathode<00:01:52.360> ray<00:01:52.540> tube<00:01:53.790> but

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
that on the little cathode ray tube but

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.760 
that on the little cathode ray tube but
of<00:01:54.880> course<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.119> cannot<00:01:55.360> video<00:01:55.690> cathode<00:01:56.590> ray

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
of course you cannot video cathode ray

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.050 
of course you cannot video cathode ray
tubes<00:01:57.040> without<00:01:57.220> getting<00:01:57.670> even<00:01:57.909> worse

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
tubes without getting even worse

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.040 
tubes without getting even worse
flickering<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:58.659> flashing<00:01:59.110> than<00:01:59.259> this<00:02:00.720> as<00:02:01.720> for

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
flickering and flashing than this as for

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.389 
flickering and flashing than this as for
the<00:02:02.110> game<00:02:02.320> well<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.680> most<00:02:05.860> peculiar

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
the game well it's the most peculiar

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.060 
the game well it's the most peculiar
space<00:02:06.700> invaders<00:02:07.210> I've<00:02:07.360> ever<00:02:07.660> seen<00:02:07.869> because

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.310 

rather<00:02:12.070> than<00:02:12.540> turning<00:02:13.540> around<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.930> going<00:02:14.019> the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
rather than turning around and going the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.630 
rather than turning around and going the
other<00:02:14.350> way<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:14.830> they<00:02:14.980> reach<00:02:15.130> gender<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
other way when they reach gender the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.020 
other way when they reach gender the
screen<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:17.560> come<00:02:17.800> back<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> other<00:02:18.370> side

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.780 

actually<00:02:22.030> makes<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> more<00:02:22.660> difficult

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.039 

oh<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:27.909> died

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:42.430 

yeah<00:02:32.049> that's<00:02:32.319> definitely<00:02:32.560> unusual

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.400 

let's<00:02:42.890> see<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.490> can<00:02:43.730> apparently<00:02:44.230> change<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
let's see you can apparently change the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.610 
let's see you can apparently change the
speed<00:02:46.900> fast

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
speed fast

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:05.380 
speed fast
run<00:02:50.810> let's<00:02:51.810> see<00:02:52.049> what<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.349> does<00:02:52.620> oh<00:02:54.019> yeah

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.809 

I<00:03:05.450> am<00:03:06.080> limited<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.890> games<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.460> run<00:03:07.640> on

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
I am limited to the games I can run on

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.170 
I am limited to the games I can run on
here<00:03:08.260> as<00:03:09.260> though<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.470> found<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.950> site<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.550> has

here as though I found a site that has

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.490 
here as though I found a site that has
got<00:03:12.100> downloadable<00:03:13.100> wav<00:03:13.280> files<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.260> games
