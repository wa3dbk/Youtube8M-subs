00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.760 
easier and quicker than scrolling
through<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> bunch<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> pages<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:37.350> actually

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
through a bunch of pages to actually

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.260 
through a bunch of pages to actually
vertically<00:01:38.280> scroll<00:01:38.640> through<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
vertically scroll through so that's a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.340 
vertically scroll through so that's a
personal<00:01:39.570> opinion<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.990> mine<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> actually

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
personal opinion of mine I actually

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
personal opinion of mine I actually
prefer<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.579> also<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> go

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
prefer it and then also when you go

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.260 
prefer it and then also when you go
ahead<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> select<00:01:42.810> widgets<00:01:43.700> you'll<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:45.030> it's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
ahead and select widgets you'll see it's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.330 
ahead and select widgets you'll see it's
a<00:01:45.420> vertical<00:01:45.899> scrolling<00:01:46.350> option<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
a vertical scrolling option as well and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
a vertical scrolling option as well and
then<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.700> multiple<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:48.570> than<00:01:48.750> two

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
then if you have multiple more than two

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.350 
then if you have multiple more than two
you<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.649> horizontal<00:01:50.640> scrolling<00:01:50.970> between

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you have horizontal scrolling between

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.910 
you have horizontal scrolling between
those<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:51.930> prefer<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.680> well

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
those and I actually prefer this as well

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859 
those and I actually prefer this as well
so<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.149> personal<00:01:54.329> opinion<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so that's just a personal opinion I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.330 
so that's just a personal opinion I
actually<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.439> having<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> vertical

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
actually like having the vertical

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.469 
actually like having the vertical
scrolling<00:01:56.640> within<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.000> app<00:01:57.090> tray<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
scrolling within the app tray of a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.749 
scrolling within the app tray of a
search<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.990> well<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.500> searching<00:01:59.219> apps<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
search as well for searching apps if you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.910 
search as well for searching apps if you
have<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> crazy<00:02:00.299> amount<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.799> really
