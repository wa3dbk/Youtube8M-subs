00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the bishop here should black have run

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.590

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
fairly quick but i believe white did

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.359 
fairly quick but i believe white did
give<00:01:26.070> black<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.880> opportunity<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.530> play<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> g4

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and black do not run forward with it to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
and black do not run forward with it to
give<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.240> bishop<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.720> night<00:01:33.840> exchange

may seem a little bit awkward to give up
the<00:01:37.470> bishop<00:01:37.799> pair<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.310> again<00:01:38.430> recognize

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the space judging by the pawn structure

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.950 
the space judging by the pawn structure
white<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> space<00:01:43.229> advantage<00:01:43.770> black<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
white has a space advantage black and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.050 
white has a space advantage black and
their<00:01:45.960> light<00:01:46.590> square<00:01:46.890> Bishop<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.610> often

their light square Bishop will often

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.179 
their light square Bishop will often
just<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> great<00:01:49.680> role<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
just not really have a great role so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
just not really have a great role so
you'll<00:01:50.460> look<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:51.000> give<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.290> light

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you'll look to just give up the light

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
you'll look to just give up the light
square<00:01:52.680> Bishop<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.340> night<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.759> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
doing so you increase your control over

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.480 
doing so you increase your control over
these<00:01:55.829> dark<00:01:56.130> squares<00:01:57.649> also<00:01:58.649> another<00:01:58.920> worthy

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
the point of that and let me also add

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.460 
the point of that and let me also add
that<00:03:27.820> just<00:03:28.330> because<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.600> don't<00:03:28.870> see<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.110> point

that just because I don't see the point

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.490 
that just because I don't see the point
of<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.890> does<00:03:30.160> not<00:03:30.400> mean<00:03:30.610> it's<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.940> good<00:03:31.090> move

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
of it does not mean it's a good move

believe<00:03:32.500> me<00:03:32.830> believe<00:03:33.250> me<00:03:33.520> on<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:33.940> one<00:03:34.410> maybe

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
believe me believe me on that one maybe

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.229 
believe me believe me on that one maybe
there<00:03:35.620> was<00:03:35.650> some<00:03:36.010> battery<00:03:36.580> going<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.209> just

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
there was some battery going on I just
