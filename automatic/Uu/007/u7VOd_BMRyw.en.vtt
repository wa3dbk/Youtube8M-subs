buttons don't work for everything else

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.470 
buttons don't work for everything else
but<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:58.920> back<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.190> band<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.360> got

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480

your satellite radio takes a second to
read<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.650> then<00:03:13.830> you're<00:03:13.950> back<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.100> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
read it and then you're back to a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.490 
read it and then you're back to a
satellite<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.900> these<00:03:16.019> buttons<00:03:16.380> are

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
