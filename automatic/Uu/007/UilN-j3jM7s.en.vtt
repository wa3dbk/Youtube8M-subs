00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone who likes to meet us 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.000
 my YouTube channel today we are going to talk 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 of a subject that interests us all as 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.910
 go very well dressed to an interview 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:16.590
 of work when we go to this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 interview of our dreams always 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 we receive advice from the most 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 close to us our friends 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.310
 our relatives and even our 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.560
 final boyfriend then we started to put together 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 that look and what we do is put ourselves 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 a jacket to put on a skirt or can 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.399
 be a trousers advise us not to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 let's go with something very low-cut with a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.300
 miniskirt that the hair has to be 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.550
 very clean and brushed that we use the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 french style nails and that makeup 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 from being very sober to good and that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.680
 shoes have to combine with the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.160
 road and we put together a look of what 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.320
 more boring and when we do not have all 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 those elements that have advised us to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 our relatives to put together the super 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 look for this interview 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.590
 what we do is resort to the look 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 patchwork quilt the jacket of the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.190
 friend mom's shirt and shoes 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 of the premium that we are left narrow if 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 we arrive at a job interview 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.580
 a look like this what we are going to achieve is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.220
 see us insecure and it's going to be a total 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.290
 failure then if you have to invest 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.330
 to the locker room for this interview 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.890
 work the most important thing that is going to 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.180
 show in mind when we go to a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 job interview is to know the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.750
 company this is the first investigation 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.430
 what we should do is not the same between 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 the work of a cutting company 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 traditional to go to an interview 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.430
 work of a creative cutting company 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.220
 a traditional company for example are 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.410
 the banks is a state company are 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.150
 companies where the wardrobe to be very 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.369
 partner but when we go to an interview 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.619
 of work that is a cutting company 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.930
 creative we can wear costumes more than 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.060
 trend more color there are we talk about the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 advertising agencies of the magazines 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.800
 of health or fashion companies that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.630
 they dedicate to marketing and the looks go to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.400
 be more casual where we can play a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.050
 little bit more with those good bonuses is going to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.000
 start by showing them some examples of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.380
 garments that would be ideal for a 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.540
 interview in traditional company 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 if we talk about blank prints and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.170
 black are always going to be ideal and that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.020
 be small a black pants always 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 It will get us out of trouble and if it is boot 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.360
 wide will also be ideal for a 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 traditional cutting company 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:21.570
 and here we continue with the stamp 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 little bit more risky but that fits 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.990
 within a cutting company 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.730
 traditional we have blank stripes and 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:35.250
 black a little bit of color that the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.870
 flowers the jackets and here too 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.220
 we have prints we do not think that 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.230
 because the traditional company has to 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.570
 be boring we can mix patterns 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.090
 for example here we have also 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.400
 textures on the jacket and a print 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.989
 that has three colors this is a look 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.489
 of traditional cut remember that 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.350
 traditional does not mean boring 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.300
 then they can put together their own suit or 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.070
 pants jacket set 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.440
 the same tone but different 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.660
 material and can one also carry a 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.310
 Boot pants had a company of 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.360
 traditional cut that I recommend 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.950
 earrings small or a little long but 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.840
 not extremely long because no 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.520
 it works for work people are 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.270
 you are looking at the accessory and you are not going to 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.920
 give an account 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.690
 and they will give importance to what you 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.750
 is saying we can also take the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.030
 jacket rolled up to give us a look or 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.090
 a little more casual we can also 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.130
 mix prints are going to be a very 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.110
 good option when it comes to showing that 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.900
 we are creative and that is valued 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.670
 very much in companies where people 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.620
 you have to talk about advertising 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.180
 marketing and marketing and you have to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.770
 be constantly generating ideas 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.020
 good from the first look that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.090
 I propose for creative company should 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.500
 keep in mind remember that when they go 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 to an interview in an agency 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.220
 advertising has a fashion magazine or 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.990
 who also work in all the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.760
 marketing and advertising field are going to 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.740
 value your creativity a lot at the time 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.870
 to get dressed that's why it's important that 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.520
 impact then that I propose 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.320
 mix prints here is a thread 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.420
 driver the two prints are in 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.040
 black and white and the pattern above 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.660
 and it's bigger than the one below it 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.190
 a fundamental rule when it comes to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.290
 mix prints and so that 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.130
 prints do not look disproportionate 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.130
 wear a blazer 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.150
 also in a creative cutting company 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:22.370
 the makeup is a little bit stronger and 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.860
 the hairstyle a little more carefree yes 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.230
 we already talked about a creative company and 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.670
 we can risk a little more with 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.490
 the cuts and the shapes here for example 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:40.850
 we present a skirt with a shirt 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:43.280
 white also in a creative company 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.680
 we can take risks with the colors and 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.680
 with the much more impressive prints 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.260
 when we talk about portfolios in a 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.630
 traditional company a black portfolio 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.300
 It will always be a very good purchase 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.920
 to have in our closet and make it 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.050
 a portfolio that is shaped that's what 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.490
 most important and here we see the extremes 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.840
 they are very well marked in the portfolio 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.220
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.410
