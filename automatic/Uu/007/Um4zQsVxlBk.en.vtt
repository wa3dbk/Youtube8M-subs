00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.760 
being attacked at all right so going
after<00:04:23.350> his<00:04:23.440> Bishop<00:04:23.800> here<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.620> makes

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
after his Bishop here it just makes

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.700 
after his Bishop here it just makes
sense<00:04:26.950> maybe<00:04:27.580> 92<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.930> know<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.260> is<00:04:29.410> probably

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
sense maybe 92 you know this is probably

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.810 
sense maybe 92 you know this is probably
the<00:04:29.800> best<00:04:29.920> move<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:30.370> I'll<00:04:30.460> probably<00:04:30.640> play

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
the best move then I'll probably play

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.270 
the best move then I'll probably play
rook<00:04:31.030> e8<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.660> I'm<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.890> get<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.130> bishop

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
rook e8 and I'm going to get the bishop

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.260 
rook e8 and I'm going to get the bishop
and<00:04:33.610> I'm<00:04:33.670> going<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:33.970> play<00:04:34.180> d5<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.970> other<00:04:37.120> move

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
and I'm going to play d5 the other move

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.030 
and I'm going to play d5 the other move
I<00:04:37.330> looked<00:04:37.510> at<00:04:37.600> Bishop<00:04:37.870> e5<00:04:38.020> just<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.680> sage

blame<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.530> natural<00:05:05.950> developing<00:05:06.430> move<00:05:06.610> and

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
blame is for natural developing move and

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.940 
blame is for natural developing move and
this<00:05:07.540> is<00:05:07.660> where<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:07.780> took<00:05:07.870> like<00:05:08.229> a<00:05:08.260> lot<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.770> lot

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
this is where I took like a lot of a lot

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.629 
this is where I took like a lot of a lot
of<00:05:09.070> time

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
of time

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.939 
of time
too<00:05:09.759> much<00:05:09.939> time<00:05:10.319> because<00:05:11.319> I<00:05:11.469> was<00:05:11.590> trying<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.889> I

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
too much time because I was trying to I

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.209 
too much time because I was trying to I
was<00:05:12.490> looking<00:05:12.580> at<00:05:12.819> moves<00:05:12.969> like<00:05:13.139> mission<00:05:14.139> g4<00:05:14.650> 9

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
was looking at moves like mission g4 9

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.749 
was looking at moves like mission g4 9
h5<00:05:15.759> you<00:05:16.449> know<00:05:16.539> Bishop<00:05:16.870> c4<00:05:17.199> Queen<00:05:17.560> g3<00:05:17.889> 9<00:05:18.039> h5<00:05:18.460> or

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
h5 you know Bishop c4 Queen g3 9 h5 or

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.800 
h5 you know Bishop c4 Queen g3 9 h5 or
Bishop<00:05:19.449> g4<00:05:19.840> Queen<00:05:20.169> g3<00:05:20.499> Queen<00:05:20.770> d7<00:05:21.719> you<00:05:22.719> know

Bishop g4 Queen g3 Queen d7 you know

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.300 
Bishop g4 Queen g3 Queen d7 you know
what<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:22.930> just<00:05:22.960> didn't<00:05:23.349> see<00:05:23.439> anything<00:05:23.620> forcing

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
what I just didn't see anything forcing

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.279 
what I just didn't see anything forcing
I<00:05:24.610> was<00:05:24.819> also<00:05:25.029> looking<00:05:25.150> at<00:05:25.360> playing<00:05:25.569> pawn<00:05:25.990> takes

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
I was also looking at playing pawn takes

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.450 
I was also looking at playing pawn takes
e4<00:05:28.229> so<00:05:29.229> out<00:05:29.319> of<00:05:29.349> pawn<00:05:29.590> takes<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:29.979> can<00:05:30.129> play<00:05:30.249> Queen

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
e4 so out of pawn takes I can play Queen

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.019 
e4 so out of pawn takes I can play Queen
d3<00:05:30.969> or<00:05:31.499> Bishop<00:05:32.499> g4<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:33.099> Queen<00:05:33.310> d3<00:05:33.639> you<00:05:33.939> know

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
d3 or Bishop g4 and Queen d3 you know

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.040 
d3 or Bishop g4 and Queen d3 you know
ideas<00:05:34.360> like<00:05:34.509> that<00:05:34.539> but<00:05:34.749> I<00:05:34.810> didn't<00:05:34.960> see

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
ideas like that but I didn't see

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.860 
ideas like that but I didn't see
anything<00:05:35.169> forcing<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.240> played<00:05:37.449> this<00:05:37.599> move

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
anything forcing so I played this move

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.100 
anything forcing so I played this move
which<00:05:38.759> it's<00:05:39.759> hard<00:05:40.029> to<00:05:40.150> argue<00:05:40.330> with<00:05:40.479> because<00:05:40.960> it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
which it's hard to argue with because it

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.080 
which it's hard to argue with because it
does<00:05:41.289> put<00:05:41.680> considerable<00:05:42.009> pressure<00:05:42.520> on<00:05:42.849> on

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
does put considerable pressure on on

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.939 
does put considerable pressure on on
white<00:05:43.449> and<00:05:43.750> these<00:05:43.840> are<00:05:44.020> forced<00:05:44.439> these<00:05:44.800> are

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
white and these are forced these are

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.519 
white and these are forced these are
force<00:05:45.159> moves<00:05:45.460> right<00:05:45.610> he's<00:05:46.060> got<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.419> take<00:05:46.539> it<00:05:46.599> no

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.529 
force moves right he's got to take it no

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.129 
force moves right he's got to take it no
I<00:05:47.560> can<00:05:47.949> play<00:05:48.099> g5<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.789> in<00:05:49.389> this<00:05:49.539> position<00:05:49.960> this

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
I can play g5 and in this position this

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.379 
I can play g5 and in this position this
is<00:05:50.289> where<00:05:50.439> he<00:05:50.620> lost<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.949> Queen<00:05:51.189> but<00:05:51.430> if<00:05:51.669> he

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
is where he lost the Queen but if he

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.050 
is where he lost the Queen but if he
played<00:05:52.599> Bishop<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:53.080> e5<00:05:53.319> here<00:05:54.069> but<00:05:54.729> she's<00:05:54.939> the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
played Bishop to e5 here but she's the

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.640 
played Bishop to e5 here but she's the
only<00:05:55.090> move<00:05:55.919> um<00:05:56.969> it's<00:05:57.969> interesting

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:12.559 

Bishop<00:06:02.650> e5<00:06:02.830> g<00:06:03.689> 4<00:06:06.749> queen<00:06:07.749> g3<00:06:08.789> Knight<00:06:09.789> age<00:06:09.969> 5

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.959 

that's<00:06:13.569> pretty<00:06:13.839> cool<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.349> think<00:06:15.219> he<00:06:15.490> was<00:06:15.669> losing

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
that's pretty cool I think he was losing

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.649 
that's pretty cool I think he was losing
here<00:06:16.300> after<00:06:16.539> g5<00:06:17.759> hadn't<00:06:18.759> seen<00:06:18.909> this<00:06:19.029> first<00:06:19.330> so

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
here after g5 hadn't seen this first so

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:26.189 
here after g5 hadn't seen this first so
it<00:06:20.500> would<00:06:20.650> go<00:06:21.479> Bishop<00:06:22.479> e5<00:06:24.599> push<00:06:25.599> the<00:06:25.779> pawn<00:06:25.990> to

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
it would go Bishop e5 push the pawn to

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.779 
it would go Bishop e5 push the pawn to
g4<00:06:26.649> if<00:06:27.159> Bishop<00:06:27.969> takes<00:06:28.330> pawn<00:06:28.689> takes<00:06:29.649> it<00:06:30.189> should

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
g4 if Bishop takes pawn takes it should

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.839 
g4 if Bishop takes pawn takes it should
takes<00:06:31.169> context<00:06:32.169> he<00:06:32.259> loses<00:06:32.469> the<00:06:32.529> rope<00:06:32.849> it

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849
