 a product that is going to be really multi 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.979
 face but here we will focus on 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 care of the face and a small agreement 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.350
 bonus here we will start with the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.990
 first tip 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 ok so which is what do you Czech 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.850
 the brick to add like that it takes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.829
 really the truth is still if you 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 take a little vinegar on the a86 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.060
 tight pores 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 in vain in fact it's really 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.939
 especially for oily skin 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.439
 because if you have dry skin or 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.729
 sensitive really advise you not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.840
 good if you have skin 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.549
 oily and imperfections 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.649
 recovery is not going to lie, it's also the 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.970
 really fiq to the resins actually they have 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.009
 need it's not necessary to see 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.099
 apply at the zone level rather 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:12.110
 dry the zone the famous zone t the nose 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:17.090
 this is the common front on what shines 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.860
 a little bit often but suddenly 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.120
 rinse after where it's good we're assaulted 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.620
 like that we can leave it like that is 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.760
 what can I put behind my cream 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.959
 of day make up what I can 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.190
 do it rinse it maybe we'll 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.540
 to do but I wait about ten 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.800
 minute story vinegar 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.810
 cider can do its job well 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 usually we can leave it like that 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.380
 but in real life and especially a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.319
 practical point of view it's not feasible 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.390
 good she assumed row 2 so then we 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.120
 will use the clay ok so that's 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.370
 party demonstration so we will replace 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.569
 water by cider vinegar okay 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.530
 what way will we have all the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.319
 properties of vinegar 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.880
 So it really does to the eye 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.860
 undertake a little bit that 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.840
 will be applied just at the level of 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.099
 pretty greasy areas or hockey at these 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.069
 problematic that is to say almost 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.900
 I'm afraid so there you put what or little 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.000
 near there you put pretty much so a 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.350
 big tablespoon of clay and we got 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.970
 just and there you just put here is a 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.019
 tablespoon of vinegar 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.690

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.470
 apply it with a brush too 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.410
 especially for his faulty bottom masks 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.989
 means we will do with a douar the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.579
 great and a production 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.310
