crystal<00:01:59.490> at<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> top<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.209> order<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.810> my

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
crystal at the top in order to be my

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.169 
crystal at the top in order to be my
little<00:02:01.169> hanger<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.679> go<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.249> earring<00:02:02.639> if

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
little hanger to go on the earring if

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.550 
little hanger to go on the earring if
you<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.659> creative<00:02:03.929> at<00:02:04.139> the<00:02:04.229> bottom

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you get really creative at the bottom

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.529 
you get really creative at the bottom
you<00:02:04.709> can<00:02:04.859> make<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> bow<00:02:05.279> with<00:02:05.520> 11<00:02:05.909> OC<00:02:06.299> beads

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
you can make a bow with 11 OC beads

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.020 
you can make a bow with 11 OC beads
making<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.319> loop<00:02:07.529> going<00:02:07.919> through<00:02:08.399> making<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
making a loop going through making a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
making a loop going through making a
loop<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.750> letting<00:02:09.959> some<00:02:10.259> fringe<00:02:10.500> hiding

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
loop and then letting some fringe hiding

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.710 
loop and then letting some fringe hiding
down<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.310> well<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.760> I'll<00:02:12.150> show<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
down as well and I'll show that in a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.050 
down as well and I'll show that in a
second
