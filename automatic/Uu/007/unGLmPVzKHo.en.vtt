this one's gonna be on wine tricks a lot
people<00:00:03.629> heard<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.899> wine<00:00:04.200> but<00:00:04.710> they've

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
people heard of wine but they've

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.800 
people heard of wine but they've
probably<00:00:05.400> never<00:00:05.609> heard<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.940> wine<00:00:06.180> tricks<00:00:06.600> or

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
probably never heard of wine tricks or

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.540 
probably never heard of wine tricks or
maybe<00:00:07.589> they<00:00:07.740> heard<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:08.340> they<00:00:08.490> don't

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
maybe they heard of it but they don't

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.830 
maybe they heard of it but they don't
know<00:00:08.670> how<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> use<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.179> or<00:00:09.300> why<00:00:09.450> they<00:00:09.599> need<00:00:09.719> to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
know how to use it or why they need to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.419 
know how to use it or why they need to
use<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.230> uh-huh

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
use it uh-huh

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.660 
use it uh-huh
anyways<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.389> wine<00:00:12.599> tricks<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.670> helper

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
anyways with wine tricks is is a helper

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.189 
anyways with wine tricks is is a helper
to<00:00:14.880> wine<00:00:15.740> demos<00:00:16.820> dependencies<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:18.119> wine<00:00:18.390> you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
to wine demos dependencies for wine you

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.990 
to wine demos dependencies for wine you
know<00:00:19.289> games<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:19.830> software<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.580> quick<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
know games or software really quick and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
know games or software really quick and
inefficient<00:00:21.720> instead<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> wasting<00:00:23.130> your

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
inefficient instead of you wasting your

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.820 
inefficient instead of you wasting your
time<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.850> google<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
time going on google and look for the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
time going on google and look for the
file<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:27.320> it's<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
file that you need it's kind of like a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.220 
file that you need it's kind of like a
package<00:00:29.010> manager<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> way<00:00:29.970> anyways<00:00:30.960> this

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
package manager in that way anyways this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.110 
package manager in that way anyways this
put<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.099> action<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.820> understand

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
put this in action so you can understand

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.209 
put this in action so you can understand
what<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.300> talking<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.110> would<00:00:34.739> say<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219

what I'm talking about I would say this
is<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> command-line<00:00:36.000> tool<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.899> there's<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> GUI

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
is a command-line tool but there's a GUI

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000 
is a command-line tool but there's a GUI
for<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.520> also<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.180> use<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
for it also if you like to use it so you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490 
for it also if you like to use it so you
type<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.370> wine<00:00:41.670> tricks<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.780> want<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> use

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
type in wine tricks if you want to use

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.270 
type in wine tricks if you want to use
the<00:00:43.649> GUI<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.820> hit<00:00:44.969> enter<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> looks

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
not that removed your synaptic package

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
not that removed your synaptic package
manager<00:00:54.149> okay<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:55.590> gave<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> description

manager okay they gave you a description

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.400 
manager okay they gave you a description
and<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> packages<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> side<00:00:58.140> here

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and then the packages on the side here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.279 
and then the packages on the side here
all<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:00.449> say<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.570> example<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
all right so let's say for example I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.369 
all right so let's say for example I
want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> install<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:03.110> 7-zip<00:01:04.110> here

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
want to install one of these 7-zip here

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.030 
want to install one of these 7-zip here
so<00:01:04.890> check<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> box<00:01:05.610> hit<00:01:06.360> OK<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so check the box hit OK and you see it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
so check the box hit OK and you see it
just<00:01:08.189> goes<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> internet<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
just goes out in the internet and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080 
just goes out in the internet and
downloads<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.619> tells<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.130> if

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
downloads it for you and tells you if

downloads it for you and tells you if
you<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> install<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.799> hit<00:01:13.950> next

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you want to install it so you hit next

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
you want to install it so you hit next
or<00:01:14.610> whatever<00:01:15.390> finish<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.590> done<00:01:17.689> basically

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
or whatever finish you're done basically

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.790 
or whatever finish you're done basically

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
that's what it is okay

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.680 
that's what it is okay
so<00:01:21.220> how<00:01:21.370> do<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.580> know<00:01:21.700> when<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.240> need<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.420> use

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
so how do you know when you need to use

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.890 
so how do you know when you need to use
it<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.980> is<00:01:24.190> where<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.640> use<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.000> was<00:01:25.750> it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
it and this is where you use the was it

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.830 
it and this is where you use the was it
the<00:01:26.080> wine<00:01:26.320> half<00:01:26.620> database<00:01:27.300> so<00:01:28.300> go<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.570> their

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
the wine half database so go to their

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.610 
the wine half database so go to their
site<00:01:29.190> should<00:01:30.190> be<00:01:30.250> y<00:01:30.550> HQ<00:01:31.150> organ<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.470> have

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
site should be y HQ organ and you have

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.969 
site should be y HQ organ and you have
app<00:01:32.860> database<00:01:33.490> or<00:01:33.670> something

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
app database or something

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.760 
app database or something
and<00:01:35.979> then<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:36.910> look<00:01:37.090> for<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.810> file<00:01:38.110> or<00:01:38.440> was<00:01:38.650> it

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
and then you look for the file or was it

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.560 
and then you look for the file or was it
the<00:01:38.920> software<00:01:39.400> or<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.760> games<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.360> want

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
the software or the games that you want

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.920 
the software or the games that you want
to<00:01:40.780> run<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:42.400> make<00:01:43.119> sure<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.900> all

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
to run and make sure that you have all

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.320 
to run and make sure that you have all
the<00:01:44.229> dependencies<00:01:44.800> for<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.130> sometimes<00:01:46.090> check

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
the dependencies for it sometimes check

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.940 
the dependencies for it sometimes check
the<00:01:46.479> rating<00:01:46.840> if<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.080> says<00:01:47.229> garbage<00:01:47.800> or

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
the rating if it says garbage or

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.560 
the rating if it says garbage or
something<00:01:47.979> you<00:01:48.460> know<00:01:48.580> then<00:01:48.850> it's<00:01:49.270> not<00:01:49.390> gonna

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
something you know then it's not gonna

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.600 
something you know then it's not gonna
work<00:01:49.869> but<00:01:50.380> this<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.680> platinum<00:01:50.979> or<00:01:51.310> something

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
work but this is platinum or something

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.499 
work but this is platinum or something
or<00:01:51.760> silver<00:01:52.240> then<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.259> probably<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.740> do

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
or silver then you probably have to do

wine tricks and I need to install these

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.420 
wine tricks and I need to install these
two<00:02:09.520> packages<00:02:09.970> here<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:11.260> VC<00:02:11.770> run<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
two packages here the VC run and the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.180 
two packages here the VC run and the
DirectX<00:02:12.850> 9<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.140> part<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.650> kind<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.160> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
DirectX 9 so this part is kind of like a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.050 
DirectX 9 so this part is kind of like a
sudo<00:02:15.880> apt-get<00:02:16.270> install<00:02:16.830> if<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.670> want<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.910> do

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
in here all right wine tricks these two

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.320 
in here all right wine tricks these two
packages<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.670> says<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> need<00:02:35.090> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
packages that it says that I need to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.720 
packages that it says that I need to
install<00:02:36.190> basically<00:02:37.190> you'll<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.610> the

same thing you know go out there in the
internet<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:41.020> after<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.319> downloads<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:43.010> I'll

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
internet and after it downloads it I'll

internet and after it downloads it I'll
give<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.640> prompt<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.360> click<00:02:44.780> Next<00:02:45.140> Next

know when you need to use it now where

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.410 
know when you need to use it now where

did they save this is to your your home

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.490 
did they save this is to your your home
folder<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.530> wine<00:02:57.830> tricks<00:02:58.480> catch<00:02:59.480> here<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.380> if

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
folder that wine tricks catch here so if

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
folder that wine tricks catch here so if
you<00:03:00.620> ever<00:03:00.709> want<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> delete<00:03:01.250> some<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.209> these

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
you ever want to delete some of these

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.000 
you ever want to delete some of these
because<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.050> know<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.200> does<00:03:03.620> take<00:03:03.830> up<00:03:03.860> a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
because it you know it does take up a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.009 
because it you know it does take up a
space<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:06.590> go<00:03:06.830> into<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:08.150> folder<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.630> just

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
space just go into that folder and just

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.540 
space just go into that folder and just
delete<00:03:09.319> all<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.650> ones<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.040> don't<00:03:10.310> need

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
delete all the ones that you don't need

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.780 
delete all the ones that you don't need
anymore<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.860> simple<00:03:12.860> as<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.340> all<00:03:13.550> here

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
anymore and simple as that is all here

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.199 
anymore and simple as that is all here
so<00:03:14.780> that's<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.230> for<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.880> install

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
so that's it for that and to install

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.550 
so that's it for that and to install
this<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.370> first<00:03:20.060> install<00:03:20.660> wine<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.290> should

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
this if you first install wine it should

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.460 
this if you first install wine it should
come<00:03:22.130> with<00:03:22.459> wine<00:03:22.700> tricks<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.900> make<00:03:24.200> sure<00:03:24.230> you

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
come with wine tricks so make sure you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.170 
come with wine tricks so make sure you
have<00:03:24.650> wine<00:03:25.160> here<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.000> this<00:03:26.239> is<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.420> file<00:03:26.660> wine

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
have wine here so this is the file wine

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.270 
have wine here so this is the file wine
and<00:03:28.569> wine<00:03:29.170> tricks<00:03:29.439> should<00:03:29.650> come<00:03:29.829> with<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.099> but

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
and wine tricks should come with it but

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.860 
and wine tricks should come with it but
it<00:03:30.370> doesn't<00:03:30.700> come<00:03:30.849> with<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.659> always

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
it doesn't come with it you can always

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.530 
it doesn't come with it you can always
install<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.560> yourself<00:03:32.860> so<00:03:33.849> it's<00:03:34.000> called<00:03:34.329> wine

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
install it yourself so it's called wine

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.970 
install it yourself so it's called wine
tricks<00:03:34.870> here<00:03:35.110> all<00:03:35.620> right

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
tricks here all right

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.819 
tricks here all right
and<00:03:36.670> sometimes<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.390> need<00:03:37.569> this<00:03:37.840> file<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.439> the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
and sometimes you need this file to the

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.819 
and sometimes you need this file to the
cap<00:03:39.099> extract<00:03:39.640> because<00:03:40.000> sometimes<00:03:40.829> the

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
cap extract because sometimes the

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.979 
cap extract because sometimes the
dependencies<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.489> come<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:43.060> dot<00:03:43.269> cap<00:03:43.659> file

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
dependencies that come in a dot cap file

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.130 
dependencies that come in a dot cap file
and<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:45.609> would<00:03:45.700> have<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:45.939> extract<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:46.870> you

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
and you would have to extract it so you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.059 
and you would have to extract it so you
need<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.560> cap<00:03:48.250> extract<00:03:48.760> file<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.650> these

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
need to cap extract file so so these

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.720 
need to cap extract file so so these
three<00:03:51.430> just<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.299> case<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:53.260> need<00:03:53.439> it<00:03:53.730> and

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
three just in case you need it and
