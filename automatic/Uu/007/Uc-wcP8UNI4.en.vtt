00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.329
 in 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.019
 very good friends at number 10 of the 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.730
 list is the nintendo 64 logo 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.100
 a quick and curious fact is that if 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.230
 we count the vertices and count the 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.890
 faces that source this wolf in total 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.560
 resulting 64 vertices and 64 faces the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.329
 that make up the logo of Nintendo a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.460
 small curious fact about the logo of 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.460
 this famous video game company 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 as number 9 we have the famous wii 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.239
 sports resorts and that famous game of 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.250
 nintendo wii which gives us hours and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.739
 hours of fun with the minis 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.840
 Well, initially the characters 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.750
 main were going to be the characters of 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.570
 Luis Mario May without equal 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.660
 all these characters were going to conform 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.150
 the repertoire of tyc sports resorts but 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.580
 nintendo said you know we do not want that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.070
 Mario is the protagonist we are going to put 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.410
 the little funny ones is that's why 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.600
 that you now play tennis with your own 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.600
 pussycat with the spectacular arm 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.000
 as number 8 we can appreciate in this 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.909
 picture that on top of the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 door is the shield of capcom this is 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.409
 in received 3 simply a small 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.479
 curious fact about this famous saga 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.060
 of zombies made by the company 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.530
 capcom and good that we hope we have more 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.530

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.590
 as number 7 we have for fans 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.380
 of soccer something that maybe they already know or 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.360
 maybe not but let's mention it in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.180
 pokemon stadium elect bus was 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.150
 wrongly done with six fingers yes 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.070
 gentlemen has six fingers and good 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.050
 because this error was not corrected for 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 next installment of pokemon station 2 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.160
 apparently others everything that was 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.530
 six euros and well it was just a small 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.630
 curious fact about pokemon station for 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.410
 all pokemon fans 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.410

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.190
 very good friends we continue with the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.619
 number 6 on the list as everyone knows the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.130
 first street fighter in the salons of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.130
 Kate in 1987 some years later 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.440
 capcom prepares a sequel to the title and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.330
 it's going to be street fighter 89 but 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.970
 they preferred to separate it from the good meeting 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.460
 their expire and good they changed us the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.460
 name for the one of final fight five 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.489
 as number 5 we have another data 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.860
 interesting for the servers of 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.590
 Pokemon is a little curious fact nothing 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.780
 more in the Japanese version of pokemon the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.630
 attack of normal type self description is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.150
 change the name to a suicide bomb 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.620
 suicidal bomb as well as a kamikaze is a 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.390
 little cat nothing more about these 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.390

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.730

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.410
 bed yes this little blue character with 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.720
 the one that all or most of us 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.360
 we played the color of megaman it was 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.640
 blue for the small amount of colors 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.350
 with which the email had the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.630
 designers saw any the color 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.790
 easier or more feasible for this 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.340
 console then they decided the color 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.580
 blue for our good friend mega my 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.580

 gym in each of these versions 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.720

 as number two we have the sagas of 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.239
 big missed only as a curious fact 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.250
 if we compare the source of hitting the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.620
 price with the grand theft auto 'we see 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.590
 which is the same yes gentlemen use the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.569
 same big font author loyal tub 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.430
 price a little curiosity that maybe 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.260
 they did not already know that many of us 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.980
 Sometimes we do not pay attention to these 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.980
 small details 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.280

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.859
 friendly gorillas were going to carry guns 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.840
 truth and shoot ammunition but hey 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.939
 to revilla and nintendo they were made that was going 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.769
 to be very violent and they preferred 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.259
 change them for wooden weapons that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.000
 will shoot fruit and nuts you know the 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.590

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.150
