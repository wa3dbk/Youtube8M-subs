00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it uses three different colors and then

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
it uses three different colors and then
I<00:01:55.229> also<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:55.979> tops

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I also for like tops

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.780 
I also for like tops
take<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.860> simply<00:01:59.189> tied<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
take it up it's just simply tied in the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.929 
take it up it's just simply tied in the
back

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
back

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.340 
back
and<00:02:03.030> I'll<00:02:04.030> put<00:02:04.240> together<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.600> kit<00:02:04.929> that<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.109> can

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
and I'll put together a kit that you can

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.950 
and I'll put together a kit that you can
buy<00:02:05.609> on<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:06.670> site<00:02:06.969> so<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.149> don't<00:02:07.359> to<00:02:07.479> buy<00:02:07.630> like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
buy on the site so you don't to buy like

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.259 
buy on the site so you don't to buy like
three<00:02:08.289> different<00:02:08.500> skeins<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.190> colors<00:02:09.549> so<00:02:10.149> I'll

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
three different skeins of colors so I'll

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.820 
three different skeins of colors so I'll
be<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.840> know<00:02:10.929> pretty<00:02:11.110> expensive<00:02:11.440> if

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
be like you know pretty expensive if

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.710 
be like you know pretty expensive if
you're<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.160> using<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.180> much<00:02:13.390> yarn

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you're just using like this much yarn

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.979 
you're just using like this much yarn
for<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> I'll<00:02:16.030> make<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.450> mini<00:02:16.629> kit<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
for it so I'll make it a mini kit and

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.670 
for it so I'll make it a mini kit and
I'll<00:02:17.049> include<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.500> beads<00:02:17.739> but<00:02:18.280> check<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.459> out

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
I'll include the beads but check it out

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.680 
I'll include the beads but check it out
so<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.090> kind<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.420> loop<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.480> loop

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
so you just kind of loop the you loop

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.539 
so you just kind of loop the you loop
and<00:02:25.900> make<00:02:25.930> flowers<00:02:26.530> look<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.040> quickly

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
and make flowers look really quickly

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.780 
and make flowers look really quickly
with<00:02:28.799> with<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.890> starry<00:02:30.099> ribbon<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.489> used<00:02:30.670> two

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
with with the starry ribbon I used two

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.830 
with with the starry ribbon I used two
different<00:02:30.819> colors<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.390> use<00:02:31.569> two<00:02:31.720> different

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
different colors I use two different

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.199 
different colors I use two different
kinds<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.230> beads<00:02:32.440> Boise<00:02:33.340> as<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.519> put<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.940> put<00:02:33.970> a

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
kinds of beads Boise as I put it I put a

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.930 
kinds of beads Boise as I put it I put a
pearl<00:02:34.599> like<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.989> bead<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.620> glue<00:02:35.680> done<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.250> stuck

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
pearl like a bead of glue done I stuck

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.539 
pearl like a bead of glue done I stuck
the<00:02:38.160> fabric<00:02:39.160> into<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.750> bead<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.310> then<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> just

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
the fabric into the bead and then I just

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.860 
the fabric into the bead and then I just
braid<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.849> for<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.239> part<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:43.690> goes<00:02:43.750> around

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
braid it for the part that goes around

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.539 
braid it for the part that goes around
your<00:02:44.049> head<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.470> simply<00:02:44.739> braid<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.250> three

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
your head I just simply braid it three

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.699 
your head I just simply braid it three
strands<00:02:46.180> together<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:47.200> these<00:02:47.319> are<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.530> colors

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
strands together so these are the colors

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.970 
strands together so these are the colors
I<00:02:47.980> chose<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.090> want<00:02:49.269> different<00:02:49.450> colors
