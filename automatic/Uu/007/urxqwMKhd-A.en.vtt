piece after that we're gonna set up our

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.789 
piece after that we're gonna set up our
machine<00:00:12.540> countersink<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.500> we're<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
machine countersink and we're going to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.790 

Rhonda<00:00:50.360> step<00:00:50.570> number<00:00:50.720> three<00:00:51.050> now<00:00:51.199> what<00:00:51.710> we

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
Rhonda step number three now what we

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.619 
Rhonda step number three now what we
need<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.070> do<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.489> adjust<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.000> juggle<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:53.449> was

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
need to do is adjust the juggle that was

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.569 
need to do is adjust the juggle that was
created<00:00:54.019> by<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.170> hydraulic<00:00:54.710> press<00:00:54.949> now

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
created by the hydraulic press now

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.100 
created by the hydraulic press now
sometimes<00:00:56.000> when<00:00:56.180> these<00:00:56.360> pieces<00:00:56.600> are<00:00:56.839> pressed

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
sometimes when these pieces are pressed

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.869 
sometimes when these pieces are pressed
they<00:00:57.409> don't<00:00:57.589> quite<00:00:57.860> come<00:00:58.190> out<00:00:58.220> perfectly

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
they don't quite come out perfectly

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.149 
they don't quite come out perfectly
parallel<00:00:59.089> so<00:00:59.900> what<00:01:00.019> we<00:01:00.110> need<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.379> do<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.920> take<00:01:01.100> a

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
parallel so what we need to do is take a

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.070 
parallel so what we need to do is take a
pair<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.460> pliers<00:01:01.550> preferably<00:01:02.420> ones<00:01:02.690> without

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
pair of pliers preferably ones without

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.990 
pair of pliers preferably ones without
teeth<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.860> as<00:01:03.979> we<00:01:04.040> don't<00:01:04.159> Mar<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.580> aluminum

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
teeth so as we don't Mar the aluminum

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.710 
teeth so as we don't Mar the aluminum
and<00:01:05.150> straighten<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:07.030> for<00:01:08.030> step<00:01:08.210> number<00:01:08.360> four

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
and straighten it for step number four

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.120 
and straighten it for step number four
we're<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.020> use<00:01:09.140> our<00:01:09.320> rivet<00:01:09.500> squeezer

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
we're going to use our rivet squeezer

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.980 
we're going to use our rivet squeezer
for<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:10.520> particular<00:01:10.729> application<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.869> have
