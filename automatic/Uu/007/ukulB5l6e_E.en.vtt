00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello my crafter and sincerely love 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.910
 welcome to another video of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.589
 the 17th 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.500
 Today I show you the plug-in 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.679
 stargate with this plugin you can 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.420
 make portals so to speak and you can 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.670
 in the world, so to speak , back and forth 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 teleport with the help of gm portal 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 but that was in the normal world 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.090
 as always a bit complicated 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.760
 explains but we were now first 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.890
 once the plug-in down via download 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.859
 and again download that is the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 version 0.7 point 7.2 saved 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.730
 start point and open the server and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.340
 opens the plugins folder there we have 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 now only the pack 1 installs that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 animal is likely to recognize and pull the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.270
 stargate so just in the server so 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.030
 we start the server now 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.969
 that no error message come stargate 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 seems to be loaded and then look 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.070
 Let's see what's in the plugins folder for folders 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.330
 is we were going well and plugins 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.119
 have a folder there long orders 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 There we can pack the language 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.180
 So the language in the plug-in 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 should work 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 There are different languages 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.710
 packs you can find here under language 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.150
 packs and we take the german txt 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:29.340
 file and go back to ours now 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.270
 open plugins folder and paste now 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.320
 just here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.180
 this text here with ctrl c and strg v 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 here again and now we have here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.460
 promise a German translation 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 we lock ourselves and that means now 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 Although still a worker does not bother us 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.830
 have a German here now 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.820
 said package 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.410
 once back and can do that here 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.230
 support us again and look us now 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.600
 in the configuration file of the plugin 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.870
 it's all about us and we have one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 conflict point j &amp; m ly open world if 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.869
 one with notepad + + and there you can 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.910
 set in which folder folder that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.780
 just saved should be that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.660
 in the plug in stargate portals where the gates 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.940
 to be saved and and and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.740
 and and should do it all at one 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.900
 explosion should be broken 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.350
 how many maximum gates for that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.230
 language we would do that in text files 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.270
 de rename and then here we have to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.360
 You can also enter it 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.740
 on s not that this disturbed here 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 you do not necessarily have to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.820
 one read by which sign color yes 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.270
 There is a lot to try 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.550
 if this is blood then if we 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.800
 not sure should one Karimi 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.160
 No, why is it used ? 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.110
 recognizes money by giving and we 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.910
 now let times the rest as it is 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.130
 that actually set quite well how 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.440
 always we have changed ourselves 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.690
 again in the gates volt can 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.100
 We will then stop the files later 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.350
 was created look 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.640
 because every portal is here to a 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.800
 create a file 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.459
 So now we'll see each other 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.080
 again gravel and see you soon so hello and 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.640
 Welcome now to the in 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.470
 gives 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.330
 and I have one now 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.730
 set up some portals that I do 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.650
 but once broken and actually 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.350
 you only have to when you star the patent 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.910
 money has now been installed to build portals 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.590
 you can do it against more completely 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.530
 make it look better again 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.540
 then you build a button here 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.980
 just a normal pack and 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.380
 then turn on the left side 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.420
 a shield and look for one now 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.670
 names for this money because this portal 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.430
 him out I call it again now 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 1 and then we get the message 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.110
 created by stargate if we are here now 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.640
 press on the club still happens 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.280
 not because we have one here 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.860
 right-click to solve this 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.959
 I stood on it but he may still 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.760
 did not create a second monetary 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.350
 It is clear that nothing happens here 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.420
 so just create us one 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.580
 second kate after the same example 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.260
 a meter portal there a button and 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.340
 then maybe we'll take it 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.230
 2 so now we have created the g2 and 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.080
 As always when I click on the money 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.090
 to use if we are here now 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.970
 then we can do a right click 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.070
 Here on, go to access two if you can 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.080
 press the button you will see it is closing 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.840
 a portal will bring you through and through 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.979
 are teleported as we are there 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.750
 descends below 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.880
 We can connect to this network then 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.440
 also a third portal to the 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.510
 Add an example that's what we do 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.050
 easy if for example gate 3 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.120
 call 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.070
 but you can do as you want 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.229
 always think of a name 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.880
 so now we'll do one 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.210
 right click on it and can select 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.650
 between gt1 and gt3 it always looks 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.510
 right-click on it and then change 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.669
 these square brackets do not surprise 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.700
 about the essentials protect messages 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.800
 this is related to utility project so 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.050
 we just want to go to gate 1 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.539
 then we press the button one sees 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.490
 that others also shine and we are 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.490
 already through we want now 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.970
 For example, to gate 3 you can find here 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.590
 on and we are there so that was 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.810
 actually pretty simple this one 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.280
 you need plug-in for that at all 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.199
 I do not use comics 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.349
 actually quite practical this 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.599
 stargate babble ok thanks so much 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.169
 you have watched this video by 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.169
 next time
