 from europe I have seen what has made us 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.880
 there are still many questions to be asked 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.730
 all her 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.250
 we'll see 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.800
 how long have you been practicing when 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.989
 is practically very very little this is 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.660
 my first year is the first few times that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.100
