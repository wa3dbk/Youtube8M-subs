00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.720 

hello<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.290> certain<00:00:02.250> that<00:00:02.340> some<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.610> you

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hello guys so certain that some of you

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.720 
hello guys so certain that some of you
use<00:00:03.449> your<00:00:03.629> notebook<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.470> take<00:00:04.950> notes<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.460> math

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
use your notebook to take notes in math

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.890 
use your notebook to take notes in math
and<00:00:06.060> chemistry<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:07.080> physics<00:00:07.560> class<00:00:07.890> etc<00:00:08.900> so

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and chemistry in physics class etc so

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.259 
and chemistry in physics class etc so
you<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> type<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.679> equations<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.519> use<00:00:12.000> word

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
you have to type in equations I use word

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.709 
you have to type in equations I use word
for<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.860> hold<00:00:14.400> down<00:00:14.519> alt<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> L

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
for that and you can hold down alt and L

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.980 
for that and you can hold down alt and L
I<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> quick<00:00:16.970> shortcut<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.330> creating<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.859 

equation<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.369> use<00:00:23.810> shortcuts<00:00:24.810> like

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
equation so you can use shortcuts like

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
equation so you can use shortcuts like
this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:43.750 

etc<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.220> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:37.040> do<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.280> regular

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.119 

and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:44.750> also<00:00:44.929> if<00:00:45.260> you're<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:45.620> chemistry

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
and you can also if you're in chemistry

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.410 
and you can also if you're in chemistry
do<00:00:46.309> something<00:00:46.640> like<00:00:46.730> this

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.490 

okay<00:00:53.130> what<00:00:54.130> you<00:00:54.190> can<00:00:54.309> also<00:00:54.430> do<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.820> open<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
okay what you can also do is open the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.119 
okay what you can also do is open the
built-in<00:00:56.500> Windows<00:00:57.040> seven<00:00:57.430> math<00:01:00.000> tablet<00:01:01.000> input

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
built-in Windows seven math tablet input

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.189 
built-in Windows seven math tablet input
equation<00:01:03.129> thing<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:04.239> we<00:01:04.360> just<00:01:04.540> go<00:01:04.989> down<00:01:05.170> here

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
equation thing so we just go down here

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.930 
equation thing so we just go down here
and<00:01:05.409> search<00:01:05.710> for<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.010> math<00:01:06.280> or<00:01:06.550> something<00:01:06.820> and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
and search for a math or something and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.810 
and search for a math or something and
you<00:01:07.030> find<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.020> what<00:01:08.920> looks<00:01:09.160> like<00:01:09.220> is<00:01:09.520> like

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
you find it and what looks like is like

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.630 
you find it and what looks like is like
this<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.650> choose<00:01:11.890> where<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.220> want<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.430> put

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
this and you choose where I want to put

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.300 
this and you choose where I want to put
it<00:01:12.759> I<00:01:13.030> think<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.570> only<00:01:13.930> works<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.560> word<00:01:15.130> and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
it I think it only works in word and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.760 
it I think it only works in word and
things<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:15.909> have<00:01:16.150> this<00:01:18.240> equation<00:01:19.770> system

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
things that have this equation system

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.510 
things that have this equation system
like<00:01:21.250> OneNote<00:01:21.880> will<00:01:22.119> have<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.360> in<00:01:22.509> 2010<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:24.159> as

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
like OneNote will have it in 2010 so as

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.020 
like OneNote will have it in 2010 so as
I<00:01:24.789> started<00:01:25.300> typing<00:01:25.539> it<00:01:26.410> will<00:01:26.470> recognize<00:01:27.250> my

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
I started typing it will recognize my

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:50.980 
I started typing it will recognize my
equation

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.219 

right<00:01:51.620> so<00:01:51.860> let's<00:01:52.280> let's<00:01:53.030> look<00:01:53.180> at<00:01:53.299> this<00:01:53.420> as<00:01:54.140> you

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
right so let's let's look at this as you

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.830 
right so let's let's look at this as you
can<00:01:54.290> see<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.890> -<00:01:55.460> what<00:01:56.210> if<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.360> wanted<00:01:56.659> it

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
can see this is a - what if I wanted it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.870 
can see this is a - what if I wanted it
to<00:01:56.990> be<00:01:57.110> set<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.640> use<00:01:58.850> right<00:01:59.450> click<00:02:02.050> choose

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
to be set I just use right click choose

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.800 
to be set I just use right click choose
see<00:02:05.200> also<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.409> can<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.799> delete<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:08.360> this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.500 

to<00:02:11.230> want<00:02:11.410> to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
to want to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.619 
to want to
and<00:02:14.459> yeah<00:02:15.459> well<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:15.910> insert<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:18.629> bam

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
and yeah well just insert it and bam

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.360 
and yeah well just insert it and bam
there<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.500> works<00:02:20.650> pretty<00:02:20.860> fine<00:02:21.099> for

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
there it is and it works pretty fine for

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.710 
there it is and it works pretty fine for
everything<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.849> course<00:02:21.879> it's<00:02:22.269> better<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.629> you

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
everything of course it's better if you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.640 
everything of course it's better if you
have<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> an<00:02:23.530> actual<00:02:23.800> tablet<00:02:24.160> computer<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.650> yeah

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
have a an actual tablet computer so yeah

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.710 
have a an actual tablet computer so yeah
I'm<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:26.980> I'm<00:02:27.220> not<00:02:27.519> gonna<00:02:27.640> yeah

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
I'm just I'm not gonna yeah

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.170 
I'm just I'm not gonna yeah
thanks<00:02:29.019> what
