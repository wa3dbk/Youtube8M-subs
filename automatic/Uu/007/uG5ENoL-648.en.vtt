Ann's<00:00:03.300> most<00:00:03.540> recent<00:00:03.870> puzzle<00:00:04.170> which<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.589> about

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
Ann's most recent puzzle which is about

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.289 
Ann's most recent puzzle which is about
a<00:00:04.830> man<00:00:05.100> who's<00:00:05.310> on<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.460> boat<00:00:05.670> dropping<00:00:06.089> an<00:00:06.180> anchor

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
a man who's on a boat dropping an anchor

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.089 
a man who's on a boat dropping an anchor
and<00:00:06.629> if<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.350> haven't<00:00:07.500> seen<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.799> yet<00:00:07.919> you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and if you haven't seen it yet you

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.730 
and if you haven't seen it yet you
should<00:00:08.189> click<00:00:08.370> right<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.590> it's<00:00:10.590> pretty

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
should click right here and it's pretty

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.249 
should click right here and it's pretty
interesting<00:00:10.980> puzzle<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:11.519> about<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> man

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
interesting puzzle it's about a man

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.350 
interesting puzzle it's about a man
who's<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> boat<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.340> pond<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.940> he

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
who's on a boat in in a pond and he

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.730 
who's on a boat in in a pond and he
drops<00:00:15.599> his<00:00:15.750> anchor<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> question<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
drops his anchor and the question is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
drops his anchor and the question is
does<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.279> water<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> pond<00:00:17.880> raise<00:00:18.210> or

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
does the water in the pond raise or

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.859 
does the water in the pond raise or
lower<00:00:19.279> when<00:00:20.279> he<00:00:20.400> drops<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> anchor<00:00:21.090> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
lower when he drops the anchor and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.029 
lower when he drops the anchor and
obviously<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.830> small

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
obviously it's going to be a very small

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
obviously it's going to be a very small
amount<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.269> uh<00:00:24.300> that's<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> puzzle<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
amount but but uh that's the puzzle and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.870 
amount but but uh that's the puzzle and
I<00:00:25.830> think<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> people<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.580> getting<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
I think a lot of people are getting it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759 
I think a lot of people are getting it
conceptually<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.720> lately<00:00:28.260> I've<00:00:28.470> been<00:00:28.500> trying

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
conceptually but lately I've been trying

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.580 
conceptually but lately I've been trying
to<00:00:28.949> learn<00:00:29.039> how<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.720> do<00:00:30.720> mathematical<00:00:31.289> proofs

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to learn how to do mathematical proofs

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.709 
to learn how to do mathematical proofs
and<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> engineering<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.540> kind

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and I'm in engineering and this is kind

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.990 
and I'm in engineering and this is kind
of<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.870> physics<00:00:34.200> engineering<00:00:34.579> type<00:00:35.579> deal<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
of a physics engineering type deal so I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
of a physics engineering type deal so I
thought<00:00:36.210> I'd<00:00:36.329> go<00:00:36.480> ahead<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.660> prove<00:00:37.410> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
thought I'd go ahead and prove it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.750 
thought I'd go ahead and prove it
mathematically<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.160> show<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
mathematically and show it to you on

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
mathematically and show it to you on
this<00:00:39.120> video<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.570> maybe<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> see

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
this video so maybe you can kind of see

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
this video so maybe you can kind of see
the<00:00:40.860> mechanics<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> how<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> prove<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.760> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the mechanics of how to prove it so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.229 
the mechanics of how to prove it so
here's<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.290> proof<00:00:43.760> all<00:00:44.760> right<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.030> we'll<00:00:45.149> start

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
here's my proof all right so we'll start

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
here's my proof all right so we'll start
by<00:00:45.390> compiling<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:46.110> formulas<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> basically

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
by compiling some formulas and basically

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
by compiling some formulas and basically
it's<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.700> two<00:00:48.090> formulas<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.840> force<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's just two formulas of force that we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
it's just two formulas of force that we
need<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.950> first<00:00:50.190> formula<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.610> need<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
need the first formula we need is just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.670 
need the first formula we need is just
the<00:00:51.239> formula<00:00:51.449> due<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> buoyancy<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.590> an

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the formula due to the buoyancy of an

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340 
the formula due to the buoyancy of an
object<00:00:53.010> which<00:00:53.520> states<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.940> force<00:00:54.840> buoyancy

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
object which states that force buoyancy

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
object which states that force buoyancy
equals<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.760> density<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.719> Rho

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
equals the density that's what that Rho

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.349 
equals the density that's what that Rho
is<00:00:57.930> density<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.710> water<00:00:58.859> times<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> volume<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
is density of water times the volume of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.389 
is density of water times the volume of
the<00:01:00.480> water<00:01:00.629> displaced<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.440> volume<00:01:02.039> displaced

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the water displaced so volume displaced

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
the water displaced so volume displaced
water<00:01:02.579> times<00:01:03.239> G<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.719> acceleration<00:01:04.379> due

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
water times G which is acceleration due

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
water times G which is acceleration due
to<00:01:04.500> gravity<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.970> second<00:01:06.299> form<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to gravity in the second form that we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.170 
to gravity in the second form that we
need<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.250> force<00:01:08.250> due<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> gravity<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
need is just force due to gravity of on

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
need is just force due to gravity of on
an<00:01:09.330> object<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.500> Ethical<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.010> MA<00:01:11.220> or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
an object so basically Ethical is MA or

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
an object so basically Ethical is MA or
force<00:01:11.970> gravity<00:01:12.330> equals<00:01:12.630> mass<00:01:12.900> times<00:01:13.140> gravity

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
force gravity equals mass times gravity

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
force gravity equals mass times gravity
so<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.310> start<00:01:14.640> off<00:01:14.700> looking<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.060> situation<00:01:15.630> one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so we start off looking at situation one

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
so we start off looking at situation one
we<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.680> man<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.100> boat

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we see we've got a little man in a boat

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.719 
we see we've got a little man in a boat
and<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.909> guess<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.360> our<00:01:18.570> seagull<00:01:19.290> anchor

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
and I guess that's our seagull anchor

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.980 
and I guess that's our seagull anchor
Tai<00:01:20.729> Han<00:01:20.880> maybe<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.330> explain<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.720> one

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
Tai Han maybe you can explain that one

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770 
Tai Han maybe you can explain that one
and<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> we'll<00:01:23.939> write<00:01:24.090> down<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.570> two

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and so we'll write down our first two

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
and so we'll write down our first two
formulas<00:01:25.259> force<00:01:25.710> Point<00:01:25.979> C<00:01:26.130> equals<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.570> for

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
formulas force Point C equals that for

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.359 
formulas force Point C equals that for
our<00:01:27.659> second<00:01:27.990> formula<00:01:28.320> we'll<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.710> force

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
our second formula we'll use force

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.899 
our second formula we'll use force
gravity<00:01:29.850> equals<00:01:30.240> MB<00:01:30.869> plus<00:01:31.409> MA<00:01:31.979> times<00:01:32.400> G<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
gravity equals MB plus MA times G and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
gravity equals MB plus MA times G and
that's<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.380> stands<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.979> mass<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that's that stands for the mass of the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.160 
that's that stands for the mass of the
boat<00:01:35.610> plus<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.299> mass<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> anchor<00:01:37.020> because

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
boat plus the mass of the anchor because

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
boat plus the mass of the anchor because
they're<00:01:37.500> together<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> sum<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they're together and we know that sum of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.660 
they're together and we know that sum of
these<00:01:39.630> forces<00:01:39.930> has<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.470> 0<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.100> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
these forces has to be 0 and so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.969 
these forces has to be 0 and so
basically<00:01:42.630> force<00:01:42.990> buoyancy<00:01:43.470> has<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> equal

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
basically force buoyancy has to equal

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.730 
basically force buoyancy has to equal
the<00:01:44.310> force<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.670> gravity<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.899> we'll<00:01:46.590> write

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the force of gravity so we'll write

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.109 
the force of gravity so we'll write
those<00:01:46.979> two<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> set<00:01:47.610> them<00:01:47.640> equal<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.970> each

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
those two out and set them equal to each

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.440 
those two out and set them equal to each
other

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
other

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
other
and<00:01:48.600> basically<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.380> solve<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> volume

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and basically just solve for the volume

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.249 
and basically just solve for the volume
of<00:01:50.909> displaced<00:01:51.360> water<00:01:51.600> because<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.079> what

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
of displaced water because that's what

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.450 
of displaced water because that's what
we're<00:01:52.350> looking<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.130> look<00:01:53.340> at

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
we're looking for and now we look at

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.310 
we're looking for and now we look at
situation<00:01:53.970> 2<00:01:54.210> which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> anchor<00:01:54.990> has

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
situation 2 which is when the anchor has

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.600 
situation 2 which is when the anchor has
dropped<00:01:55.560> there's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.159> seagull<00:01:56.399> down

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
dropped there's a little seagull down

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.340 
dropped there's a little seagull down
there

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
there

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
there
anyway<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.680> write<00:01:58.860> out<00:01:58.980> our<00:01:59.010> two<00:01:59.220> formulas

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
anyway so we write out our two formulas

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.340 
anyway so we write out our two formulas
again<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.480> time<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.780> mass<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
again but this time the mass of the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.580 
again but this time the mass of the
anchor<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.800> not<00:02:02.040> included<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.760> F<00:02:03.300> G<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.290> again

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
anchor is not included in F G so again

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.430 
anchor is not included in F G so again
some<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.160> forces<00:02:05.400> has<00:02:05.730> to<00:02:05.940> be<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.120> same<00:02:06.440> we

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
some of the forces has to be the same we

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.499 
some of the forces has to be the same we
write<00:02:07.650> them<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.070> we<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
write them out and we get that the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.570 
write them out and we get that the
volume<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.899> displaced<00:02:10.289> water<00:02:10.400> looks<00:02:11.400> very

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
volume of displaced water looks very

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.040 
volume of displaced water looks very
similar<00:02:11.820> but<00:02:11.970> we're<00:02:12.210> not<00:02:12.330> done<00:02:12.600> yet<00:02:12.630> there's<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
similar but we're not done yet there's a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.690 
similar but we're not done yet there's a
little<00:02:13.350> bit<00:02:13.470> more<00:02:13.740> water<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.220> displaced

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
little bit more water that's displaced

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090 
little bit more water that's displaced
just<00:02:15.480> from<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> volume<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> anchor<00:02:16.860> being

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
just from the volume of the anchor being

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.830 
just from the volume of the anchor being
inside<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> water<00:02:17.730> now<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.390> add<00:02:18.570> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
inside the water now so we just add that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.110 
inside the water now so we just add that
on<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.950> we're<00:02:20.280> good<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:20.760> let's<00:02:20.970> compare

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
on and we're good so now let's compare

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.699 
on and we're good so now let's compare
the<00:02:21.360> two<00:02:21.420> we've<00:02:21.630> got<00:02:21.660> situation<00:02:22.320> one<00:02:22.470> in

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
the two we've got situation one in

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.070 
the two we've got situation one in
situation<00:02:23.280> two<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.730> both<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.780> were

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
situation two and both of them were

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.330 
situation two and both of them were
trying<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.410> look<00:02:25.530> at<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> volume<00:02:26.190> of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
trying to look at the volume of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430 
trying to look at the volume of
displaced<00:02:26.850> water<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.930> we'll<00:02:28.080> break<00:02:28.230> those

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
displaced water and so we'll break those

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
displaced water and so we'll break those
down<00:02:28.470> into<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.160> solved<00:02:29.489> for<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.790> our<00:02:29.910> in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
down into what we solved for in our in

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.970 
down into what we solved for in our in
our<00:02:30.270> previous<00:02:30.660> equations<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.739> can't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
our previous equations and you can't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.530 
our previous equations and you can't
really<00:02:32.160> see<00:02:32.459> which<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.030> greater<00:02:33.300> right

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
really see which one is greater right

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.720 
really see which one is greater right
now<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:35.190> make<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.489> look<00:02:35.700> more

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
now and so to make it look more

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.979 
now and so to make it look more
apples-to-apples

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
apples-to-apples

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.190 
apples-to-apples
we'll<00:02:37.440> multiply<00:02:37.700> our<00:02:38.700> VA<00:02:38.970> over<00:02:39.239> there<00:02:39.480> by<00:02:39.780> row

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
we'll multiply our VA over there by row

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.280 
we'll multiply our VA over there by row
water<00:02:40.500> over<00:02:40.920> row<00:02:41.100> water<00:02:41.720> which<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.050> one

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
water over row water which is just one

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.410 
water over row water which is just one
but<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.100> makes<00:02:44.310> our<00:02:44.430> equation<00:02:44.790> look<00:02:44.940> much

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
but it makes our equation look much

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.360 
but it makes our equation look much
nicer<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.680> cancel<00:02:46.830> out<00:02:47.100> row

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
nicer and so now we can cancel out row

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.550 
nicer and so now we can cancel out row
water<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> bottom<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:49.020> both<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.440> can

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
water on the bottom of both and we can

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.770 
water on the bottom of both and we can
also<00:02:49.739> count<00:02:50.070> cancel<00:02:50.580> out<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.150> mass<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
also count cancel out the mass of the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.479 
also count cancel out the mass of the
boat<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.170> both<00:02:52.380> sides<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.400> just

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
boat on both sides and so now we just

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.010 
boat on both sides and so now we just
have<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.850> mass<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.270> anchor<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.600> one<00:02:54.780> side

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
have the mass of the anchor on one side

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.900 
have the mass of the anchor on one side
and<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.680> volume<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.160> anchor<00:02:56.430> times<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and the volume of the anchor times the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.970 
and the volume of the anchor times the
density<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.300> water<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.170> other<00:02:58.290> side<00:02:58.500> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
density of water on the other side it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.500 
density of water on the other side it's
still<00:02:59.070> kind<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> hard<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.910> which<00:03:00.090> side<00:03:00.330> is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
still kind of hard to see which side is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.960 
still kind of hard to see which side is
greater<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.500> let's<00:03:02.370> use<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.640> basic

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
greater and so let's use the basic

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.289 
greater and so let's use the basic
definition<00:03:03.480> density<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.620> mass<00:03:05.250> per<00:03:05.670> volume<00:03:05.700> or

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
definition density is mass per volume or

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
definition density is mass per volume or
in<00:03:06.540> other<00:03:06.660> words<00:03:06.870> mass<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.530> volume<00:03:08.100> times

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
in other words mass is volume times

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759 
in other words mass is volume times
density<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.480> we'll<00:03:09.630> take<00:03:09.780> our<00:03:09.989> our<00:03:10.200> mass<00:03:10.560> of

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
density so we'll take our our mass of

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.600 
density so we'll take our our mass of
our<00:03:10.830> anchor<00:03:11.130> there<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.959> replace<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.200> with

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
our anchor there and replace it with

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.430 
our anchor there and replace it with
volume<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> anchor<00:03:15.120> times<00:03:15.630> row<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
volume of the anchor times row of the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.280 
volume of the anchor times row of the
anchor<00:03:16.850> which<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> density<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.170> now

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
anchor which is the density and so now

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.539 
anchor which is the density and so now
we<00:03:19.350> see<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> volume<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> anchor<00:03:20.459> is

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
we see that the volume of the anchor is

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.160 
we see that the volume of the anchor is
on<00:03:20.670> both<00:03:20.790> sides<00:03:20.850> we<00:03:21.299> can<00:03:21.390> cancel<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
on both sides we can cancel that out and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.990 
on both sides we can cancel that out and
all<00:03:22.350> we<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.620> left<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.950> compare<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.489> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
all we have left to compare is the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060 
all we have left to compare is the
density<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> anchor<00:03:24.870> versus<00:03:25.590> density<00:03:26.010> of

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
density of the anchor versus density of

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.350 
density of the anchor versus density of
the<00:03:26.130> water<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.549> know<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.970> anchor<00:03:27.269> is

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
the water and we know that the anchor is

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.270 
the water and we know that the anchor is
more<00:03:27.540> dense<00:03:27.720> because<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.380> sinks<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.100> water

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
more dense because it sinks in the water

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.220 
more dense because it sinks in the water
and<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.850> since<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.239> left<00:03:30.420> side<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.959> is

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
and so since the left side of this is

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.080 
and so since the left side of this is
greater<00:03:31.530> than<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.860> right<00:03:32.040> side<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.850> means

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
greater than the right side that means

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.140 
greater than the right side that means
the<00:03:33.239> situation<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.140> displaces<00:03:35.130> more<00:03:35.400> water

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
the situation one displaces more water

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.630 
the situation one displaces more water
volume<00:03:36.600> than<00:03:37.019> situation<00:03:37.560> two<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.430> when

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
volume than situation two and so when

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.640 
volume than situation two and so when
the<00:03:38.700> anchor<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.090> dropped<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.870> now<00:03:40.079> displaces

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
the anchor is dropped it now displaces

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.110 
the anchor is dropped it now displaces
less<00:03:40.860> volume<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.430> therefore<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> water

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
less volume and therefore the water

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.000 
less volume and therefore the water
level<00:03:42.480> drops<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.380> that's<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> proof<00:03:43.829> if

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
level drops and so that's the proof if

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.650 
level drops and so that's the proof if
you<00:03:44.100> see<00:03:44.220> any<00:03:44.370> errors<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:44.700> my<00:03:44.910> logic<00:03:45.299> or<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.570> you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
you see any errors in my logic or if you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.729 
you see any errors in my logic or if you
have<00:03:45.750> any<00:03:45.870> questions<00:03:46.230> or<00:03:46.320> anything<00:03:46.470> just

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
have any questions or anything just

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.229 
have any questions or anything just
