00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.960
 5 artichokes that we cut a 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 pieces and after having cleaned and put them in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.140

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:27.050
 drain well, turn on the gas but 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:38.300
 extra virgin olive oil once the oil is 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.160
 the heat we put a small slice 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.770
 garlic you do to hurl 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:53.200
