00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.690
 at the tip of today's pencil went to the streets 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 to know what the doubts are about the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.320
 your money 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.330
 Let's check the series of knowing if 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.990
 saving money is good or 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.760
 bad 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.080
 The question is very pertinent. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 people asking what to do with my 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.970
 money that I have that I kept 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.000
 put in the savings do or some other 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 type of savings application is a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.420
 good option always although in the present day 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 she is fighting a lot with inflation 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 with inflation is how much your money 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.950
 will be on time or your money today 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.510
 Can you buy bread and tomatoes and potatoes? 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.180
 tomorrow as inflation is rising not 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.610
 You can buy the three more , that's why. 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 the inflation it in the present day it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.899
 hardly pays the best 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.059
 savings nowadays it 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.280
 practically does not pay inflation to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.440
 inflation is so high that what the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 banks offer income to pay 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.290
 informs to pay the savings do not beat the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.990
 inflation is like you get 100 you take 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.390
 money you have accumulated in places 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.049
 savings with high inflation the way 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 that is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.330
 We hope this changes but the way we 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.439
 is today it is at zero to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.270
 zero your money will be worth 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.000
 same thing in time 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.750
 now long-term savings is a good 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 option 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.210
 if you have a little money to bad 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.369
 so a little more than 500 thousand 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 I 'm seeing an example of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.259
 money to tell the next the money 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.090
 from day to day you will accumulate 50 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.259
 reais in reais two hundred reais is worth 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.600
 Worth putting in the savings 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.220
 at least you stay in the 0 to 0 but if 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.310
 You can get one thousand more money. 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200
 real 1,500 reais 2 thousand reais look for the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 Manager your bank ask him 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 ask premium what interest you are 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.720
 paying for that amount of money that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.799
 I have 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.950
 usually it can offer a cdb cd 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.290
 and some fixed income options that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.020
 serve your money better have other 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.270
 options and that we can talk about it in 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.370
 other programs but the savings 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.690
 Yes it's worth doing better than 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.750
 put the money lated 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.730
 the mattress and congratulations because the days 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.800
 it is easier to receive a question from 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.580
 how to pay off my debt than how 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.590
 pulp 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.150
 God bless you and bless you 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.400
