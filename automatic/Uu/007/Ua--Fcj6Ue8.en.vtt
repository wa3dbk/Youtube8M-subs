00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello dear friends with you Darga 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.970
 today will tell you how to play with 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.250
 modified 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:17.310
 cars in the game spintires multiplayer 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:19.250
 the system is quite complicated but i 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 I think you will immediately understand this 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.029
 here to begin with, I offer you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.720
 see what the game gives us when 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 already the mods are installed here in the game lice it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 protection that checks files 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.030
 if files do not match files 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.910
 original then it gives this error 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.020
 files are different from the original 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.480
 multiplayer game and achievement 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.140
 unavailable 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.539
 that is, this defense does not allow him to get 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 just multiplayer button locked 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.780
 what i suggest to do 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.670
 first you must have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.600
 on the computer is a pure game client without 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 modifications here is the default file and auto 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.040
 auto texture sounds are media folders 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.549
 zip 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.580
 here you are when you client clean this folder 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.759
 also purely proper you must her 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.740
 throw off 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.320
 copy here for sure too 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.240
 must be backed up 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 somewhere let's work on the desktop 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.180
 here you are copying 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.119
 and if your game is broken it is painted 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.159
 it was painted there then you will be 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.570
 backup files through which you 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.470
 You can restore the game without reuse 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.479
 downloading so let's say now I have 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.350
 there is a modification called nato jeep 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.680
 grand cherokee pioneer edishn this one 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.299
 my folder is now clean 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.900
 I simply copy files from it there with 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.240
 replacement naturally 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.259
 here 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.530
 with completely replace the heptyl folder and here 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.450
 the game we have now is pure 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.250
 I propose to do how to get around this 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.530
 protection we have to 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.260
 clean play attention clean play 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.610
 start first here we go mode 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.069
 steve game and we have steve play now 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.940
 unlocked what i suggest i do 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.299
 Now we will be running 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.250
 put a modification that is, it checks 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:42.829
 files game checks files at the moment 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.209
 run then she already check the files 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.099
 will not do and now we put this 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.099
 modification well, actually in the media folder 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.670
 just replacing files we throw everything 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:58.400
 here we copy by replacement now here we have 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.829
 It is set here do not unfortunately low 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.450
 play multiplayer friends not in 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.940
 network 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.299
 I'll show you just one in an empty room 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.440
 your friend is doing the same thing as me 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.750
 did you need to choose the coast because 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.250
 UAZ there immediately as it appears 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.770
 this jack place lasika are put 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.260
 and so here you are modifications 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.440
 running my multiplayer 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.510
 here your friend does the same 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.370
 connects to you like that either you or him 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.620
 there invite through steam or he to 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.180
 you yourself joins you should be 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.570
 necessarily the same modification 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.020
 actually that is what you are first 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.140
 start the vanilla version of the game then 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.700
 insert modification sit in the main 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.680
 menu when you put the modification attention 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.860
 even when the model is not just any 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.810
 loaded by car here and then 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.769
 already come multiplayer and play 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.810
 calm with friends 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:04.630
 here each time but by the way about 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.880
 I do not advise you to install machine modules 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.680
 module on machines in multiplayer in general 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.720
 because some of them don't work 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.360
 well here on this model work 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.900
 that 's it with the wheels there 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.359
 it works with repair parts there 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.880
 with trailers can your game fly out and 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.080
 then you will have to do everything 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.850
 completely from scratch 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.639
 that is, first 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.090
 replace files with original ones 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.100
 run the game and put a modification 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.750
 that's when 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.600
 But when you're with a friend played enough to 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.970
 out of the game all the next day you 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.880
 you need to do the same thing 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.820
 put u otherwise you just will not ascend 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.720
 you can not then multiplayer 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.720
 you do the same 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.460
 will take literally a minute maybe not 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.800
 I know, but without it, you are not like back 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.870
 multiplayer will not get here such 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.599
 there is a small joint with multiplayer 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.330
 nevertheless all the same in the game you can 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.900
 game you can play multiplayer as 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.840
 I played everything yesterday with my friend 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.710
 it was quiet but the modules and the machines 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.910
 I recommend you to put it well 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:26.030
 all about that I want to say 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.009
 Here the car is quietly working on the account 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.710
 I don’t know the cards I’ve been trying to find myself 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:35.569
 if all the same as it will happen to me 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.819
 do that for god's sake show him 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.930
 if all the same hands reach this 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.880
 what about the mods on the gearbox there on 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.669
 physicists changing there we have something that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.750
 bridges will break off here yours too 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.259
 friends put them 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.569
 and you put them that is the main thing that 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.250
 you fashion were the same if not 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.590
 equally this either from your friend 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.120
 crafting playing and you, too 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.250
 or someone with one of you but 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.370
 the moment he connects to 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.260
 your server is the main thing to fashion 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.820
 You had walls installed and not all 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.139
 then it ’s okay 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.030
 put fashion 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.750
