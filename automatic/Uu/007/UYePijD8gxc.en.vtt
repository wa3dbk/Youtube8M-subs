weeks<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.930> come<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.380> wasn't<00:00:51.650> too<00:00:51.680> long

there<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.890> she<00:01:43.890> uses<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.400> underneath<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
there and she uses it underneath a

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.120 
there and she uses it underneath a
foundation<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.660> her<00:01:46.380> skins<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:46.860> darker

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
foundation but her skins a bit darker

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
foundation but her skins a bit darker
than<00:01:47.220> mine<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.610> doesn't<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:47.970> match<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
than mine so it doesn't quite match and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.899 
than mine so it doesn't quite match and
so<00:01:49.530> she<00:01:49.590> puts<00:01:49.890> foundation<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> top<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so she puts foundation on the top so you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.180 
so she puts foundation on the top so you
can<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> primer<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.229> well<00:01:52.409> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
nice they only do this shape that I'm

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.170 
nice they only do this shape that I'm
aware<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:22.350> am<00:02:24.200> nw20<00:02:25.200> from<00:02:25.709> Mac<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.880> I'm

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
aware of and I am nw20 from Mac so I'm

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.130 
aware of and I am nw20 from Mac so I'm
pretty<00:02:27.540> pale<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:30.330> matches<00:02:30.720> me<00:02:30.840> quite

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
pretty pale and this matches me quite

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
pretty pale and this matches me quite
well<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.920> I'd<00:02:32.190> say<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.400> you've<00:02:32.549> got<00:02:32.760> much

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.000 
well so I'd say if you've got much
darker<00:02:33.420> skin<00:02:33.660> than<00:02:33.690> me<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:34.769> going<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
darker skin than me it's not going to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.440 
darker skin than me it's not going to
matter<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.400> then<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.329> could

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
matter but then you as well as you could

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.979
