at<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.309> bottom<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.480> need<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.660> pan<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.289> will

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
at the bottom you need a pan that will

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.080 
at the bottom you need a pan that will
close<00:00:54.649> completely<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.640> seal<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:58.789> trim

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
close completely and seal and you trim

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.380 
close completely and seal and you trim
the<00:00:59.270> end<00:00:59.890> stem<00:01:00.890> part<00:01:02.680> there<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:03.770> is

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
the end stem part there it is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.020 
depending on the size of the artichoke
it's<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.770> being<00:02:47.130> sure<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.400> they're<00:02:47.790> done

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
they'll leave will just pull off easily

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.880 
they'll leave will just pull off easily
like<00:03:04.560> this<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.420> you'll<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.989> meaty

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
sometimes the end will just come off

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.179 
sometimes the end will just come off
completely<00:04:45.030> that's<00:04:45.750> fine<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.259> long<00:04:46.710> as<00:04:46.919> it's

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
completely that's fine as long as it's

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.200 
completely that's fine as long as it's
not<00:04:47.599> woody<00:04:48.599> or<00:04:48.990> tough<00:04:49.229> in<00:04:49.500> your<00:04:49.620> mouth<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:51.060> can

eat it
okay<00:04:54.000> when<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.689> see<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.110> leaves<00:04:55.319> start<00:04:55.710> to

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
okay when you see the leaves start to

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.189 
okay when you see the leaves start to
bend<00:04:56.189> in<00:04:56.370> like<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:56.849> you're<00:04:57.210> very<00:04:57.659> close<00:04:57.930> to

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
bend in like this you're very close to

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.080 
bend in like this you're very close to
the<00:04:58.319> middle<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.830> sometimes<00:04:59.639> then<00:04:59.909> it's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
the middle and sometimes then it's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.709 
the middle and sometimes then it's
difficult<00:05:00.719> to<00:05:00.930> get<00:05:01.139> them<00:05:01.319> off<00:05:01.500> in<00:05:01.770> one<00:05:01.949> piece

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
difficult to get them off in one piece

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.689 
difficult to get them off in one piece
at<00:05:03.719> this<00:05:03.870> point<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.289> can<00:05:04.530> usually<00:05:05.009> bite<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
at this point you can usually bite the

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.300 
at this point you can usually bite the
the<00:05:06.360> complete<00:05:06.810> end<00:05:07.080> off<00:05:07.289> of<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.770> because

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
the complete end off of that because

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.360 
the complete end off of that because

this is a thistle so these aren't small

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.980 
this is a thistle so these aren't small
leaves<00:06:20.600> this<00:06:21.230> would<00:06:21.530> have<00:06:21.650> become<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:22.190> flower

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
leaves this would have become the flower

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
that you don't eat these because they

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.960 
that you don't eat these because they
