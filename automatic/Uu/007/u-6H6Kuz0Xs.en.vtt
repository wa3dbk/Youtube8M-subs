hello<00:00:10.059> my<00:00:10.179> name<00:00:10.330> is<00:00:10.360> Erica<00:00:10.719> Gauri<00:00:10.959> from<00:00:11.849> WWF

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
hello my name is Erica Gauri from WWF

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.330 
hello my name is Erica Gauri from WWF
build<00:00:13.090> smart<00:00:13.420> robots<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:14.199> this<00:00:15.009> is<00:00:15.160> the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
build smart robots and this is the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:23.189 
build smart robots and this is the
upgrade<00:00:15.969> to<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:18.810> hex<00:00:19.810> bug<00:00:20.820> packing<00:00:21.820> kit<00:00:22.199> so

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
upgrade to the hex bug packing kit so

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.589 
upgrade to the hex bug packing kit so
what<00:00:23.439> I've<00:00:23.560> done<00:00:23.710> is<00:00:23.770> I've<00:00:24.039> added<00:00:24.599> edge

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
what I've done is I've added edge

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:34.810 
what I've done is I've added edge
detectors

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.700 

you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.830 

these<00:00:42.550> keep<00:00:42.790> it<00:00:42.940> from<00:00:43.090> flying<00:00:43.360> off<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.660> edge

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
these keep it from flying off the edge

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.990 
these keep it from flying off the edge
of<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.140> table<00:00:44.290> or<00:00:44.559> whatever<00:00:44.710> so<00:00:45.430> there's<00:00:45.610> three

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
of a table or whatever so there's three

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.660 
of a table or whatever so there's three
these<00:00:46.960> will<00:00:47.110> also<00:00:47.230> be<00:00:47.440> able<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.710> be<00:00:48.219> used<00:00:48.399> for

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
these will also be able to be used for

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.819 
these will also be able to be used for
line<00:00:48.910> detection<00:00:49.530> although<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.559> haven't

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
line detection although I haven't

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.040 
line detection although I haven't
written<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.040> code<00:00:51.340> yet<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:52.329> in<00:00:52.540> this<00:00:52.690> example

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
written that code yet so in this example

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.619 
written that code yet so in this example
in<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.440> video<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:55.059> just<00:00:55.120> going<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.480> cover

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
in this video I'm just going to cover

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.810 
in this video I'm just going to cover
how<00:00:56.350> these<00:00:56.469> are<00:00:56.649> used<00:00:56.680> for<00:00:57.010> edge<00:00:57.129> detection<00:00:57.550> so

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
how these are used for edge detection so

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.340 
how these are used for edge detection so
when<00:00:57.970> it<00:00:58.059> when<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.510> detects<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:58.930> edge<00:00:59.079> of<00:00:59.260> the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
when it when it detects the edge of the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.630 
when it when it detects the edge of the
table<00:00:59.559> it'll<00:00:59.920> back<00:01:00.159> up<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.600> turn<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.519> know

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
table it'll back up and turn if you know

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.130 
table it'll back up and turn if you know
if<00:01:03.790> you<00:01:03.879> haven't<00:01:04.030> seen<00:01:04.269> this<00:01:04.420> robot<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:05.110> a

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
if you haven't seen this robot this is a

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.790 
if you haven't seen this robot this is a
hack<00:01:05.440> this<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.970> Hexbug<00:01:07.659> spider<00:01:08.500> and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
hack this is a the Hexbug spider and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.840 
hack this is a the Hexbug spider and
this<00:01:09.399> is<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.550> hack<00:01:09.850> where<00:01:09.880> I've<00:01:10.240> added<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:11.700> my<00:01:12.700> own

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
this is a hack where I've added a my own

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.359 
this is a hack where I've added a my own
board<00:01:13.210> here<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:13.960> from<00:01:14.140> again<00:01:14.530> WWF<00:01:15.160> build

smart<00:01:15.670> robots

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:34.429 

it's<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.689> microcontroller<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:27.570> motor<00:01:28.570> control

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.410 

right<00:01:35.439> now<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.549> sensors<00:01:37.000> are<00:01:37.179> turned

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
right now it's the sensors are turned

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.999 
right now it's the sensors are turned
off<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:37.869> running<00:01:38.200> off<00:01:38.350> but<00:01:38.590> they<00:01:38.740> all<00:01:38.799> ended

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
off it's running off but they all ended

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:49.169 
off it's running off but they all ended
up<00:01:39.130> cracking<00:01:39.369> smashing<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.759> can<00:01:48.850> see<00:01:49.030> they're

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
up cracking smashing you can see they're

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:56.490 
up cracking smashing you can see they're
detected<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.840> edge<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.100> backed<00:01:51.399> up<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:56.439> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
detected the edge and backed up by the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.309 
detected the edge and backed up by the
three<00:01:56.740> wires<00:01:56.950> hanging<00:01:57.250> out<00:01:57.490> from<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.729> back

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
three wires hanging out from the back

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.100 
three wires hanging out from the back
plug<00:01:59.319> into<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.860> TI<00:02:00.549> launchpad<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.899> can

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
plug into the TI launchpad so I can

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.380 
plug into the TI launchpad so I can
debug<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.799> program<00:02:03.220> codes<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:03.819> left<00:02:04.179> them<00:02:04.329> on

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
debug and program codes I left them on

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.190 
debug and program codes I left them on
there<00:02:04.569> because<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.780> thought<00:02:04.929> they<00:02:05.079> looked

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
there because I thought they looked

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.069 
there because I thought they looked
pretty<00:02:05.319> cool<00:02:05.649> almost<00:02:05.950> like<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.099> tail<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.990> the
