00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
simultaneously on screen which is the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.300 
simultaneously on screen which is the
best<00:01:10.659> way<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.869> play<00:01:11.140> these<00:01:11.290> games<00:01:11.350> like<00:01:12.130> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
best way to play these games like the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.190 
best way to play these games like the
other<00:01:12.490> top<00:01:12.820> line<00:01:13.090> shooters<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.689> trick<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
other top line shooters the trick is to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.980 
other top line shooters the trick is to
not<00:01:14.710> get<00:01:14.979> hit<00:01:15.250> by<00:01:15.430> anything<00:01:15.909> because<00:01:16.360> this<00:01:16.780> is

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
not get hit by anything because this is

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.840 
not get hit by anything because this is
an<00:01:17.079> unforgiving<00:01:17.710> game<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.340> your<00:01:18.460> spaceship

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
an unforgiving game and your spaceship

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.800 
an unforgiving game and your spaceship
will<00:01:19.030> explode<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:19.600> anything<00:01:20.079> touches<00:01:20.229> it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.870 

you<00:01:24.409> think<00:01:24.710> they<00:01:24.829> put<00:01:25.100> better<00:01:25.340> shields<00:01:25.759> on

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
you think they put better shields on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.130 
you think they put better shields on
those<00:01:26.060> things<00:01:26.329> but<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.689> makes<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.020> more

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
those things but that makes it more

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.240 
those things but that makes it more
challenging

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250
