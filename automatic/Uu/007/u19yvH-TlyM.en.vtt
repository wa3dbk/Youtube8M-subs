00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.509
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.400
 tricks today continue to consider 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.049
 minecraft model is not just mega 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.210
 super awesome from which i hope 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.320
 like you in advance like me if often 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.890
 really here what what are you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.350
 will make 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.939
 After all, the current mod adds to the game 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.099
 different kinds of dragons all of them we can 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.710
 ride on them and also this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 mod adds to the game different types of blocks 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.140
 and items and let us right now 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.420
 see how Dragon turns any 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.790
 types they are and so on well 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.579
 actually he vouches very easily 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.710
 we will need either iron or gold 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 either diamond is best dragon 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.329
 turns with diamond 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.280
 it turns a maximum from the second time 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 using diamond and let's right now 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 let's see how this whole thing looks 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.910
 right now how do you see the dragon on 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.110
 there are no horns but if we will 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.810
 tame something from him with 2 diamonds 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.479
 there are such gold rings and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.220
 damn it's cool something that is when we 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.720
 turn the dragon he appears 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.350
 at least some sign that we his 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.479
 tamed 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 and now we can ride it we 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.740
 just take click on it right 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.840
 click the saddle and we are on it 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.259
 ride we can fly by 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.860
 the gap we can go ahead we can 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.020
 go right left and so on proper 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.290
 the flight here is not as animated as 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 see he flaps his wings too weakly 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.460
 but still you imagine being in front 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 can travel the world on your own 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.659
 tame dragon like that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 let's better go down now 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.390
 the thing is, I want to consider this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.689
 mod completely and also this mod adds 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.829
 the game blocks only five types of blocks 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.070
 they symbolize the crystals then 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.890
 I mean , we have crystals on which 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.530
 dragons can be remembered for example we 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.290
 walking around the world la la la la la la la la walking 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 and found a bunch of such red ones 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.709
 crystals 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.780
 which means that on these red ones 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.850
 crystals can spawn lava buckets 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.340
 he and his feature will be 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.319
 that he will not burn in lava 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.120
 what is actually logical and proper 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.010
 dragons very much for example if we 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.140
 we will walk in the woods 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.510
 Spawn the forest dragon but now 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.280
 we started sleeping miner dragon 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.080
 it means that somewhere there 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.840
 below is mine 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.380
 and she is very close and let's get right 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.050
 now we will see what we can do 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.780
 with all these blocks of genes and so 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.410
 Further, well, in general, then we have such 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.370
 blocks 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.019
 they are called dark crystal and and you 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.030
 probably ask what with them 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.310
 you can do other than wait for now 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.010
 zaspavnen dragon on them and from them can be 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.110
 do the game the game is done like this 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.060
 way we will have it dark from the dark 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.910
 crystals and it's done like this 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.519
 way that is 4 crystal gift and we 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.760
 It turns out dark game and you probably 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.920
 ask why this dargham because he does not 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.200
 used in craft oh yes no really 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.110
 In fact, it is used in craft and for 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.060
 to make this gift work for us 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.850
 first you have to craft two more 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.100
 Crystal is our bloody game I mean 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.720
 bloody day he's done like this 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.700
 way and don't know some white 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.040
 I don't know how light is given 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.799
 excuse me people and it's done here 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.930
 in such a way that is quite logical 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.709
 the color is suitable for each other and now 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.780
 when we connect all these genes with us 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.290
 It may turn out such a powder 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.220
 and this powder we can connect here 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.820
 simple bottle and we succeed and 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.500
 shane death battle in which you can 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.890
 stuff the dragon 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.780
 and it's a little crazy or something, but still 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.880
 it really does appear with us 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.130
 Here's a magic to it, we butylek 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.989
 we can shove the dragon is done 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.810
 this way and as you can see right 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.090
 now we have a dragon in the bubble 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.539
 now this bottle is called full 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.639
 battle 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.360
 and when we walk the world and we will 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.530
 somewhere at night we will be attacked 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.830
 some zombies we just take 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.469
 throwing out your dragon and he will 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.379
 attack the zombies who attacked us well 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:36.800
 and actually here itself is just 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:39.139
 beautiful nai the most beautiful and me 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.360
 only one thing left to tell about him 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.560
 let's sleep right now 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.810
 pile-pile-pile pile-pile-pile 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.590
 bunch-bunch-bunch of different dragons 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.139
 then quit the game mode 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.270
 game mod off mode and now when we 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.930
 knock at least one not tamed 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.430
 the dragon will attack us a whole flock and she 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.139
 we will certainly attack 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.599
 all these dragons put on one 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.939
 little heart and i hope that you 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.610
 I liked this mod, I hope that you 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.210
 Like it was difficult 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.279
 remember 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.009
 maybe this mod i'm in suna 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.870
 global review after all this is probably 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.759
 It will do so and I have here some 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.830
 that you liked this mod and tell you 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.569
 if you are here for the first time then you can 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.599
 subscribe to channel like 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:27.250
 call friends and there was a spoon with you all 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.250
 good luck everyone bye
