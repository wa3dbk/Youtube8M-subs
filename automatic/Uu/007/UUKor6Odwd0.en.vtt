but<00:00:06.160> when<00:00:06.340> I<00:00:06.370> plan<00:00:06.549> to<00:00:06.580> do<00:00:06.759> in<00:00:06.880> the<00:00:06.940> future<00:00:07.090> that

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
but when I plan to do in the future that

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.030 
but when I plan to do in the future that
is<00:00:07.540> to<00:00:07.720> do<00:00:07.810> that<00:00:07.990> stand<00:00:08.290> to<00:00:08.380> take<00:00:08.559> I<00:00:08.770> know<00:00:08.889> I

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
is to do that stand to take I know I

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.459 
is to do that stand to take I know I
only<00:00:09.370> know<00:00:09.519> bits<00:00:09.790> and<00:00:10.000> pieces<00:00:10.389> of<00:00:10.629> the<00:00:11.230> stands

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
only know bits and pieces of the stands

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.369 
only know bits and pieces of the stands
for<00:00:11.650> parts<00:00:11.889> for<00:00:11.950> 27<00:00:12.940> but<00:00:13.299> i<00:00:13.450> think<00:00:13.809> i've<00:00:14.139> gained

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
for parts for 27 but i think i've gained

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.740 
for parts for 27 but i think i've gained
enough<00:00:14.650> knowledge<00:00:14.889> to<00:00:15.070> do<00:00:15.340> that<00:00:15.610> san<00:00:16.180> tag<00:00:16.420> and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
enough knowledge to do that san tag and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.960 
enough knowledge to do that san tag and
once<00:00:17.230> I<00:00:17.410> finally<00:00:17.740> catch<00:00:18.010> up<00:00:18.039> to<00:00:18.400> like<00:00:18.520> part<00:00:18.789> 8

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
once I finally catch up to like part 8

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.359 
once I finally catch up to like part 8
then<00:00:19.359> I'll<00:00:19.660> probably<00:00:19.900> redo<00:00:20.440> the<00:00:20.680> stand<00:00:20.980> tag

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
then I'll probably redo the stand tag

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.249 
then I'll probably redo the stand tag
again<00:00:21.550> I<00:00:21.910> also<00:00:22.330> plan<00:00:22.599> to<00:00:22.660> make<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:22.900> separate
