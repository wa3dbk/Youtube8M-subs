00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.260 

in<00:00:14.139> that<00:00:14.620> last<00:00:14.920> video<00:00:15.340> we<00:00:15.519> talked<00:00:15.700> about<00:00:15.760> flash

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
in that last video we talked about flash

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.970 
in that last video we talked about flash
and<00:00:16.630> ambient<00:00:17.110> light<00:00:17.230> balancing<00:00:17.740> for<00:00:17.950> a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
and ambient light balancing for a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.890 
and ambient light balancing for a
natural<00:00:18.340> effect<00:00:18.789> and<00:00:18.970> for<00:00:19.000> that<00:00:19.390> we're

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
natural effect and for that we're

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.690 
natural effect and for that we're
exposing<00:00:20.320> ambient<00:00:20.980> light<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.250> be<00:00:21.340> brighter

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
exposing ambient light to be brighter

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.120 
exposing ambient light to be brighter
and<00:00:21.939> we're<00:00:22.180> using<00:00:22.450> less<00:00:23.080> flash<00:00:23.650> power<00:00:23.919> so

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
and we're using less flash power so

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.260 
and we're using less flash power so
we're<00:00:24.220> being<00:00:24.369> more<00:00:24.550> subtle<00:00:24.880> with<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.000> flash

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
we're being more subtle with the flash

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.480 
we're being more subtle with the flash
let's<00:00:26.169> move<00:00:26.349> on<00:00:26.470> now<00:00:26.619> let's<00:00:26.829> talk<00:00:26.919> about<00:00:26.980> flash

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
let's move on now let's talk about flash

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.550 
let's move on now let's talk about flash
and<00:00:27.759> ambient<00:00:28.119> balancing<00:00:28.419> for<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.720> dramatic

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
and ambient balancing for a dramatic

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.189 
and ambient balancing for a dramatic
effect<00:00:29.980> in<00:00:30.039> our<00:00:30.160> images<00:00:30.460> well<00:00:31.420> basically<00:00:31.869> it's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
effect in our images well basically it's

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.810 
effect in our images well basically it's
the<00:00:32.349> exact<00:00:32.739> opposite<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:33.340> on<00:00:33.519> this<00:00:33.699> little

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
the exact opposite so on this little

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.009 
the exact opposite so on this little
scale<00:00:34.210> what<00:00:34.390> we're<00:00:34.510> doing<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:34.840> we're

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
scale what we're doing is we're

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.200 
scale what we're doing is we're
darkening<00:00:35.620> down<00:00:35.980> our<00:00:36.339> ambient<00:00:36.879> light<00:00:37.059> and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
darkening down our ambient light and

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.570 
darkening down our ambient light and
we're<00:00:37.690> brightening<00:00:38.350> up<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.980> flash<00:00:39.250> power

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
we're brightening up the flash power

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.939 
we're brightening up the flash power
okay<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:39.910> we're<00:00:40.150> using<00:00:40.269> more<00:00:40.600> flash<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.260> we're

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
okay so we're using more flash and we're

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.430 
okay so we're using more flash and we're
basically<00:00:42.120> under<00:00:43.120> exposing<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.960> ambient

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
basically under exposing the ambient

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.779 
basically under exposing the ambient
light<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:44.680> we<00:00:44.739> get<00:00:44.890> kind<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.100> a<00:00:45.190> darker<00:00:45.610> and

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
light so we get kind of a darker and

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.770 
light so we get kind of a darker and
more<00:00:45.910> dramatic<00:00:46.030> look<00:00:46.450> in<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.600> background

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
more dramatic look in the background

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.150 
more dramatic look in the background
that's<00:00:47.079> exactly<00:00:47.530> what<00:00:47.620> we<00:00:47.710> see<00:00:47.920> in<00:00:48.070> these

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
that's exactly what we see in these

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.340 
that's exactly what we see in these
images<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.329> let's<00:00:49.450> take<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.600> look<00:00:49.809> let's<00:00:50.020> talk

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
images so let's take a look let's talk

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.630

did was we put him in this area where we
could<00:01:13.330> actually<00:01:13.570> darken<00:01:14.200> down<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
could actually darken down the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.529 
could actually darken down the
environment<00:01:14.800> were<00:01:14.860> under<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.130> bridge<00:01:15.460> we<00:01:16.330> shot

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
environment were under a bridge we shot

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.770 
environment were under a bridge we shot
at<00:01:16.660> 150<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.229> second<00:01:17.590> at<00:01:17.710> F<00:01:17.950> 1.6<00:01:18.790> an<00:01:18.939> ISO<00:01:19.299> 200

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
at 150 of a second at F 1.6 an ISO 200

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.800 
at 150 of a second at F 1.6 an ISO 200
that<00:01:19.960> gives<00:01:20.170> us<00:01:20.320> our<00:01:20.470> ambient<00:01:21.070> light<00:01:21.250> exposure

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that gives us our ambient light exposure

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.120 
that gives us our ambient light exposure
we<00:01:22.810> look<00:01:23.080> at<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.530> say<00:01:23.650> okay<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:24.040> the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
we look at that and we say okay that the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.800 
we look at that and we say okay that the
background<00:01:24.369> looks<00:01:24.759> great<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.330> little<00:01:25.600> kiss

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
background looks great that little kiss

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.120 
background looks great that little kiss
of<00:01:25.960> light<00:01:26.110> on<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.320> left<00:01:26.500> side<00:01:26.619> looks<00:01:26.860> great

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
of light on the left side looks great

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.940 
of light on the left side looks great
now<00:01:27.310> all<00:01:27.520> we<00:01:27.640> need<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:27.850> do<00:01:27.939> is<00:01:28.119> add<00:01:28.360> our<00:01:28.570> flash

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
now all we need to do is add our flash

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.230 
now all we need to do is add our flash
well<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.400> we<00:01:30.520> want<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.850> more<00:01:31.030> dramatic

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
well because we want a more dramatic

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.770 
well because we want a more dramatic
look

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
look

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.350 
look
I<00:01:31.930> shot<00:01:32.290> Rembrandt<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.220> split<00:01:33.610> light<00:01:33.790> but<00:01:34.270> we

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
I shot Rembrandt and split light but we

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.609 
I shot Rembrandt and split light but we
shot<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.780> way<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.140> has<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.259> very<00:01:35.500> dramatic

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
shot that way so it has a very dramatic

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.530 
shot that way so it has a very dramatic
and<00:01:36.009> kind<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.220> dark<00:01:36.549> vibe<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.119> has<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> lot<00:01:37.509> of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
and kind of dark vibe it has a lot of

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.380 
and kind of dark vibe it has a lot of
shadow<00:01:37.900> which<00:01:38.710> gives<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.400> lot<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.700> dimension<00:01:40.270> to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
shadow which gives a lot of dimension to

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.999 
shadow which gives a lot of dimension to
that<00:01:40.420> kind<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.780> duality<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.710> kind<00:01:41.920> of

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
that kind of duality that that kind of

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.520 
that kind of duality that that kind of
split<00:01:42.759> personality<00:01:42.790> that<00:01:43.659> evil<00:01:43.990> versus<00:01:44.320> good

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
split personality that evil versus good

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.850 
split personality that evil versus good
type<00:01:44.740> thing<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:46.990> see<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.680> this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
type thing now you can see that this

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.090 
type thing now you can see that this
image<00:01:48.100> looks<00:01:48.579> far<00:01:49.119> more<00:01:49.420> dramatic<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.320> it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
image looks far more dramatic and it

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.609 
image looks far more dramatic and it
looks<00:01:51.399> kind<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.329> like<00:01:52.509> there's<00:01:53.049> definitely

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
looks kind of like there's definitely

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.080 
looks kind of like there's definitely
light<00:01:54.009> modification<00:01:54.579> there's<00:01:54.729> definitely

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
light modification there's definitely

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.179 
light modification there's definitely
flash<00:01:55.360> added<00:01:55.840> whereas<00:01:56.500> when<00:01:56.649> we<00:01:56.770> look<00:01:56.950> at<00:01:57.009> some

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
flash added whereas when we look at some

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.590 
flash added whereas when we look at some
of<00:01:57.250> those<00:01:57.340> previous<00:01:57.610> images<00:01:58.060> like<00:01:58.420> for

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
of those previous images like for

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080 
of those previous images like for
example<00:01:58.689> if<00:01:59.079> we<00:01:59.170> look<00:01:59.200> over<00:01:59.439> here<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.939> really

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
example if we look over here you really

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.789 
example if we look over here you really
don't<00:02:01.329> know<00:02:01.509> that<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:01.930> flashed<00:02:02.439> you

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
don't know that this is flashed you

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.990 
don't know that this is flashed you
don't<00:02:02.950> really<00:02:03.219> know<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.759> flashed

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
don't really know that this is flashed

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.910 
don't really know that this is flashed
or<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.630> flash<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.990> looks<00:02:05.170> like<00:02:05.350> we

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
or that this is flash it looks like we

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.499 
or that this is flash it looks like we
might<00:02:06.159> have<00:02:06.310> had<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.430> reflector<00:02:06.969> or<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.329> looks

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
might have had a reflector or it looks

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.449 
might have had a reflector or it looks
like<00:02:07.570> just<00:02:07.869> natural<00:02:08.200> light<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
like just natural light and that's the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.880 
like just natural light and that's the
difference<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.149> over<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:10.989> these<00:02:11.769> are

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
difference is that over here these are

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.560 
difference is that over here these are
gonna<00:02:12.010> feel<00:02:12.370> dramatic<00:02:12.910> they're<00:02:13.090> gonna<00:02:13.180> feel

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
gonna feel dramatic they're gonna feel

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.509 
gonna feel dramatic they're gonna feel
more<00:02:13.959> punchy<00:02:14.440> because<00:02:14.799> we're<00:02:14.890> pulling<00:02:15.310> down

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
more punchy because we're pulling down

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.180 
more punchy because we're pulling down
that<00:02:15.940> background<00:02:16.750> exposure<00:02:17.110> let's<00:02:18.010> look<00:02:18.130> at

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
that background exposure let's look at

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.120 
that background exposure let's look at
the<00:02:18.250> next<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.549> here<00:02:19.360> we're<00:02:19.630> at<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.870> 200<00:02:20.230> at<00:02:20.980> F

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the next one here we're at one 200 at F

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.580 
the next one here we're at one 200 at F
5.6<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:21.940> ISO<00:02:22.180> 100<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> Sun<00:02:22.870> had<00:02:23.079> just<00:02:23.109> set

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
5.6 and ISO 100 the Sun had just set

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.420 
5.6 and ISO 100 the Sun had just set
behind<00:02:23.949> her<00:02:24.040> head

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
behind her head

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.099 
behind her head
again<00:02:25.000> we'll<00:02:25.120> talk<00:02:25.269> more<00:02:25.329> about<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> details

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
again we'll talk more about the details

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.120 
again we'll talk more about the details
later<00:02:26.290> on<00:02:26.440> we're

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
later on we're

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.270 
later on we're
balancing<00:02:27.430> for<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.690> CTO<00:02:29.650> gel<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:30.160> we're

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
balancing for a CTO gel so we're

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920 
balancing for a CTO gel so we're
balancing<00:02:30.670> at<00:02:30.790> 3600<00:02:31.420> Kelvin<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
balancing at 3600 Kelvin so the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.300 
balancing at 3600 Kelvin so the
background<00:02:32.290> looks<00:02:32.410> completely<00:02:32.830> blue

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
background looks completely blue

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.860 
background looks completely blue
we've<00:02:33.580> darkened<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.120> down<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:34.600> nice<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
we've darkened it down so it's nice and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.830 
we've darkened it down so it's nice and
dark<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.620> we<00:02:35.710> add<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> lot<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.400> flash<00:02:36.790> punch<00:02:37.180> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
dark and we add a lot of flash punch to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.790 
dark and we add a lot of flash punch to
get<00:02:37.990> her<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.260> pop<00:02:38.410> out

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
get her to pop out

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.470 
get her to pop out
notice<00:02:39.430> how<00:02:39.520> in<00:02:39.640> each<00:02:39.850> one<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.060> these<00:02:40.180> scenes

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
notice how in each one of these scenes

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.680 
notice how in each one of these scenes
before<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.710> add<00:02:41.860> flash<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:43.120> subject<00:02:43.570> is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
before we add flash the subject is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.380 
before we add flash the subject is
almost<00:02:43.960> pitch<00:02:44.230> black<00:02:44.700> whereas<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
almost pitch black whereas in the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.010 
almost pitch black whereas in the
previous<00:02:46.510> slide<00:02:48.150> before<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.240> added<00:02:49.390> flash<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
previous slide before we added flash the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.500 
previous slide before we added flash the
subject<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.530> looks<00:02:50.740> slightly<00:02:51.510> underexposed

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
subject just looks slightly underexposed

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.110 
subject just looks slightly underexposed
just<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.110> little<00:02:53.320> bit<00:02:53.440> okay<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.460> that's<00:02:54.940> how<00:02:55.030> you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
just a little bit okay so that's how you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.460 
just a little bit okay so that's how you
know<00:02:55.360> we're<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:56.020> dramatic<00:02:56.410> effect

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
know we're going for dramatic effect

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.310 
know we're going for dramatic effect
versus<00:02:57.340> for<00:02:57.820> very<00:02:58.270> soft<00:02:58.630> natural<00:02:58.870> effect

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
versus for very soft natural effect

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.980 
versus for very soft natural effect
because<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.340> base<00:03:00.940> exposure<00:03:01.480> leaves<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
because the base exposure leaves the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.490 
because the base exposure leaves the
subject<00:03:02.350> basically<00:03:02.620> completely<00:03:03.100> in<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.400> dark

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
subject basically completely in the dark

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.050 
subject basically completely in the dark
so<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:05.740> ambient<00:03:06.040> flash<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.580> again<00:03:06.910> that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
so with ambient flash this is again that

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.460 
so with ambient flash this is again that
gelled<00:03:07.390> flash<00:03:07.660> that's<00:03:07.840> bouncing<00:03:08.290> off<00:03:08.440> a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
gelled flash that's bouncing off a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.980 
gelled flash that's bouncing off a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430

thing<00:03:22.600> here<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:22.960> we<00:03:23.050> get<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.350> nice

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
thing here so we get that nice

thing here so we get that nice
background<00:03:24.280> shot<00:03:24.490> with<00:03:24.670> every<00:03:25.030> one<00:03:25.150> these

background shot with every one these

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.420 
background shot with every one these
situations<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:26.320> approach<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.860> exact<00:03:27.310> same

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430

situations we approach it the exact same
way<00:03:27.820> we<00:03:28.210> would<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> natural<00:03:29.380> setup<00:03:29.650> we

approach<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.700> scene<00:03:30.880> we<00:03:31.630> decide<00:03:31.960> what<00:03:32.410> we

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
approach the scene we decide what we

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
want that scene to look like do I want

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.970 
want that scene to look like do I want

to look bright and natural and airy with
the<00:03:36.580> exposure<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.150> background<00:03:37.210> or<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
the exposure of the background or do I

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.390 
the exposure of the background or do I
want<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.140> look<00:03:38.260> dark<00:03:38.560> I'll<00:03:38.770> take<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.130> test

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
want to look dark I'll take it a test

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.180 
want to look dark I'll take it a test
shot<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:39.880> kind<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.540> decide<00:03:40.780> what<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:40.960> want<00:03:41.230> then

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
shot and kind of decide what I want then

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.470 
shot and kind of decide what I want then
after<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.820> decide<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:43.210> I<00:03:43.240> want<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
after I decide what I want the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.090 
after I decide what I want the
background<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.960> look<00:03:44.110> like<00:03:44.290> I'd<00:03:44.530> add<00:03:44.740> my<00:03:44.890> life

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
background to look like I'd add my life

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.830 
background to look like I'd add my life
so<00:03:45.460> again<00:03:45.730> right<00:03:46.120> here<00:03:46.300> we're<00:03:46.450> bouncing<00:03:46.750> off

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
so again right here we're bouncing off

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.990 
so again right here we're bouncing off
of<00:03:46.960> silver<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.440> we're<00:03:48.310> sending<00:03:48.550> light<00:03:48.790> right

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
of silver and we're sending light right

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.040 
of silver and we're sending light right
into<00:03:49.150> her<00:03:49.210> face<00:03:49.390> which<00:03:49.600> gives<00:03:49.810> us<00:03:49.900> this

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
into her face which gives us this

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.590 
into her face which gives us this
beautiful<00:03:50.260> kind<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.160> darkened<00:03:51.700> down<00:03:51.880> sunset

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
beautiful kind of darkened down sunset

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.140 
beautiful kind of darkened down sunset
shot<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:52.960> the<00:03:53.080> Sun<00:03:53.290> sets<00:03:53.560> over<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.980> desert<00:03:54.310> all

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
shot as the Sun sets over the desert all

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.300 
shot as the Sun sets over the desert all
right<00:03:55.300> so<00:03:55.450> flash<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.140> ambient<00:03:56.830> balancing<00:03:57.160> for

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
right so flash and ambient balancing for

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.730 
right so flash and ambient balancing for
dramatic<00:03:57.670> effects<00:03:57.970> simply<00:03:58.240> means<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:59.080> we're

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
dramatic effects simply means that we're

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.470 
dramatic effects simply means that we're
taking<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.250> ambient<00:04:00.670> light<00:04:00.790> down<00:04:01.120> we're

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
taking the ambient light down we're

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.050 
taking the ambient light down we're
generally<00:04:01.840> gonna<00:04:01.990> under<00:04:02.440> expose<00:04:03.060> ambient

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
generally gonna under expose ambient

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.150 
generally gonna under expose ambient
light<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.330> we<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.600> lots<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.500> color<00:04:05.860> and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
light so we have lots of color and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.340 
light so we have lots of color and
background<00:04:06.700> detail<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.780> we're<00:04:07.959> taking<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
background detail and we're taking the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.380 
background detail and we're taking the
flash<00:04:08.620> power<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.250> we're<00:04:09.760> bringing<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.180> up

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
flash power and we're bringing it up

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.530 
flash power and we're bringing it up
that's<00:04:11.260> like<00:04:11.470> up<00:04:11.620> like<00:04:11.770> two<00:04:12.010> thumbs<00:04:12.250> up<00:04:12.540> two

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
that's like up like two thumbs up two

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.840 
that's like up like two thumbs up two
thumbs<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.959> for<00:04:14.410> dramatic<00:04:14.770> effect<00:04:14.830> all<00:04:15.700> right

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
thumbs up for dramatic effect all right

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.810 
thumbs up for dramatic effect all right
let's<00:04:16.120> head<00:04:16.180> on<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.330> the<00:04:16.420> next<00:04:16.480> video
