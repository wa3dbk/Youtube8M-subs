You're My Home

00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:28.546
Soothing me on a hard day

00:00:29.443 --> 00:00:36.442
The only one who hugs my tired shoulders

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:43.586
When everyone leaves me

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.714
The one who will stay in place

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:55.499
The only one who won't change and protect me

00:00:58.153 --> 00:01:01.666
Breezy window side

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:06.322
Warm blanket

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:12.380
My lullaby through the night

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.717
A haven better than the dreams

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:19.197
The most comfortable place

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:25.626
I don't want to leave, you're my home

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:39.361
My entire day

00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:47.153
The only one I can share it with

00:01:47.153 --> 00:01:55.200
Wherever I go

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.297
A place I can return to

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:05.366
The only one who won't change and wait for me

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:08.885
Breezy window side

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:13.150
Warm blanket

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.285
My lullaby through the night

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:22.774
A haven better than the dreams

00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:26.261
The most comfortable place

00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:32.444
I don't want to leave, you're my home

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:40.126
You came to me and became my home

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:44.541
I'll be with you always

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:54.388
I'll keep the light on, I'll protect you

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:58.228
No matter how far

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:01.628
How far I may be

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:07.868
A home I'll return to some day

00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:12.228
In your arms

00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:16.246
I'll be

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:23.870
A haven better than the dreams
The most comfortable place

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:30.317
I don't want to leave, you're my home

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:52.463
