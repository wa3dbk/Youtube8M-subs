in to the top so you can see which will

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.730 
in to the top so you can see which will
just<00:01:38.700> finish<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.320> we'll<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.310> two

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
three so you can hope for see that their

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.319 
three so you can hope for see that their
galaxy<00:01:48.600> nexus<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> finished<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> LG<00:01:51.060> just

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
galaxy nexus is finished and the LG just

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.210 
galaxy nexus is finished and the LG just
finished<00:01:51.600> after<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.979> case

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
finished after it so in that case

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
finished after it so in that case
they're<00:01:53.549> obviously<00:01:54.329> Galaxy<00:01:54.750> Nexus<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
they're obviously Galaxy Nexus is the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.359 
they're obviously Galaxy Nexus is the
winner<00:01:56.090> see<00:01:57.090> which<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.390> gives<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> bit<00:01:57.810> for

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369

winner see which one gives you a bit for
smoother<00:01:59.369> performance<00:01:59.579> on<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> tor<00:02:00.420> browser

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
smoother performance on that tor browser

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
smoother performance on that tor browser
itself<00:02:02.570> in<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.530> case<00:02:04.770> y<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.369> see

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
itself in this case y as you can see

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.990 
itself in this case y as you can see
clearly<00:02:06.000> does<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> Galaxy<00:02:07.049> Nexus<00:02:08.000> now

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
clearly does go to the Galaxy Nexus now

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880 
clearly does go to the Galaxy Nexus now
again<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.780> running<00:02:09.989> Android<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.619> this

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
again this is running Android for this

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
again this is running Android for this
round<00:02:11.129> Roy<00:02:11.340> 2.3<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.270> Ice<00:02:12.420> Cream<00:02:12.720> Sandwich

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
round Roy 2.3 so Ice Cream Sandwich

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
round Roy 2.3 so Ice Cream Sandwich
Virginia

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
Virginia

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.870 
Virginia
so<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.670> different

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
so there is going to be different

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.340 
so there is going to be different
obviously<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> browser<00:02:15.630> performance<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
obviously in the browser performance of

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.440 
obviously in the browser performance of
such<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:17.490> we're<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.030> we'll<00:02:18.270> go<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
such what we're going to now we'll go to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.090 
such what we're going to now we'll go to
the<00:02:18.600> verge

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.560 

so<00:02:22.100> once<00:02:22.550> again<00:02:22.700> we're<00:02:23.000> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.270> see<00:02:23.390> which

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
so once again we're going to see which

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.350 
so once again we're going to see which
one<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> verge<00:02:24.470> quicker<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.730> one

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
one can get to the verge quicker so one

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.770 
one can get to the verge quicker so one
two<00:02:26.930> three<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:28.940> if<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.060> go<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.330> same<00:02:29.540> thing

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
two three see if I go to the same thing

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.980 
two three see if I go to the same thing
again<00:02:34.030> ever<00:02:35.030> had<00:02:35.240> I<00:02:35.270> want<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> show<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.840> what

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
again ever had I want to show you what

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.140 
again ever had I want to show you what
that<00:02:36.020> one<00:02:36.230> kind<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.590> me<00:02:36.770> kind<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.220> garba

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
that one kind of me kind of a garba

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
that one kind of me kind of a garba
messed<00:02:38.360> up<00:02:38.570> there<00:02:38.960> roughly<00:02:39.290> about<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.530> same

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
messed up there roughly about the same

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.040 
messed up there roughly about the same
time<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.550> anything<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:41.720> even<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
time if anything then I think even the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.340 
time if anything then I think even the
that<00:02:43.010> all<00:02:43.220> proud<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:44.660> so

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
that all proud to have on that one so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.840 
that all proud to have on that one so
you<00:02:45.410> see<00:02:45.560> which<00:02:45.710> one's<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.010> bit<00:02:46.130> smoother<00:02:46.610> again

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you see which one's a bit smoother again

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.360 
you see which one's a bit smoother again
it's<00:02:46.970> scrolling<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.740> massive<00:02:49.160> amount

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
it's scrolling not on massive amount

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.280 
it's scrolling not on massive amount
difference<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.820> this<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.300> does<00:02:51.140> this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
difference in this one and does this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.220 
difference in this one and does this
stuff<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.740> page<00:02:51.920> work<00:02:52.480> yes<00:02:53.480> he<00:02:53.630> does<00:02:53.840> does

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
stuff on the page work yes he does does

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.640 
stuff on the page work yes he does does
this<00:02:54.320> one<00:02:54.500> work<00:02:55.330> yes<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.510> does<00:02:56.720> I'll<00:02:57.380> cause

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
this one work yes it does I'll cause

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.870 
this one work yes it does I'll cause
that<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:01.040> we're<00:03:01.160> going<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.340> go<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.640> full

that 12 urges website so i was going to
give<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.280> quick<00:03:49.400> scrub<00:03:49.790> formal<00:03:50.180> since<00:03:50.300> when

give you a quick scrub formal since when

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.100 
give you a quick scrub formal since when
is<00:03:50.540> our<00:03:50.720> see<00:03:50.900> which<00:03:51.050> one<00:03:51.260> is<00:03:51.440> bad<00:03:51.680> performs<00:03:52.160> bar

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.990 

so<00:03:57.130> again<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.160> think<00:03:58.280> you'll<00:03:58.580> see<00:03:58.790> that<00:03:58.880> the

so again I think you'll see that the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.280 
so again I think you'll see that the
Galaxy<00:03:59.390> Nexus<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.050> case<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:02.110> if<00:04:03.110> it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
Galaxy Nexus in this case here if it

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.520 
Galaxy Nexus in this case here if it
wants<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.530> flake<00:04:04.630> is<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.690> much<00:04:05.989> smoother

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
wants to flake is a much smoother

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.340 
wants to flake is a much smoother
