00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 while 6 pro nelli is always a good one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 sorry to ward off bad thoughts 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.560
 of mind relax 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 better still if then our idea 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.940
 prepare a sanna beverage of domains a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 say hello that today I have prepared a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.960
 wonderful spin and mine 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.330
 thought is to prepare a great one 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 then soy milk milk 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 we are going to flavor with bananas not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.060
 I know how to send them back 50 grams 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 of yellow soybeans a liter of water 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.270
 50 grams of hazelnuts a banana 100 g 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.079
 of pulp a pinch of salt and a piece 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.969
 kombu seaweed two dates to prepare the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 We have flavored soy milk 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.309
 started the night before what I have 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.530
 done 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 I started with yellow soybeans 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.289
 dry obviously I put them in soak 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.250
 for 6 10 hours ok then I rinsed them 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.100
 to remove all the elements 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.920
 anti-nutritional and invited eo 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 boiled the threshold for about an hour e 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 half with a pinch of salt and a piece 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 kombu seaweed which is a source of glutamate 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 monosodium a good disability enhancer 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 so this is the result and this is it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 the cooking liquid I kept from 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 part and I let them cool then 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 what I did was the hazelnuts and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.610
 I put them in soak to do them well 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 soften because then we will go to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 crush to remove the juice from everyone 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.759
 our ingredients that we have before 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.820
 listed with the juice extractor a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.009
 cold then or peeled the banana are 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.500
 100 g of clean pulp is here or 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.979
 pitted the dates and cut into 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.890
 pieces 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.590
 now we can extract all the juices 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.689
 if you don't have the centrifuge what you do 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.100
 you can blend everything with the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.960
 immersion mixer or with the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 founder ab shooting and then filter it 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.899
 through a sieve lined with a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.899
 dishtowel point 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.870
 so we quickly got the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.330
 our very own soy milk 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.280
 without lactose and without cholesterol 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.410
 this is the texture I like 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.520
 so rather velvety but if not 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.530
 you want more free 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.039
 add even more cooking liquid 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.390
 or simple water if this ends rover 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.150
 we are inside a glass 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.940
 we can consume it immediately I recommend 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.160
 to keep it in the fridge for as long as possible 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.590
 for a day because the principles 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.670
 active ones oxidize above all those 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.620
 in the banana 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.480
 if you want to keep it even more 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.580
 long you can freeze it or 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.070
 pasteurized just like you do with le 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.230
 jams and ideal to accompany with 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.360
 some biscuits maybe vegan vi 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.690
 I recommend my cookies with flour 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.690
 of hemp
