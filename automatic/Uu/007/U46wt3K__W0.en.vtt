00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 pio 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.150
 ae 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.210
 today has not had a chance yet to see the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.650
 image of your child, right? 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.050
 Not yet but I already spoke with the wife. 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.070
 I sent a hug to her, everyone 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.990
 very happy 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.960
 Think of the time you saw the game. 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.790
 it was over there is the will that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.100
 I'll finish soon so we can hear the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.980
 shout and take all the joy with the fans 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.800
 that supported us so much and was the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.920
 Nothing. Nothing to you. Always sambinha. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.100
 In the foundation, samba is the only 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.810
 they did not have our pagoda's pagoda pagoda 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.250
 in the year to walk us deliver 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:37.130
 here for the muse of the Brazilian national team 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:41.300
 tends to weigh even more of its moment 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.899
 but in a football today is the moment 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:50.840
 most unforgettable was the final whistle in 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:53.800
 2002 was the realization of a dream of 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.040
 child being world champion 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.960
 Who are you to whom you're going to cheer up? 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:06.760
 In this cup, beyond Brazil, beyond Brazil. 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.100
 It's when Brazil can not make it. It's me. 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.590
 I pray for Germany because it is a country 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.680
 where I lived a long time two children 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.740
 my were born there and also very twisted 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:27.840
 through germany 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.840
 then after Brazil is german ralf otte 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.700
 and that what you think of the defense of 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.150
 Brazilian selection and also the selection 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.150
 from Germany 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.470
 Then I believe that the Brazil team 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.210
 defense of our selection is much more 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.260
 than the selection of the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.410
 Germany 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.650
 This is an advantage that Brazil has 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.530
 very big disadvantage of Germany the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.340
 germany's defensive sector 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 I do not think it's one of the best in 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 comparison to the attack the field 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.630
 Germany 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:13.360
 the defense was a bit to be desired in 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.680
 comparison to Brazil is better than this 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.099
 year 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:25.230
 there is no portugal cristiano ronaldo 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:29.670
 is also one of the biggest players in the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.819
 world but alone is it complicated, I 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.829
 I believe that if his companions 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.590
 of them followed the rhythm of Portugal 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.650
 also can arrive with force is that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.030
 nobody expects but he alone will be 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.090
 difficult middle of the port of portugal and non 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.139
 ti is the best forward as here or 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.709
 everything is possible to the contrary 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:04:01.680
 I believe or messi 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:08.090
 when it was in 2000 and 2010 in the late 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:14.549
 Tim kring a for them is a very player 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:18.690
 fast fast versatile and skillful does 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.829
 very many goals so is it was more 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.829
 Difficult that I faced 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:29.879
 Do you think the first is to be champion? 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.580
 This year I believe until the end more 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:38.460
 we know we still have an end 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:43.259
 improve significantly, especially in 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:49.199
 after the cup we can not lose 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:53.129
 some games like we lost and to be 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:56.009
 champion is must have something more than 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:59.750
 that we still can not reach 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.750
 in this first step
