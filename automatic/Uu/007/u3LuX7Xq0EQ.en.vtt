00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
entire egg in one go just add little by

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
entire egg in one go just add little by
little<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> way<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.260> mixture<00:00:43.620> will<00:00:43.800> not

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
little that way this mixture will not

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.850 
little that way this mixture will not
curdle<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> add<00:00:45.239> orange<00:00:45.899> essence<00:00:46.469> if

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
curdle now in this add orange essence if

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
curdle now in this add orange essence if
you<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.610> orange<00:00:48.059> essence<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.750> can

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you do not have orange essence you can

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.670 
you do not have orange essence you can
also<00:00:49.110> add<00:00:49.379> almond<00:00:49.860> essence<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.879> add<00:00:51.680> 225

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
also add almond essence in this add 225

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.400 
also add almond essence in this add 225
grams<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.100> flour<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.809> mix<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> nice

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
grams of flour and mix this to a nice

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.830 
grams of flour and mix this to a nice
smooth<00:00:55.980> consistency<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.750> going

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
smooth consistency because we are going

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.439 
smooth consistency because we are going
to<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.039> piping<00:00:59.430> one<00:01:00.149> has<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to use this for piping one has to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
to use this for piping one has to
understand<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> piping

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
understand what is the piping

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
understand what is the piping
consistency<00:01:02.760> see<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.780> too<00:01:04.110> thick

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
consistency see if this is too thick

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.620 
consistency see if this is too thick
then<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.460> able<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.820> pipe<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
then you will not be able to pipe if it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.590 
then you will not be able to pipe if it
is<00:01:06.750> too<00:01:07.260> soft<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.850> cookies<00:01:09.180> won't<00:01:09.420> come

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
is too soft then the cookies won't come

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
is too soft then the cookies won't come
out<00:01:09.750> good<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.549> too<00:01:11.820> thick<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.090> can

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
out good so if it is too thick you can

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
out good so if it is too thick you can
always<00:01:12.360> add<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> little<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> beaten<00:01:14.220> egg

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
always add a little more of a beaten egg

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.940 
always add a little more of a beaten egg
into<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> follow<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> recipe<00:01:16.020> more

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
into this if you follow the recipe more

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
into this if you follow the recipe more
or<00:01:17.100> less<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.729> perfect<00:01:18.330> piping

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
or less you will get perfect piping

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
or less you will get perfect piping
consistency<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.650> sometimes<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
consistency but sometimes if you use a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
consistency but sometimes if you use a
smaller<00:01:21.600> egg<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.439> dough<00:01:22.619> may<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.890> slightly

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
smaller egg the dough may be slightly

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
smaller egg the dough may be slightly
tough<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.930> beat<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> eggs

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
tough then just beat little more of eggs

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.370 
tough then just beat little more of eggs
and<00:01:26.100> add<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> mix<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> nice

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and add to this and mix it to a nice

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.649 
and add to this and mix it to a nice
piping<00:01:28.890> consistency<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> piping<00:01:30.630> bag

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
piping consistency now take a piping bag

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.100 
piping consistency now take a piping bag
and<00:01:31.220> these<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.210> disposable<00:01:33.900> kind

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and these are very good disposable kind

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
and these are very good disposable kind
of<00:01:34.229> piping<00:01:34.530> bags<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.060> fill<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.240> mixture

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of piping bags and fill this mixture

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.800 
of piping bags and fill this mixture
inside<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.140> sometimes<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.250> find<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.700> easy<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
inside this sometimes I find it easy to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.289 
inside this sometimes I find it easy to
take<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.350> piping<00:01:40.890> bag<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> jig<00:01:42.119> like

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
take this piping bag into a jig like

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.620 
take this piping bag into a jig like
this<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.189> spread<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> piping<00:01:44.670> bag<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this and spread the piping bag on the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
this and spread the piping bag on the
rim<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.229> jug<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.310> fill<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.270> up

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
rim of this jug and then fill this up

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
rim of this jug and then fill this up
because<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:49.229> transparent<00:01:49.920> piping<00:01:50.430> bag

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because they are transparent piping bag

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.210 
because they are transparent piping bag
you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> also<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.750> any<00:01:51.930> air<00:01:52.170> gaps<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> then

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
you can also see any air gaps and then

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.940 
you can also see any air gaps and then
just<00:01:53.729> twist<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.659> top<00:01:54.840> edges<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:55.829> you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
just twist the top edges and then you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
just twist the top edges and then you
will<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.189> able<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.520> pipe<00:01:57.240> them<00:01:57.450> easily<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
will be able to pipe them easily and in

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.550 
will be able to pipe them easily and in
a<00:01:58.740> circular<00:01:58.979> motion<00:01:59.280> just<00:02:00.210> pipe<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
a circular motion just pipe it if the
