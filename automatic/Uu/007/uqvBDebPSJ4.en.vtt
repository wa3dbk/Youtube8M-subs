want to give it to me I've been doing
the<00:03:59.430> same<00:03:59.579> type<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.910> packs<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:01.739> could<00:04:01.859> be

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
the same type of packs and that could be

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.380 
the same type of packs and that could be
the<00:04:01.980> reason<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.459> haven't<00:04:02.609> done<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.850> whole<00:04:03.030> lot<00:04:03.209> of

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the reason I haven't done a whole lot of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.699 
the reason I haven't done a whole lot of
silver<00:04:03.569> packs<00:04:03.870> at<00:04:04.019> all<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.140> probably<00:04:04.380> should

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
silver packs at all I probably should

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.360 
silver packs at all I probably should
but<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.940> just<00:04:06.150> don't<00:04:06.540> want<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.799> be<00:04:07.889> perfectly

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
but I just don't want to to be perfectly

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.890 
but I just don't want to to be perfectly
honest<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.880> don't<00:04:08.940> care<00:04:09.090> about<00:04:09.209> silver<00:04:09.630> cards

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
honest I don't care about silver cards

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.379 
honest I don't care about silver cards
yet<00:04:10.319> I've<00:04:10.470> not<00:04:10.739> made<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.250> silver<00:04:11.850> team<00:04:12.090> I'm

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
yet I've not made a silver team I'm

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.300 
yet I've not made a silver team I'm
terrified<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.440> silver<00:04:13.739> teams<00:04:13.950> because

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
terrified of the silver teams because

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.590 
terrified of the silver teams because
their<00:04:14.579> touch<00:04:14.819> is<00:04:15.060> going<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.269> probably<00:04:15.450> be

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
their touch is going to probably be

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.870 
their touch is going to probably be
horrific<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.350> I'm<00:04:17.190> not<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.430> best<00:04:17.639> of<00:04:17.789> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
horrific and I'm not the best of the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.060 
horrific and I'm not the best of the
game<00:04:18.030> just<00:04:18.299> yet<00:04:18.450> anyway<00:04:18.780> although<00:04:19.139> probably

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
game just yet anyway although probably

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.730 
game just yet anyway although probably
better<00:04:20.549> than<00:04:20.669> i<00:04:20.729> was<00:04:20.909> at<00:04:21.030> fifa<00:04:21.239> 13<00:04:21.740> probably

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
better than i was at fifa 13 probably

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.810 
better than i was at fifa 13 probably
because<00:04:23.099> headers<00:04:23.490> are
