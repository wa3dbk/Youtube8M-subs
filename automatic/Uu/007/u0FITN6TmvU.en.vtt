00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.160 
so that just proves that otterbox is
just<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.240> little<00:03:02.540> bit<00:03:02.660> better<00:03:02.840> than<00:03:03.080> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
just a little bit better than the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.450 
just a little bit better than the
ballistic

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.890
