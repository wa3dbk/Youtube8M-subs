00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
quite sure what this is called but it's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.380 
quite sure what this is called but it's
believed<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.220> about<00:01:11.310> four<00:01:12.060> weeks<00:01:12.290> and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
believed me now for about four weeks and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
believed me now for about four weeks and
because<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.600> directly<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> top<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
because it's directly at the top in the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.740 
because it's directly at the top in the
seat<00:01:17.759> I've<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.150> quite<00:01:18.360> decent<00:01:18.869> flow<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.200> water

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
seat I've got quite decent flow of water

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
seat I've got quite decent flow of water
I'm<00:01:21.750> turning<00:01:22.140> over<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> head

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
I'm turning over probably at this head

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
I'm turning over probably at this head
of<00:01:23.340> water<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.880> probably<00:01:24.119> turn<00:01:24.360> over<00:01:24.689> about

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
of water I'm probably turn over about

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.429 
of water I'm probably turn over about
450<00:01:25.619> 500<00:01:26.340> litres<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> water<00:01:26.939> an<00:01:27.360> hour<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.380> I'm

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
450 500 litres of water an hour so I'm

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
450 500 litres of water an hour so I'm
probably<00:01:28.590> turning<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> tank<00:01:29.460> over<00:01:29.670> 1012

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
probably turning the tank over 1012

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.749 
probably turning the tank over 1012
times<00:01:30.720> an<00:01:30.990> hour<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.829> obviously<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.549> going

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
times an hour so obviously that is going

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.530 
times an hour so obviously that is going
directly<00:01:33.450> down<00:01:33.740> onto<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.159> Coral<00:01:35.909> down<00:01:36.180> here

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
directly down onto this Coral down here

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
directly down onto this Coral down here
which<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.990> obviously<00:01:37.860> creating<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> water

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
which is obviously creating the water

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.899 
which is obviously creating the water
movement<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.729> yeah<00:01:41.729> there's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
movement that you can see yeah there's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
movement that you can see yeah there's
quite<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.140> strong<00:01:43.140> current<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.829> my<00:01:44.009> tank<00:01:44.310> but

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
quite a strong current in my tank but

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.289 
quite a strong current in my tank but
obviously<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.240> fish<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.780> got<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
obviously all my fish have got use of it

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
obviously all my fish have got use of it
when<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> first<00:01:48.540> sort<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> turned<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
when I first sort of turned it on and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.660 
when I first sort of turned it on and
add<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.610> running<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.259> fish<00:01:52.259> we're

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
add it up and running the fish we're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.859 
add it up and running the fish we're
sort<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> being<00:01:53.909> blown<00:01:54.149> around<00:01:54.329> around<00:01:54.750> in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
sort of being blown around around in

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.039 
sort of being blown around around in
circles<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.570> called<00:01:57.810> fish

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
circles but they you know my called fish

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.719 
circles but they you know my called fish
they<00:01:58.290> adapt<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.680> also<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.700> my
