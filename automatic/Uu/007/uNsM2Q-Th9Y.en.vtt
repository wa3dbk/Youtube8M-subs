 we are dedicated to nail care 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.680
 right away with the base of everything that is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.580
 precisely the tutorial for a correct but 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.580
 professional niker 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.129
 to make this tutorial he used 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.559
 the perfect nail kit of 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.079
 collistar which includes a scrub 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.690
 smoothing a cuticle an elixir 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.019
 Triphasic nails is a hardening nails 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.019
 anti breakage 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.320
 this scrub smoothes the surface of the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.660
 nails and makes it smooth uniform gloss 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.700
 and minimizes imperfections ed 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.840
 nail estimator also helps 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.840
 in the two small revolution 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.080
 start spreading it on the cuticles in the 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.080
 area around the wife 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.750
 remember not to ever cut the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.579
 cuticles but massage them 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.759
 of the Indian ronnie stick as I am 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.759
 showing 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.400
 in fact, if you cut them with scissors 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.060
 do nothing but favor it 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.130
 regrowth 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.130
 so I would say that it is better to avoid 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.390
 use the widest part of the stick 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 place it on the nail and press 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.320
 slightly upwards 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.740
 sure with a little massage on 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 cuticles the nails so as to be absorbed 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.550
 well the product I applied e 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.420
 allow small balls to do the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.420
 their scrub work 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.450
 it's time to file here now 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.970
 we have to decide the shape we want 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.840
 give to the nails and if necessary also 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.840
 shortened a little bit 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.900
 to prevent nails from flaking off 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.420
 preferred a file of filed cardboard 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.620
 nails always in the same direction as from 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.620

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.150
 suitable for those who are one of the most 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.160
 the triphasic formula is fragile and stressed 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.980

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.340
 such as those of sweet almond flax 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.340
 jojoba and blackcurrant 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.730
 quoted I spread it on my nails and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.730
 massage until completely absorbed 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.590
