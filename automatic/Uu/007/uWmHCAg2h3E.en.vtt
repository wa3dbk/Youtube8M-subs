 I'm bringing you another video 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.880
 Air tutorial survival evolved and that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.460
 video I'll show you guys how 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.650
 what do we do to tame the margin 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.210
 stable margin for those who do not 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 know is the eagle is on the wiki of the air that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.130
 he is like some English vulture 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 something but the eagle we 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 Are you going to sleep in this beauty video? 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.920
 So here I have already separated the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 things to make his cell and what 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 happens guys to the busy cell but 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.510
 We do not need iron, so the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.530
 things we will need are these 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 here o 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 we need 350 rights 185 fibers 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.109
 and 150 of what was tim or 150 of shipping 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 works with the two is then I 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 I have separated here just to illustrate 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.360
 to you that can be both shishin 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 as much as what she had there is what 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.970
 You have easier to pick then. 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.850
 I'll pass everything on to my inventory here. 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 do with yourself and there already already 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.350
 It's enabled to make people tava. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.110
 they said then let's do here and there 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.299
 people go out to look for one because 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.220
 people either do not stay here for 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.430
 near where we are he will be 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 more to the side side of the mountains and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.759
 everything else 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.710
 firefighter then we already have our 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 cell that inventory I had 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 left the tranquilizer arrows here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.860
 separated the narcotic and two arches 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.850
 arrows and a father who here only for 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.229
 Beauty security then it was now I go 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.180
 do that cut I always do 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.610
 I'm going out to look for the stable agent. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 And the time that I find one here I come back 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.590
 so come on 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.069
 good people have one here then let's go 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.360
 trying to overthrow this here to see if the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.650
 people can 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.980
 I have the impression that I am 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:22.800
 wandering all the arrows fell here 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.280
 Who died good, we got here. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.500
 People, I thought I'd killed her more. 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.959
 here we managed to overthrow her 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
 then she died almost anyone that I 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.459
 I thought I was missing the arrows. 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.220
 But anyway, it's good here I'm going to start 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.810
 put the meat here I'll do with meat 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.810
 normal even for guys 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.989
 and I'll put the narcotics here as well and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.110
 We wait to see how much time there is. 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.269
 It will take beauty then as always. 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.680
 People, I'll make that quick cut. 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.930
 here in the video and the time that it's time 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.130
 he is waking us back 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.130
 so come on 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.019
 Good guys, I just finished here and what? 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.080
 happened the following let only give 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.310
 a name here for him I explained to 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.269
 you then here oppose the bacteria guide 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.430
 clothes only for a school here so what? 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.250
 happened here the guys were as follows 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.209
 This one is not the same as the one 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.519
 taming because that one came 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.319
 two other places and attacked me and killed 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.090
 I thought it was good. 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.530
 so I had to take down another one that is 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.530
 this here in case 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.840
 but whats the difference that there was level 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.130
 4 is this from here when I overthrew her 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.090
 I was level 12 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.549
 she gained one more level after the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.000
 people of the month was then a test 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.750
 as she was level 12 she was going to be fine 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.889
 more than the other then what I did 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.060
 that's how I slept with her 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.400
 normal 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.639
 at the end I put two prime 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.590
 time only then is the whole process 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:18.510
 was normal and the meat and Kuhn and Coty 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.650
 only at the very end even though I put 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.020
 two premises that was to finish a 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.800
 a little faster beauty but then I 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.710
 I put the time 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.990
 in the edition and then you can have a 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.180
 The idea is that if it were at level 4 and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.789
 faster if you get put 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.250
 the more primitive it will be even faster 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:48.569
 and so on beauty goes so let's put the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:50.520
 cell in it here and beauty I think 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.180
 that this one is one of the most 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.000
 of the game with certainty because we are going 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.280
 see straight ahead here 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.159
 Look here this is the time I think the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.409
 eagle really is one of the coolest 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:09.240
 and I think it's the animal that everyone 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:12.509
 really domestic, then the 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.960
 utility it is precisely this right 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:20.389
 So you can fly a lot through 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.610
 by map is well only change here is the vision 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.539
 can fly very smoothly across the map 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.389
 Can you attack right then and there? 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.719
 left button you attack with the 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.960
 You can get things right , right? 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:39.090
 oops a largadinha can catch people 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.719
 finally you can carry a friend of yours 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.680
 You're not even going to mess with the button. 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:49.409
 right handle it and will fly with him 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.479
 which is very interesting beauty then I 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.400
 I'm going back here, sorry , it 's giving 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.770
 largadinhas more guys here do not know 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.449
 because I think it's because of the fog 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.310
 good people basically that 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.669
 I wanted to show you in this video. 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.759
 as domestic or stirring only one 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:09.509
 tip is when his histamine 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.550
 You're bound to go down then just take 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.860
 careful that if you stay flying over 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.039
 of the water that when the mine is over 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.289
 will land to recover histamine and 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:22.050
 you will not be able to do anything beauty 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.150
 so that was what guys I wanted 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.699
 To show you, I hope the 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.550
 tutorials are being useful and this is 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.849
 There, by force, a hug and even the 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.849
 next
