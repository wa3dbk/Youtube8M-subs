at that so we have some people who know

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.719 
at that so we have some people who know
about<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.690> old<00:00:59.809> technology<00:01:00.470> Janome<00:01:01.280> was<00:01:01.549> the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
about the old technology Janome was the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.700 
about the old technology Janome was the
first<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.180> create<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.900> home<00:01:03.199> embroidery
