00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 It is a course of mac, but it was painfully open 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.730
 I think I've done for the last time applescript but where simple ne more 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 For that we must not fare from the I this time is a little Mac s 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.220
 I would like to touch 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.290
 I switched to McMain and it's been almost a year, but I'll introduce this to this dock 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.140
 It is with me the dog has been put to the right 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:31.180
 And I can't say that I'll put it further on somewhere else. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.700
 I have to write the code, so I will teach you how to do it. 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.020
 I like this book I 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.010
 It's hard to use because it 's coming from the windows task bar 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.350
 In what launcher and taskbar 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.030
 a I don't need money, but I feel that I am not in line with the times, but I made this in my mind 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.710
 Was do is Steve Jobs 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:57.350
 Steve Jobs invented the " Dock" developed 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.219
 Jobs also have a patent where Jobs originally sketched out projections to the right 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.030
 And it's I 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.670
 I was standard about 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:12.220
 I I Why screen in this respect I'm not be there only left and right left was people and say or not say right 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.730
 Although the age of p type 8 in the old days was 640 times 400 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.770
 Now the wide screen 4 instead of 3 wide screen 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.430
 Once upon a time is now I'd also was good at was because this Lantis like is they've made this 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.400
 In 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:32.210
 I'm absolutely wide side by side I'm sure it's wide no matter what work you do 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.280
 I think it makes sense to put it from side to side 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:42.080
 It is natural that it flows naturally from the top to the bottom when it is done with the tone program 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.100
 It is less stress if you enter a lot of 21 seconds 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.509
 It's generally is which way whether a person is doing Well developed in such of 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.230
 Those who are doing windows do tasks on windows 7 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.930
 There is no such thing as putting 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.470
 This time I will teach you how to put on the upper right Open the terminal Dos like prompt 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.130
 It is mon 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:09.990
 Now I play a little have entered and hit it to return to the original if the task Yes Ikke screen 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.220
 When you enter the string you hit, the task bar will come back to the center as usual. 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.600
 The display is still changing, but here 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.830
 I will do it because I have to refresh the screen 2 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.830
 I 'm going 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:29.200
 I 'm in the middle This is one of the normal edition docks, but I'm doing it right now 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:35.270
 Is yes let's closer to the top right corner when this 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.069
 I 'm going to go to the top, and I will go to Nishi Kido 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.069
 Yes 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:46.510
 I came to the top as above , so of course the lower right lower left upper left 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.629
 Where I put the even but I am put in the upper right corner 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.549
 Only the way in the upper right will be explained this time 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.299
 Yes I can see a bit if I can't see it I will upload it to my blog 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.090
 please look 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.290
 Yellow 9 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:06.800
 This is the setting for the dog in the upper right 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.640
 Comment to start Rokkosai after saying this in the coordinate setting of putting the dog in the upper right 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.190
 Is this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:16.080
 If Wow case that I wish after all local is good not like the way the upper-right corner this is the fault 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.700
 Well this sets the default coordinates 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.110
 If you put this in and give it a refreshment of the lock, this will be another 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:28.630
 As I mentioned earlier 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:33.970
 The Tteyuu depression at the command line I I I just hit it a command line here 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:38.950
 In short, when you are working with os directly , ask at your own risk 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:43.630
 As for the dog dock, I already eliminated one simple one, right? 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.180
 Thats Ne need it even got off a total of Oh momentum of about only finder 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:51.820
 I thought I didn't need a launcher 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.990
 What also plays the role of the task bar is really contrary to this I enter from the preferences here 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:04:00.470
 Far 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:01.310
 There is no setting, so there is only right or bottom or left and this is the setting 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.819
 I have no 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.939
 Mac os course-to-two series in the not say contains 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.939
 By Wow that was to do with respect to the shifting of the dog
