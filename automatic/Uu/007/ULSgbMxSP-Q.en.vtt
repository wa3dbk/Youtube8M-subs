on<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.340> most<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> other<00:01:53.970> ones<00:01:54.240> okay

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
on just like most the other ones okay

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
on just like most the other ones okay
but<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but what I really like about this is as

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.959 
but what I really like about this is as
you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.869> guys<00:01:58.079> there's<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.469> little

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
you can see guys there's this little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.039 
you can see guys there's this little
indentation<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.299> almost<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> little

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
indentation it's almost like a little

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.039 
indentation it's almost like a little
gully<00:02:01.500> okay<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.909> makes<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.869> really

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
gully okay so it makes it really really

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.770 
gully okay so it makes it really really
solid<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.070> bottom<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.670> phone<00:02:05.969> okay<00:02:06.570> it's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
solid on the bottom your phone okay it's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.710 
solid on the bottom your phone okay it's
almost<00:02:07.229> looks<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.250> belongs<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:09.149> okay

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
almost looks like it belongs there okay

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.089 
almost looks like it belongs there okay
so<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> little<00:02:10.920> blue

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so you can see that the little blue

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.740 
so you can see that the little blue
light<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.790> tells<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
light is on which tells you that the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.610 
light is on which tells you that the
phone<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.350> charging<00:02:13.790> thing<00:02:15.260> okay<00:02:16.260> which<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
phone is charging thing okay which is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.820 
phone is charging thing okay which is
really<00:02:16.860> cool<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:22.020> really<00:02:22.410> really

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
really cool and it's a really really

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.910 
really cool and it's a really really
nice<00:02:23.130> design<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.940> mean<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.650> I've

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
nice design I mean you know I've

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
nice design I mean you know I've
reviewed<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.970> bunch<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.390> these<00:02:27.480> external

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
reviewed a bunch of these external

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.470 
reviewed a bunch of these external
battery<00:02:28.470> packs<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.100> i'm<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.970> not<00:02:30.090> big<00:02:30.360> on

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
battery packs and i'm really not big on

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.910 
battery packs and i'm really not big on
the<00:02:30.630> ones<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.020> kind<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.380> hang<00:02:31.590> off<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the ones that kind of hang off the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.430 
the ones that kind of hang off the
bottom<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> really<00:02:33.870> nice<00:02:34.020> design

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
bottom but this is a really nice design

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.920 
bottom but this is a really nice design
i<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:35.730> how<00:02:35.940> there's<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.420> kind<00:02:36.810> of

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
i like how there's this kind of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.600 
i like how there's this kind of
indentation<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.100> goes<00:02:38.280> around<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
indentation so it goes around the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.699 
indentation so it goes around the
contour<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.180> phone<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> little<00:02:39.690> bit<00:02:39.959> kind<00:02:40.560> of

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
contour the phone a little bit kind of

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.449 
contour the phone a little bit kind of
goes<00:02:41.130> up<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.090> tad<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.140> it's<00:02:43.740> it's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
goes up the back just a tad so it's it's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.310 
goes up the back just a tad so it's it's
pretty<00:02:44.760> solid<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.420> nice<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.810> solid<00:02:45.989> on

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
pretty solid it's nice and solid on

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.440 
pretty solid it's nice and solid on
there<00:02:46.560> I'm<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.190> worried<00:02:47.550> about<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.330> know

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
there I'm not worried about you know

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.630 
there I'm not worried about you know
what<00:02:48.570> kind<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.840> breaking<00:02:49.290> off<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.830> it'll<00:02:50.489> break

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
what kind of breaking off or it'll break

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.040 
what kind of breaking off or it'll break
it<00:02:50.790> off<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.030> my<00:02:51.060> phone<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.690> probably

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.150 
it off on my phone now you probably
wouldn't<00:02:52.380> throw<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.890> your<00:02:52.980> pocket<00:02:54.080> but
