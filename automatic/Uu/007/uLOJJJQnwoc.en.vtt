00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 do not 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.520
 in 2003 at the base of Mount Olympus it 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.140
 discovered a similar temple 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.830
 it was the central element of a city 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.800
 old call plane and it was dedicated 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.269
 to zeus 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.160
 it's a city that was built in the 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.810
 base of the mount all in so that is 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.119
 very close to the home of the gods and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.579
 Olympian goddesses and where zeus lived 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.349
 in Greek mythology in fact the 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.770
 name of the city john means to 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.770
 Zeus 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.370
 the temple of dion dates from the fifth century 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.430
 before the golden age of mythology 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.430
 Greek 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 scattered around the area there are blocks of 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.379
 marble with an unmistakable relief 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.050
 Eagles 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.309
 in ancient Greece the eagles were the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.309
 divine symbol of zeus 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 but there is more 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.900
 this decapitated statue was found 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 in a nearby river recorded at its base that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.670
 is 2,400 years old there are three 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.670
 words zeus the supreme 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.170
 the experts debate that it could 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.240
 mean this reference to the supreme 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.650
 some believe that this statue could 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.150
 be a missing link between the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.670
 adoration that the ancient Greeks 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.560
 professed by numerous gods and the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.350
 monotheistic philosophy of Christians and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.180
 Jews and they also believe that this finding 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.740
 is proof that the Greeks already 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.789
 they handled the concept of a single god 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.890
 before the appearance of Christianity 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.189
 the Greeks sometimes identified the self 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.649
 supreme with zeus after all of the 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.590
 word zeus in its original form ceos 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.270
 the Latin word deus is derived 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.410
 there are etymological reasons for 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.820
 consider him the supreme deity 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.540
 from the third century the first before 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.250
 of Christ 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.980
 we see that different schools arise 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.110
 philosophical and theological that begin 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.660
 propose a new vision that only 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.730
 there is a god and that all the stories 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.200
 ancient all the ancient narrations 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.970
 they are just metaphors that reflect 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.040
 different aspects of this divinity 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.900
 for the people who worshiped the god 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.020
 of God it is clear that zeus was very 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.970
 different from the other gods and greeks 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.750
 in fact it could very well be the only 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.750
 what mattered
