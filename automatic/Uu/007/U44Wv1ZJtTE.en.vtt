hello Brian Lynch here it's February 19

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.960 
hello Brian Lynch here it's February 19
2012<00:00:03.720> I'm<00:00:04.049> out<00:00:04.290> at<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.500> house<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.980> we've<00:00:05.850> had

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
2012 I'm out at the house and we've had

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.320 
2012 I'm out at the house and we've had
a<00:00:06.000> couple<00:00:06.290> warm<00:00:07.290> days<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:08.069> think<00:00:08.519> got<00:00:08.940> up<00:00:09.059> into

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
a couple warm days I think got up into

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.860 
a couple warm days I think got up into
the<00:00:09.420> sixties<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.870> couple<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.429> days<00:00:11.429> ago<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.000> as

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the sixties a couple of days ago and as

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.320 
the sixties a couple of days ago and as
you<00:00:13.410> can<00:00:13.530> see<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:13.980> nectarine<00:00:14.759> tree<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
you can see on this nectarine tree the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.349 
you can see on this nectarine tree the
the<00:00:15.719> buds<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.850> really<00:00:17.850> started<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.210> get

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the buds have really started to get

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.150 
the buds have really started to get
pretty<00:00:18.690> big<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> good<00:00:19.680> time<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.890> start

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
pretty big so it's a good time to start

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670 
pretty big so it's a good time to start
thinking<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.900> fungicides<00:00:21.900> most

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
thinking about fungicides most

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220 
thinking about fungicides most
fungicides<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.369> preventative<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> they<00:00:25.050> have

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
fungicides are preventative so they have

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.880 
fungicides are preventative so they have
to<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:26.130> applied<00:00:26.400> before<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.320> fungus<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
to be applied before the fungus has a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.009 
to be applied before the fungus has a
chance<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.429> take<00:00:29.910> hold<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.330> order<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> be

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
chance to get take hold in order to be

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.110 
chance to get take hold in order to be
effective

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
effective

effective
one<00:00:33.120> fungicide<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
one fungicide that I really like is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.760 
one fungicide that I really like is
called<00:00:35.190> Bordeaux<00:00:35.640> mixture<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:37.200> made<00:00:37.440> from

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
called Bordeaux mixture it's made from

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.360 
called Bordeaux mixture it's made from
two<00:00:38.399> different<00:00:40.850> chemicals<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
two different chemicals the first is

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
two different chemicals the first is
hydrated<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.940> Gotham<00:00:45.570> find<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.960> these

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
hydrated one I Gotham find it in these

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.670 
hydrated one I Gotham find it in these
big<00:00:46.289> containers<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.149> something<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.680> copper

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
big containers and something is copper

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.400 
big containers and something is copper
sulfate<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.780> nice<00:00:52.050> blue

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
sulfate which has a really nice blue

sulfate which has a really nice blue
color<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.469> solution

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
color to it the way I make my solution

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.380 
color to it the way I make my solution
is<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.690> pound<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.760> hydrated<00:00:59.760> lime<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
is I take one pound of hydrated lime and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
is I take one pound of hydrated lime and
I<00:01:01.199> put<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> into<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:02.489> gallon<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.059> water<00:01:04.070> later

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
I put it into one gallon of water later

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.590 
I put it into one gallon of water later
and<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:06.000> pound<00:01:06.270> copper<00:01:06.720> sulfate<00:01:07.170> into<00:01:07.490> a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
and a pound copper sulfate into a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.820 
and a pound copper sulfate into a
another<00:01:09.600> gallon<00:01:09.990> container<00:01:10.290> fill<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.710> both

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
another gallon container fill them both

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.480 
another gallon container fill them both
up<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.220> water<00:01:12.500> as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
up with water as you can see here the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
up with water as you can see here the
hydrated<00:01:17.490> lime<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:18.119> eventually<00:01:18.780> settle<00:01:19.710> out

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
hydrated lime will eventually settle out

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
hydrated lime will eventually settle out
and<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> separation

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and see a little bit of a separation

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
and see a little bit of a separation
there<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> bottom<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
there so it's all at the bottom so you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.070 
there so it's all at the bottom so you
do<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.900> give<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.259> shake<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:27.080> get

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
do have to give it a good shake to get

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.940 
do have to give it a good shake to get
it<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> solution

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
it back in the solution

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.040 
it back in the solution
now<00:01:31.950> once<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.760> have<00:01:32.880> these<00:01:33.090> two<00:01:33.360> things

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.340 

just<00:01:37.050> get<00:01:37.230> a<00:01:37.470> sprayer<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.090> one

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
just get a sprayer and I like this one

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.860 
just get a sprayer and I like this one
and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:41.340> use<00:01:41.940> two<00:01:42.660> cups<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.520> hydrated<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:45.480> two

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
and I use two cups of hydrated or two

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.230 
and I use two cups of hydrated or two
cups<00:01:46.050> of<00:01:46.170> copper<00:01:46.470> sulphate<00:01:46.800> say<00:01:47.340> copper

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
cups of copper sulphate say copper

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
cups of copper sulphate say copper
sulphate<00:01:48.630> solution<00:01:52.700> pour<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:58.470> use<00:01:58.650> two

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
sulphate solution pour it in and use two

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.030 
sulphate solution pour it in and use two
cups<00:01:59.160> of<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:01.010> hydrated<00:02:02.010> lime<00:02:02.130> solution<00:02:04.040> pour

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
cups of the hydrated lime solution pour

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:15.680 
cups of the hydrated lime solution pour
it<00:02:05.160> in<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.210> gallon<00:02:11.600> sprayer<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
it in this is a gallon sprayer and I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.120 
it in this is a gallon sprayer and I
will<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.200> fill<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:19.530> gallon

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
will have to fill it up with one gallon

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.840 
will have to fill it up with one gallon
of<00:02:20.250> water

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
of water

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.410 
of water
this<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.480> cause<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.960> be<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> once<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.520> 10<00:02:24.120> 10

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
this will cause it to be a once a 10 10

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.630 
this will cause it to be a once a 10 10
100<00:02:24.960> solution<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.480> Bordeaux<00:02:27.480> mixture<00:02:28.640> it's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
100 solution of Bordeaux mixture it's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
100 solution of Bordeaux mixture it's
pretty<00:02:29.880> good<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.210> dormant<00:02:30.600> spray<00:02:30.870> at<00:02:30.990> least

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
pretty good for a dormant spray at least

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.790 
pretty good for a dormant spray at least
what<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.770> found<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.200> said<00:02:34.260> before<00:02:34.530> it's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
what I found and like I said before it's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.790 
what I found and like I said before it's
considered<00:02:35.160> organic<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:36.239> problem<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.080> goes

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
considered organic one problem I goes

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
considered organic one problem I goes
with<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.730> does<00:02:38.880> leave<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
with it is that it does leave a bit of a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.550 
with it is that it does leave a bit of a
residue<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.130> sprayer<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.880> be<00:02:42.090> sure<00:02:42.120> to
