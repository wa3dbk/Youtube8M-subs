flame<00:01:07.390> novel<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.420> guess<00:01:08.570> you'd<00:01:08.720> call<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:10.479> so

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479

that's<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:13.760> complement<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.720> i<00:01:14.840> guess

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
that's that and to complement it i guess

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.580 
that's that and to complement it i guess
to<00:01:15.409> use<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.770> cook<00:01:15.979> i<00:01:16.159> got<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.840> gsi<00:01:17.840> outdoors

leave<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.450> for<00:02:20.510> emergency<00:02:21.170> because

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
leave it in there for emergency because

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.750 
leave it in there for emergency because
it<00:02:21.560> kind<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.739> folds<00:02:21.950> up<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.280> doesn't<00:02:22.370> take<00:02:22.610> any

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it kind of folds up it doesn't take any

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.789 
it kind of folds up it doesn't take any
space<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.930> swapped<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.379> out<00:02:24.439> for<00:02:24.500> this

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
space but I swapped it out for this

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.350 
space but I swapped it out for this
light<00:02:25.280> my<00:02:25.459> fire<00:02:25.700> spark<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.849> can<00:02:29.000> get<00:02:29.180> in

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
light my fire spark so you can get in

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.759 
light my fire spark so you can get in
there<00:02:30.099> yeah<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.170> kids<00:02:33.530> one

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.440 
there yeah so this is like the kids one
I<00:02:33.799> think<00:02:34.159> actually<00:02:34.370> but<00:02:34.819> since<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.329> nice

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
I think actually but since it is nice

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.080 
I think actually but since it is nice
and<00:02:35.480> small<00:02:36.189> fit<00:02:37.189> right<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.549> there<00:02:37.670> kind<00:02:37.909> of<00:02:37.970> got

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and small fit right in there kind of got

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.869 
and small fit right in there kind of got
to<00:02:38.180> bend<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.480> down<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.109> it<00:02:39.590> fits<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.700> use

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
to bend it down but it fits so I use

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.750 
to bend it down but it fits so I use
that<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.260> tonight<00:02:46.129> I'm<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.459> be<00:02:46.579> eating

you<00:02:54.769> know<00:02:54.859> space<00:02:55.159> wise<00:02:55.400> because<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:55.849> is<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you know space wise because this is the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.490 
you know space wise because this is the
normal<00:02:56.409> bag<00:02:57.409> and<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.299> lots<00:02:59.510> you<00:03:00.230> know<00:03:00.349> it's

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
normal bag and it's a lots you know it's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.360 
normal bag and it's a lots you know it's
a<00:03:00.530> lot<00:03:00.650> smaller<00:03:00.799> space<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.459> compact<00:03:01.879> so<00:03:03.370> so

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
a lot smaller space and compact so so

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.309 
a lot smaller space and compact so so
let<00:03:04.639> me<00:03:04.730> pour<00:03:05.540> all<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.750> water<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.049> stuff<00:03:06.500> and

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
let me pour all the water and stuff and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.050 
let me pour all the water and stuff and
then<00:03:09.319> what<00:03:09.470> gets<00:03:09.650> cooking<00:03:09.889> and<00:03:10.159> I'll<00:03:10.519> actually

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
then what gets cooking and I'll actually

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.640 
then what gets cooking and I'll actually
show<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.540> how<00:03:11.750> long<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:11.959> takes<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.290> boil<00:03:12.500> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
show you how long it takes to boil the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.009 
show you how long it takes to boil the
water<00:03:12.799> so<00:03:13.159> this<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.150> hold<00:03:14.299> about<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.599> think

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
water so this can hold about I think

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.740 
water so this can hold about I think
it's<00:03:15.139> at<00:03:15.260> point<00:03:15.560> six<00:03:15.859> liters<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.609> just<00:03:17.510> enough

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
it's at point six liters so just enough

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.629 
it's at point six liters so just enough
to<00:03:17.900> make<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.379> know<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> nice<00:03:18.799> little<00:03:18.829> single

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
to make you know a nice little single

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:32.240 
to make you know a nice little single
meal<00:03:20.180> like<00:03:20.389> this<00:03:21.099> all<00:03:22.099> right<00:03:22.489> let's<00:03:22.669> do

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:04:41.100 

you

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.560 

seal<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.320> wait<00:04:42.669> ceelo's<00:04:46.120> eight<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.389> nine

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
seal it and wait ceelo's eight to nine

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.800 
seal it and wait ceelo's eight to nine
minutes<00:04:48.020> so<00:04:48.320> we'll<00:04:48.740> be<00:04:48.889> right<00:04:49.130> back<00:04:49.660> I'd<00:04:50.660> be
