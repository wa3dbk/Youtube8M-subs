firmware the tills working a lot better

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.270 
firmware the tills working a lot better
than<00:00:34.690> they<00:00:34.780> used<00:00:34.809> to<00:00:36.539> but<00:00:37.539> then<00:00:37.810> you<00:00:38.280> went

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
than they used to but then you went

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.360 
than they used to but then you went
flybarless<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.890> put<00:00:42.160> 750<00:00:42.880> on<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.860> fury<00:00:45.250> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
flybarless and we put 750 on your fury I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.299 
flybarless and we put 750 on your fury I
had<00:00:48.370> got<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.120> little<00:00:49.390> gyro<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.870> B<00:00:50.260> come<00:00:50.980> on<00:00:51.130> to

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
had got a little gyro and B come on to

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.750 
had got a little gyro and B come on to
try<00:00:51.489> something<00:00:51.880> new<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:56.470> Friday<00:00:57.040> you<00:00:57.219> decided

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
try something new so Friday you decided

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.569

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
to put this micro beast on and I think

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.170 
to put this micro beast on and I think
we<00:01:00.820> come<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.510> conclusion<00:01:01.800> yes<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:04.030> you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
we come to that conclusion yes that you

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.850 
we come to that conclusion yes that you
should<00:01:04.390> do<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:04.809> case<00:01:05.199> somebody<00:01:05.560> called

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
should do that in case somebody called

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.899 
should do that in case somebody called
you'd<00:01:06.100> be<00:01:06.250> able<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.460> help<00:01:06.640> them<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.979> put

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
you'd be able to help them and you put

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.919 
you'd be able to help them and you put
it<00:01:09.999> on<00:01:10.179> and<00:01:10.630> if<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:10.959> recall<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:13.240> went<00:01:13.479> out<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
we found out that a lot of guys aren't

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.650 
we found out that a lot of guys aren't
using<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.140> tape<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:01.220> comes<00:02:01.760> with<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.330> micro

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
using the tape that comes with the micro

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.520 
using the tape that comes with the micro
Beast<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.260> doesn't<00:02:04.160> seem<00:02:04.310> right<00:02:05.259> it<00:02:06.259> doesn't

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
Beast that doesn't seem right it doesn't

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.249 
Beast that doesn't seem right it doesn't
seem<00:02:06.860> right<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.399> in<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.270> instruction<00:02:08.869> manual

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
seem right and in the instruction manual

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.940 
seem right and in the instruction manual
it<00:02:09.380> says<00:02:09.619> if<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.070> this<00:02:10.280> problem

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
it says if you have this problem

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.570 
it says if you have this problem
relocated<00:02:12.950> or<00:02:13.100> change<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.640> tape<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.570> I<00:02:15.580> didn't

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
relocated or change the tape so I didn't

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.180 
relocated or change the tape so I didn't
think<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.790> would<00:02:16.940> make<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.270> much<00:02:17.450> difference

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
think it would make that much difference

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.550 
think it would make that much difference
but<00:02:19.190> after<00:02:19.550> about<00:02:19.760> 8<00:02:20.209> hours<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.900> working<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
but after about 8 hours of working on it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.220 
but after about 8 hours of working on it
I<00:02:22.030> decided<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.360> go<00:02:23.510> ahead<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.780> change<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
I decided to go ahead and change the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.360 
I decided to go ahead and change the
tape<00:02:24.470> yeah<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:26.150> flew<00:02:26.360> perfect<00:02:27.130> no<00:02:28.130> more

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370
