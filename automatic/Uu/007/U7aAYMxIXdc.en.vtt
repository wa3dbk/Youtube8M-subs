the<00:00:17.490> link<00:00:17.700> will<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:17.939> in<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.750> description<00:00:19.290> here

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
the link will be in the description here

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.920 
the link will be in the description here
firstly<00:00:21.510> there's<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> control<00:00:22.230> box<00:00:22.529> cover

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
firstly there's a control box cover

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.230 
firstly there's a control box cover
which<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:24.960> weatherproof

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
which is weatherproof

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.630 
which is weatherproof
so<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> rains<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> brain

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
so if it rains when I'm out the brain

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.970 
so if it rains when I'm out the brain
inside<00:00:29.850> here<00:00:30.420> doesn't<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.140> wet<00:00:31.380> which<00:00:31.830> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
inside here doesn't get wet which is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.820 
inside here doesn't get wet which is
very<00:00:32.220> very<00:00:32.489> important<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:34.170> second<00:00:34.559> part<00:00:34.739> of

now one of the things that's been
leveled<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.329> mine<00:00:57.539> lab<00:00:57.750> machines<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
leveled at mine lab machines is that the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
leveled at mine lab machines is that the
new<00:00:58.829> ones<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.370> bit<00:00:59.520> heavy<00:00:59.730> compared

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to a lot of people's machines so why

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.020 
to a lot of people's machines so why
would<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> add<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.530> weird<00:01:05.030> well

don't<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> take<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.950> cover<00:02:08.190> off<00:02:08.310> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
don't have to take this cover off I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.780 
don't have to take this cover off I
actually<00:02:09.479> had<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.929> previous<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
actually had one previous to this and I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.979 
actually had one previous to this and I
couldn't<00:02:12.180> use<00:02:12.329> it<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.540> bright<00:02:12.750> weather

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
couldn't use it in bright weather

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.360 
couldn't use it in bright weather
because<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.620> couldn't<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.099> what<00:02:14.340> was

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
because I just couldn't see what was

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.890 
because I just couldn't see what was
happening<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> screen

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900

turn<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.049> on<00:02:18.170> let<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.830> look<00:02:19.629> just<00:02:20.629> zoom

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
turn it on let you have a look just zoom

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.920 
turn it on let you have a look just zoom

in on that there you go you can see the

reason their depth gauge discrimination

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.979 
reason their depth gauge discrimination
pattern<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:34.220> pretty<00:02:34.459> clear<00:02:34.989> definitely

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
pattern it's pretty clear definitely

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.589 
pattern it's pretty clear definitely
better<00:02:36.140> than<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.379> last<00:02:36.530> one<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.769> had<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.450> this

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
better than the last one I had so this

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.569 
better than the last one I had so this
overall<00:02:39.400> excellent

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
overall excellent

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.750 
overall excellent
now<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.599> mentioned<00:02:41.959> before<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:43.400> handle

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
now I mentioned before that this handle

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.440 
now I mentioned before that this handle
cover<00:02:44.030> has<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.640> little<00:02:46.879> compartment<00:02:47.180> here

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450

for your spare battery batteries by the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.059 
for your spare battery batteries by the
very<00:02:51.170> design<00:02:51.530> we're<00:02:51.980> quite<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> bit<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:54.069> by

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
very design we're quite a bit so by

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.140 
very design we're quite a bit so by
adding<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:57.620> top<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.489> already

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
adding this on top of the the already

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.420 
adding this on top of the the already
considerable<00:02:59.750> weight<00:02:59.959> especially<00:03:00.290> if<00:03:01.220> you're

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
considerable weight especially if you're

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.069 
considerable weight especially if you're
using<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.730> big<00:03:01.760> coil<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.329> a<00:03:02.480> 10<00:03:02.750> do<00:03:02.900> on

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
using a big coil like a 10 do on

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.069 
using a big coil like a 10 do on
postulant<00:03:04.299> now<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.359> think<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.659> would<00:03:05.900> make

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
postulant now you think that would make

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.750 
postulant now you think that would make
it<00:03:06.230> even<00:03:06.379> heavier<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:06.980> swing<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.430> you'll<00:03:07.519> end

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
it even heavier to swing and you'll end

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.460 
it even heavier to swing and you'll end
up<00:03:07.879> being<00:03:08.030> absolutely<00:03:08.540> knackered<00:03:08.930> by<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.260> end

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
up being absolutely knackered by the end

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.430 
up being absolutely knackered by the end
of<00:03:09.530> your<00:03:09.620> hunt<00:03:10.659> but<00:03:11.659> it<00:03:11.750> actually<00:03:12.019> makes<00:03:12.290> it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
of your hunt but it actually makes it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.729 
of your hunt but it actually makes it
lighter<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.459> use<00:03:13.959> which<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.109> strange<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.560> mean<00:03:15.680> I

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
lighter to use which is strange I mean I

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.229 
lighter to use which is strange I mean I
can't<00:03:15.980> tell<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.220> exactly<00:03:16.310> why<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:17.060> I'm

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
can't tell you exactly why that is I'm

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.030 
can't tell you exactly why that is I'm
not<00:03:17.359> a<00:03:17.420> scientist<00:03:17.870> or<00:03:18.109> an<00:03:18.200> engineer<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.829> I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
not a scientist or an engineer but I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.099 
not a scientist or an engineer but I
think<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:19.970> has<00:03:20.120> something<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:20.780> the

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
think it has something to do with the

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.490 
think it has something to do with the
bounce<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.799> weird<00:03:22.989> when<00:03:23.989> you're<00:03:24.079> using<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.379> big

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
bounce of weird when you're using a big

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.289 
bounce of weird when you're using a big
coil<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.540> very<00:03:26.780> bottom<00:03:27.650> heavy<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:29.180> you're

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
coil it's very bottom heavy so you're

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.849 
coil it's very bottom heavy so you're
constantly<00:03:29.510> having<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.959> fight<00:03:30.500> against

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
constantly having to fight against

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.970 
constantly having to fight against
gravity<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.669> lift<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:31.970> up<00:03:32.319> and<00:03:33.319> what<00:03:33.530> happened

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
gravity to lift it up and what happened

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.039 
gravity to lift it up and what happened
a<00:03:34.160> little<00:03:34.669> bit<00:03:34.879> more<00:03:35.060> weird<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> upper

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
a little bit more weird to the upper

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.210 
a little bit more weird to the upper
part<00:03:36.319> of<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.949> stem<00:03:37.280> does<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:39.440> distributes<00:03:40.069> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
part of the stem does it distributes the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.670 
part of the stem does it distributes the
weight<00:03:40.250> better<00:03:41.319> because<00:03:42.319> you're<00:03:42.440> actually

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
weight better because you're actually

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.830 
weight better because you're actually
hold<00:03:42.859> not<00:03:43.069> at<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.220> machine<00:03:43.489> here<00:03:43.879> this<00:03:44.720> is

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
hold not at the machine here this is

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.460 
hold not at the machine here this is

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
your access point before all the way it

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.400 
your access point before all the way it
was<00:03:48.590> at<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.739> bottom<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.329> now<00:03:50.329> by<00:03:50.870> adding<00:03:51.169> more

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
was at the bottom and now by adding more

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.400 
was at the bottom and now by adding more
weight<00:03:51.650> here

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
weight here

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.170 
weight here
it<00:03:54.410> makes<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.280> Machine<00:03:55.579> better<00:03:56.389> balanced<00:03:58.180> it

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
it makes the Machine better balanced it

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.759 
it makes the Machine better balanced it
does<00:03:59.389> actually<00:03:59.569> make<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.989> better<00:04:00.139> to<00:04:00.290> use<00:04:00.470> well

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
does actually make it better to use well

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.800 
does actually make it better to use well
it<00:04:01.609> seems<00:04:01.849> strange<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.419> totally

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
it seems strange and totally

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.300 
it seems strange and totally
counterintuitive<00:04:03.139> but<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.709> actually<00:04:04.099> does

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
counterintuitive but it actually does

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.569 
counterintuitive but it actually does
makes<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.150> nicer<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.599> use<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.159> think<00:04:07.159> promise

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579

they've<00:04:42.389> bought<00:04:42.599> a<00:04:42.960> very<00:04:43.319> tight<00:04:43.949> fit

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
they've bought a very tight fit

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.260 
they've bought a very tight fit
which<00:04:46.080> makes<00:04:46.289> fitting<00:04:46.620> them<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:47.180> little<00:04:48.180> bit

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
which makes fitting them a little bit

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.450 
which makes fitting them a little bit
tricky<00:04:48.599> especially<00:04:49.439> this<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.800> didn't<00:04:50.430> realize

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
tricky especially this I didn't realize

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.860 
tricky especially this I didn't realize
how<00:04:50.879> to<00:04:50.939> actually<00:04:51.180> take<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.509> part<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.810> the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
how to actually take this part of the

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.869 
how to actually take this part of the
handle<00:04:52.139> off<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.800> get<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:53.039> on<00:04:53.189> but<00:04:53.340> once<00:04:53.550> it's<00:04:53.729> on

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
handle off to get it on but once it's on

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.689 
handle off to get it on but once it's on
it's<00:04:54.449> an<00:04:54.569> absolutely<00:04:55.050> perfect<00:04:55.319> fit<00:04:55.889> then

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
it's an absolutely perfect fit then

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.170 
it's an absolutely perfect fit then
because<00:04:57.180> it's<00:04:57.360> tight

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
because it's tight

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.760 
because it's tight
anything<00:05:00.180> that's<00:05:00.300> underneath<00:05:00.780> here<00:05:01.020> isn't

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
anything that's underneath here isn't

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.659 
anything that's underneath here isn't
gonna<00:05:02.009> wear

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
gonna wear

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.959 
gonna wear
if<00:05:03.509> this<00:05:03.690> wasn't<00:05:04.050> as<00:05:04.139> tight<00:05:04.849> it<00:05:05.849> would

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
if this wasn't as tight it would

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.300 
if this wasn't as tight it would
constantly<00:05:06.389> be<00:05:06.479> wearing<00:05:06.960> against<00:05:07.409> the<00:05:07.979> metal

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
constantly be wearing against the metal

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.180 
constantly be wearing against the metal
that's<00:05:08.430> under<00:05:08.699> here<00:05:08.969> the<00:05:09.599> form<00:05:09.900> handle<00:05:10.440> and

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
that's under here the form handle and

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.830 
that's under here the form handle and
you<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.370> end<00:05:11.490> up<00:05:11.639> probably<00:05:12.389> doing<00:05:12.719> your

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
you the end up probably doing your

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.529 
you the end up probably doing your
machine<00:05:13.139> more<00:05:13.440> harm<00:05:13.710> than<00:05:13.889> good

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
machine more harm than good

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.740 
machine more harm than good
so<00:05:15.539> overall<00:05:15.900> considering<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.069> price<00:05:17.629> this<00:05:18.629> is

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
so overall considering the price this is

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.320 
so overall considering the price this is
about<00:05:18.990> 16<00:05:19.529> quid<00:05:19.849> then<00:05:20.849> we<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.060> twenty

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
about 16 quid then we have twenty

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.600 
about 16 quid then we have twenty
eighteen<00:05:21.539> nineteen<00:05:21.990> quid<00:05:22.229> it's<00:05:23.039> not<00:05:23.279> much<00:05:23.460> to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
eighteen nineteen quid it's not much to

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.640 
eighteen nineteen quid it's not much to
pay<00:05:23.789> when<00:05:23.969> you've<00:05:24.090> spent<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.659> best<00:05:25.379> part<00:05:25.469> of
