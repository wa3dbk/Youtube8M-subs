their tears are not players when you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.690 
their tears are not players when you
first<00:00:31.679> spawn<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> kind<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.220> get<00:00:32.310> that<00:00:32.400> uneasy

like<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:34.950> does<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> AI<00:00:35.310> have<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.060> store<00:00:36.300> for

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
like what does the AI have in store for

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
like what does the AI have in store for
me<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.980> new

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
me in there because we have this new

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
me in there because we have this new
feature<00:00:38.340> called<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> AI<00:00:38.880> strategy<00:00:39.480> manager

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
feature called the AI strategy manager

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.960 
feature called the AI strategy manager
that<00:00:40.320> knows<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.250> you've<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.580> of<00:00:41.610> taken<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
that knows when you've kind of taken the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.280 
that knows when you've kind of taken the
objective<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:42.510> tries<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.750> route<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
objective and then tries to route the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
objective and then tries to route the
AIS<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> bed<00:00:44.490> most<00:00:44.730> optimal<00:00:45.240> path<00:00:45.420> but

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
AIS around the bed most optimal path but

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.260 
AIS around the bed most optimal path but
they<00:00:45.840> kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.080> ruin<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.830> day<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.880> that<00:00:48.090> when

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
they kind of ruin your day so that when

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.490 
they kind of ruin your day so that when
they<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.480> work<00:00:48.660> together<00:00:48.810> in<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> certain<00:00:49.380> way

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
they all work together in a certain way

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.890 
they all work together in a certain way
and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> strategy<00:00:50.280> manager<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.790> of<00:00:50.940> does

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
and the strategy manager kind of does

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.510 
and the strategy manager kind of does
some<00:00:52.110> nefarious<00:00:52.260> things<00:00:52.860> against<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> it's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
some nefarious things against you it's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it's it's pretty entertaining so all of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040 
it's it's pretty entertaining so all of
the<00:00:56.640> AI<00:00:56.790> in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> map<00:00:57.330> they're<00:00:57.570> constantly

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the AI in the map they're constantly

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.480 
the AI in the map they're constantly
trying<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.440> figure<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.770> what's<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.250> most

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
trying to figure out what's the most

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.950 
trying to figure out what's the most
intelligent<00:00:59.820> thing<00:01:00.150> they<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.840> doing

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
intelligent thing they need to be doing

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.690 
intelligent thing they need to be doing
at<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.200> point<00:01:01.470> they'll<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.130> defending

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
at that point they'll be defending

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.549 
at that point they'll be defending
they'll<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.090> reinforcing<00:01:03.720> walls<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.260> putting

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
they'll be reinforcing walls and putting

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
they'll be reinforcing walls and putting
barbed<00:01:04.830> wires<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.430> everything<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.030> they

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
barbed wires and everything that they

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
barbed wires and everything that they
have<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.660> protect<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> area<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.800> if

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have to do to protect the area and if

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
have to do to protect the area and if
you're<00:01:08.430> defending<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.270> they'll<00:01:09.480> be

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you're defending then they'll be

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.970 
you're defending then they'll be
attacking<00:01:10.050> you<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> same<00:01:10.770> tools

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980

that<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.310> preach<00:01:11.550> involved<00:01:12.030> rappelling

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
that we preach involved rappelling

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.390 
that we preach involved rappelling
through<00:01:12.510> windows<00:01:13.050> so<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.620> really<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.190> be

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
through windows so you really have to be

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
through windows so you really have to be
careful<00:01:14.730> about<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.750> things<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
careful about all of these things that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
careful about all of these things that
you'd<00:01:16.440> be<00:01:16.710> tempted<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.190> do<00:01:17.370> against<00:01:17.610> them

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you'd be tempted to do against them

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
you'd be tempted to do against them
because<00:01:18.330> they'll<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.930> against<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.380> as

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
because they'll do that against you as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
say there's you know a few AI is in the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240 
say there's you know a few AI is in the
basement<00:01:24.240> they'll<00:01:25.020> actually<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
basement they'll actually go out the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
basement they'll actually go out the
exits<00:01:26.550> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.760> basement<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.360> hide<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:28.050> one<00:01:28.650> of

exits of the basement and hide by one of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
exits of the basement and hide by one of
the<00:01:28.800> doors<00:01:29.010> leading<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> exterior<00:01:30.090> of
