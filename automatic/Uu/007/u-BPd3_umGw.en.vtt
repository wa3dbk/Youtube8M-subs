00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.140
 We were yesterday 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.000
 Let's get away now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.829
 Yesterday or today was actually 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.020
 Everything today and we were there full on 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 celebrate the club then from time to time 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.470
 came out again and more too 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.390
 got drunk and in the club again something to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 brought a drink and that was easy 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.049
 a horny music was cool with friends 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.810
 was just hammer must say really 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.729
 That was one of the best nights and he 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.590
 has just made right bock unfortunately 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 Although other colleagues did not come from us 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.930
 It was a bit stupid but there 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.490
 you can not do anything that was that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.610
 I was honest really shit though 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.420
 what should one do and that one means 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.310
 also goes in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.799
 we really have to be like that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 yes, we plan on thinking we wanted one 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.619
 other club rhine but they have one too 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.049
 no longer wanted bock home is 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 and that's why we're easy 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.930
 went in to say exactly so that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.979
 you try the other club but the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.079
 did not want anymore 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.000
 yes and then we will make a stop in there with 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 Annie and another friend but 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.810
 already on the picture with the post 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.530
 There he is patrick times 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.159
 funny on it and so you naldo 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 pulled next to Baumann and all you 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.420
 and yes we have been at home so far at half 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.829
 eight or at half past eight you think about it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.149
 At half past seven I was usually at home 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.119
 I go to sleep then 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.590
 usually I get up then I was 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.750
 at half past eight at home 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.069
 I had set the alarm for 11 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 That should be really good weather 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.230
 then I wanted to be a bit 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.180
 outside 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
 but that somehow became everything 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.480
 nothing then i have until no 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.610
 idea how much I have I slept 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.410
 have three or so yes and now I am 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 actually a bit fitter again 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 but today there are no 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.890
 Fighter I like her today 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.049
 puke out properly broken 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.459
 still and tonight's everybody 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.080
 fall into bed sooner I have to go now 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.450
 still preparing for abi me 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.569
 that's where it's coming soon and that 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 You can look around who I would 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.069
 also likes to play or coach care 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.599
 i 'm too bad yeah they look good 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.560
 I have one with his parents 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.280
 opened yesterday 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.019
 these fans you know yes and me 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.549
 must now for the abi has two weeks left 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.769
 then it starts on Monday writes the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.769
 first everything in a week really blatant 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.360
 on monday i write english 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.040
 then on Wednesday, I think 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.629
 with maths or geography on friday 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.700
 then it comes with matt somehow so 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.099
 either friday is geography or with 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.040
 from geography and math why so my 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.450
 abi subjects math and geography 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.730
 yes and there I have in any case 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.859
 unlearn properly 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.500
 because without learning no diligence no price 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.090
 my friends so is the claim 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.130
 you should stick to it because without 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.620
 she is simply not ready 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.959
 my front notes are pretty good the treasures 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.940
 ranges from a like 20 to 22 do 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.010
 Much has also asked me what you mean 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.900
 favorite subject is my favorite subject 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.930
 actually sports but I think so too 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.849
 geography is pretty cool and we have the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.150
 cd was west in any case you can 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.700
 use for our league bbva team 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.169
 and yes, I think sports of course 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.450
 hottest subject ballport there it can 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.690
 Simply usually plays football anyway 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.760
 basketball volleyball badminton 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.980
 table tennis and is just my things 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.690
 Of course the sports are clear 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.400
 that just the hottest I want too 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.630
 then study sports and 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.980
 German so geography can not 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.299
 to studying I would definitely 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.519
 the two subjects but it is unfortunately 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.139
 not because of that German as 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.669
 sport honestly you're going to a ball 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.799
 sometime after two years you will be 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.980
 In the job then the ball becomes a Saxon 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.540
 plays an hour or even it is yes 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.159
 then they should play with that 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.889
 apple spritzer but then we already have 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.909
 how can that be 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.289
 sometimes more space on the 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:25.210
 transferliste how do we do that 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.819
 do something right now 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.719
 so what infobox objectifiable contract 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.669
 I would say 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.770
 you can be apple spritzer 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.080
 sell yes and i would say we 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.249
 then make another pack and that was it 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.689
 then even when I do not remember 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.189
 what should tell me everything now 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.029
 somehow everything then someday 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.349
 hope that was a bit 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.210
 interesting for you you are welcome 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.710

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.560

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.629
 but I'll do it again 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.319

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.250
 Now we are the last effects 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.169
 I do not know it very much anyway 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.599

 for your team on passive is yes 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.150
 that means they will all soon be one 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.529
 a little bit more expensive can be constant 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.509
