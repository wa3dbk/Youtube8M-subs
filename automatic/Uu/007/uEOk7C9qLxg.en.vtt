00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
tingling really badly but after I died

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850 
tingling really badly but after I died
it<00:02:31.510> all<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.750> tangling<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.379> just<00:02:33.590> went<00:02:33.769> away

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
it all the tangling like just went away

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.670 
it all the tangling like just went away
I<00:02:34.299> what<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:35.329> did<00:02:35.629> cuz<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.170> wasn't<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
I what I did cuz it wasn't like the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.259 
I what I did cuz it wasn't like the
blacklist<00:02:37.190> tangling<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.909> blonde<00:02:38.120> I

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
blacklist tangling it was the blonde I

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.780 
blacklist tangling it was the blonde I
was<00:02:38.390> tingling<00:02:38.659> so<00:02:38.959> I'm<00:02:39.079> guessing<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.790> maybe

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
was tingling so I'm guessing that maybe

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.940 
was tingling so I'm guessing that maybe
it<00:02:41.540> was<00:02:41.659> like<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> blunt<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.349> don't<00:02:42.500> know<00:02:42.739> I

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
don't even know what to think but all I

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.250 
don't even know what to think but all I

did notice though when i finished dying
the<00:05:09.889> hair<00:05:09.919> was<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:12.470> curl<00:05:12.710> pattern<00:05:13.419> sadly

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419
