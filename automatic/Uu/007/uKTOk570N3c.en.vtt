 one thing 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.869
 grow up with two moms or two dads 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.369
 while politics and society do 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.810
 they share on the question of marriage 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.490
 and adoption for couples 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.259
 homosexuals with the theme of gay couples 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.000
 he also ended up on the Ariston stage a 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.039
 sanremo this is a reality that already 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.410
 it exists in the country and concerns thousands 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.890
 people like Silvia catherine their 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.130
 child 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.350
 in 2009 arrived andrea we are 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.989
 go to holland for an insemination 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.739
 therefore abroad unfortunately in Italy 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.450
 can not be done 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.489
 a choice to raise a child 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.930
 in a homosexual couple that besides the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.059
 normal difficulties of being parents 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.859
 also clashes with obstacles that 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.140
 they come from society and families 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.239
 yet they say silvia and caterina also in 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.829
 a provincial reality like pozzuoli le 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.960
 people most often show themselves 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.899
 welcoming to their decision 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.210
 g difficulties we have not had 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.850
 some work colleagues a little more 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.960
 hesitant at the beginning maybe anyway 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.750
 precisely seeing andrea its evolution 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 in growth I have not had any 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.040
 in short, no doubt he never asked us 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 nothing they told us many times 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.820
 you are more normal than families 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.140
 so called normal 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 the main topic of those who oppose it 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.010
 adoption for homosexual couples e 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.600
 the risk that the child can see 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.940
 his psychological growth compromised 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.860
 a definitive word on this can 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.330
 arriving only from science in the meantime 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 even at the kindergarten attended by the little one 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.020
 where the teachers preferred not to 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.790
 appearing on video ensure that the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.150
 child grows neither more nor less like him 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.620
 others 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.430
 to the question that was asked 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.000
 lately from a friend like you never 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.280
 he is not a dad 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.900
 he replied but I have two moms a 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.900
 dog because his family is that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.159
