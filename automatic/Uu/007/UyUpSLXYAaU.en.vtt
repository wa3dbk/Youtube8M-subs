00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 lioness a better face cougars that 's in 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 our analysis the game development 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 We do not respect all opinions as 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.210
 always some with fundamentals others without 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.370
 foundation well fine and we're fine this 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.720
 we have taken many parameters not from the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.650
 games that we had friendly too 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.489
 not just the start of the season 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.199
 trying to find us and have 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.780
 goal opportunities not later between the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.860
 continence us as strikers and 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.480
 responsible for each and every one of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.770
 we all do not arrive soon because 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.320
 we already know the calendar of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.850
 a long time ago then it seems it's the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 preseason not to try to get to the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.920
 100% in the first dates there is no 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 have some kind of justification in 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 how much to the rhythm of those things are we 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 well in that part physically and in the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.210
 other 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.009
 I think football is going well 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 we also have a good coach and a 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.479
 tactical discipline thank God of the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.800
 football gives you rematches every weekend 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.190
 week then we have a great 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.380
 opportunity to reverse many things that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.060
 They passed on Sunday then we are 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.470
 preparing in a good way to be able 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.450
 make a great match 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.200
 if we know that it is a great team like 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.550
 this start well with a victory in 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.900
 house they will want to make strong 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.120
 but we are mentalized in what 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.160
 it touches us do their 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.200
 work correcting the mistakes that we 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.780
 they passed on Sunday and make a goal 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.580
 party if maybe there's a breakthrough 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.330
 spectacular by the sun or by the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.200
 fatigue but if you have to do 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.120
 a game and give it a hobby the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 demand is always to win and each end of 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.900
 week or local that visit 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.750
 then it is the encomienda that we have 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.570
 to go and get a good result 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.160
 and start adding three is going to be a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.060
 difficult complicated party but we're 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.590
 working for it and to get from the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.990
 better way on Sunday I think it's 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.270
 very important I do not think he touched me in 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.350
 that part and facing chivas was 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.360
 also a motivational game to play 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.670
 with a rival like chivas so 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.550
 represents by the history that it has and 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.489
 I think it's going to be a game this 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.890
 Intense difficult as how are our 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.790
 matches this attractive and I think it's 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.400
 import 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.900
 we know it's nice to add and play 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.599
 well not but good now for the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.329
 circumstances in the team that is me 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.909
 I think this does not matter how the 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.420
 points that exists is to add of whatever and 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.980
 I hope this Sunday is this for 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.120
 well for us not as something not 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.000
 we know it 's a very well-matched team 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.629
 very fast comes from winning querÃ©taro 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.939
 conscious we are in that they have 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.590
 great individualities players that 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.150
 good has a great career and great 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.920
 trajectory here in the country and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.780
 aware that we are a team 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.730
 very well directed and its field and its field 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.709
 its people this is difficult classic from 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.609
 then we know that in the end what 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.409
 what marks you here are the results 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.290
 we are looking for results by 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.299
 on top of anything else and good 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.620
 get three points in Seoul would be a blow 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.620
 very hard psychic 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.750
