 our revenue today is the turn of 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.110
 passion fruit and it looks like the recipe you go 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:24.070

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.180
 two boxes of cream and half 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.199
 cup of concentrated passion fruit juice 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.290
 a white chocolate tablet a packet 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:39.070
 mashed biscuit and a half cup of 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.729
 milk first step we will put 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.040
 a container of condensed milk 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:50.890
 I'm going to put the two 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.290
 milk cream boxes and also the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.210
 passion fruit juice with a half cup 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.729
 people are using it and then you can 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.339
 hit the mixer or hit with the 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.250
 hand until smooth 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.040
 done that you choose the container that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.590
 Do you want to ride your pavê and then us? 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.170
 start by putting a layer of the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:18.430
 passion fruit cream spreading so that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.560
 cover the whole bottom and then the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.320
 people will see with the biscuits 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.670
 so I 'm going to bathe here quickly in the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.160
 milk the wafer and we'll do it on 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.410
 this with all and then if you lack milk 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.400
 if you need to add you can 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.260
 add 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.159
 then you will here the rowing 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.040
 crackers one from the other and then there 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.370
 done that we cover again with 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.850
 a layer of passion fruit cream 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.280
 that covers all the cookies and 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.680
 so I'll come here by putting the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.930
 white chocolate I cut into small pieces 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.630
 I cut with the same hand but you can 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.450
 use a knife you can roll to stay 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.860
 more thin if you prefer 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.080
 and then after putting the chocolate 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.720
 White I'm going back with the eraser 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.979
 so I'm going to win again in the milk 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 cracker 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.890
 I'm going to put a row on one side 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.130
 the other and I will cover 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.209
 the passion fruit cream you make there 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.459
 this until all its ingredient ends 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.500
 depending on the size of your shape or the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.510
 What the heck are you using? 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.380
 or less layers of mine just gave these two 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.690
 layers 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
 done that we take to freeze 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.470
 while he 's in the fridge the people 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.070
 will make panties to decorate 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.650
 I'm going to use a passion fruit half a cup here. 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.650
 of water and 3 tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:54.150
 then we put in a little clique the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:03:00.840
 three tablespoons of sugar to a half cup of 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 water and passion fruit pulp 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.620
 [Music] 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.140
 we 'll take it on the fire until 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.870
 he gave a dançadinha you will 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.390
 stir until the sugar dissolves all over 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.910
 and he's going to give a funny light 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.740
 remembering that after it cools 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.930
 thicken more then you can stop 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.130
 when you have more or less like this 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.020
 consistency 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.270
 We 'll leave this claudia there. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.820
 A little love for me will put it on 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.560
 hot on the pavement and then you make the 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.360
 way of decoration you want I 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.300
 I'll put it well spread out here. 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.160
 I want it to cover all my pavé and then I 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.250
 I'm going to shake it here. 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.770
 natural way to reach the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.680
 places that still the claudinha did not cover 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.810
 and then again it takes to freeze for more or 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.590
 less than half an hour already affects cold weather 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.550
 your tail is ready our pavement of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.560
 passion fruit 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.280
