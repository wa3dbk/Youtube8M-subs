00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
hello Jesse or a GPS city I'm going to

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.049 
hello Jesse or a GPS city I'm going to
show<00:00:06.229> you<00:00:06.290> the<00:00:06.470> map<00:00:06.740> screen<00:00:07.069> of<00:00:07.190> the<00:00:07.310> GPS<00:00:07.790> map

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
show you the map screen of the GPS map

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.690 
show you the map screen of the GPS map
62<00:00:08.930> series<00:00:10.809> the<00:00:11.809> maps<00:00:12.099> actually<00:00:13.099> read<00:00:13.340> really

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
62 series the maps actually read really

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.030 
62 series the maps actually read really
great<00:00:14.059> compared<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.080> 60<00:00:15.440> series<00:00:15.740> which

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
great compared to the 60 series which

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.040 
great compared to the 60 series which
this<00:00:16.279> one<00:00:16.460> replaces<00:00:16.939> it's<00:00:17.689> got<00:00:17.840> a<00:00:17.869> higher

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
this one replaces it's got a higher

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.749 
this one replaces it's got a higher
resolution<00:00:18.320> screen<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.160> everything<00:00:19.550> is

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
resolution screen so everything is

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.240 
resolution screen so everything is
easier<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.360> read<00:00:20.710> when<00:00:21.710> looking<00:00:21.980> at<00:00:22.099> the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
easier to read when looking at the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.100 
easier to read when looking at the
screen<00:00:22.640> we<00:00:22.849> have<00:00:22.880> a<00:00:23.060> little<00:00:23.119> bar<00:00:23.540> at<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.869> top

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
screen we have a little bar at the top

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.639 
screen we have a little bar at the top
there

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:24.649 
there

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.220 
there
that's<00:00:24.860> our<00:00:25.070> scale<00:00:25.520> bar<00:00:25.820> it's<00:00:26.390> gonna<00:00:26.630> tell<00:00:26.989> us

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
that's our scale bar it's gonna tell us

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.060 
that's our scale bar it's gonna tell us
currently<00:00:28.160> right<00:00:28.340> now<00:00:28.369> that<00:00:28.700> 200<00:00:29.300> feet<00:00:29.660> is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
currently right now that 200 feet is

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.560 
currently right now that 200 feet is
approximately<00:00:31.809> 3/4<00:00:32.809> inch<00:00:33.020> on<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.070> screen

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
approximately 3/4 inch on the screen

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.970 
approximately 3/4 inch on the screen
then<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:35.720> have<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:35.900> little<00:00:36.110> white<00:00:36.380> arrow<00:00:36.680> there

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
then we have a little white arrow there

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.460 
then we have a little white arrow there
that's<00:00:37.190> our<00:00:37.370> North<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.880> Decatur<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.780> points

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
that's our North and Decatur it points

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.470 
that's our North and Decatur it points
towards<00:00:39.950> North<00:00:40.310> currently<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.030> units<00:00:41.330> in

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
towards North currently the units in

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.410 
towards North currently the units in
track<00:00:41.810> up<00:00:42.080> so<00:00:42.740> your<00:00:43.100> current<00:00:43.520> direction<00:00:44.390> of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
track up so your current direction of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.940 
track up so your current direction of
movement<00:00:44.930> is<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.830> top<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.340> screen<00:00:47.920> we<00:00:48.920> can

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
movement is the top of the screen we can

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.520 
movement is the top of the screen we can
see<00:00:49.280> some<00:00:49.490> track<00:00:49.820> data<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.480> some<00:00:50.780> map<00:00:50.990> data<00:00:51.290> on

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
see some track data and some map data on

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.979 
see some track data and some map data on
the<00:00:51.650> screen<00:00:51.950> also<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:53.120> could<00:00:53.300> customize<00:00:53.780> this

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the screen also we could customize this

here<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.970> compass<00:03:34.970> at<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.389> top<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.959> screen

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
here a compass at the top of the screen

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.160 
here a compass at the top of the screen
along<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.459> some<00:03:37.940> information<00:03:38.269> needed<00:03:39.049> to

along with some information needed to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.620 
along with some information needed to
find<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.680> geocache<00:03:39.950> like<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.609> distance<00:03:41.060> from

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
find the geocache like the distance from

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:50.089 
find the geocache like the distance from
your<00:03:41.930> location<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.829> cache

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.420 

and<00:03:50.640> then<00:03:50.730> we<00:03:50.849> could<00:03:50.999> also<00:03:51.150> do<00:03:51.390> for<00:03:51.659> small<00:03:52.430> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and then we could also do for small to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.179 
and then we could also do for small to
small<00:03:53.640> or<00:03:54.060> one<00:03:54.269> large<00:03:54.599> data<00:03:54.989> fields<00:03:55.499> I'll<00:03:55.920> show

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
small or one large data fields I'll show

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.949 
small or one large data fields I'll show
you<00:03:56.249> what<00:03:56.459> for<00:03:56.760> small<00:03:57.090> looks<00:03:57.359> like<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.780> how<00:03:57.930> to

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
you what for small looks like and how to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.069 
you what for small looks like and how to
change<00:03:58.469> the<00:03:58.769> data<00:03:58.950> fields<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:03.299> in<00:04:03.450> for<00:04:03.719> small

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
change the data fields so in for small

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.929 
change the data fields so in for small
you'll<00:04:04.349> see<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.709> have<00:04:04.739> four<00:04:05.400> small<00:04:05.579> data

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939
