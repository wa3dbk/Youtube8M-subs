these exercises basically are meant to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.840 
these exercises basically are meant to
allow<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.870> consciously<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.850> relatively

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
allow you to consciously and relatively

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
allow you to consciously and relatively
quickly<00:00:37.100> exercise<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.610> seven<00:00:39.120> main<00:00:39.690> joints

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.710 

you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.720> put<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.260> tongue<00:00:55.790> at<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:57.240> top

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
you have to put your tongue at the top

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.050 
you have to put your tongue at the top
of<00:00:57.990> your<00:00:58.020> hard<00:00:58.380> palate<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
of your hard palate and it's like a

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.650 
of your hard palate and it's like a
switch<00:01:00.540> it<00:01:01.170> connects<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.430> energy<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.630> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
switch it connects that energy so as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.260 
switch it connects that energy so as
you're<00:01:04.050> breathing<00:01:04.400> you're<00:01:05.400> circulating

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you're breathing you're circulating

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.010 
you're breathing you're circulating
energy<00:01:06.890> anytime<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.130> breathing<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.990> are

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
energy anytime you're breathing you are

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.180 
energy anytime you're breathing you are
bringing<00:01:10.830> vitality<00:01:11.690> into<00:01:12.690> your<00:01:13.260> body<00:01:13.500> I'm

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
bringing vitality into your body I'm

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.670 
bringing vitality into your body I'm
paying<00:01:14.729> attention<00:01:14.910> to<00:01:15.510> three<00:01:16.020> different

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
paying attention to three different

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.050 
paying attention to three different
circles<00:01:17.960> there's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.050> circle<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> energy<00:01:20.190> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
circles there's a circle of energy that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.740 
circles there's a circle of energy that
involves<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:22.170> legs<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.010> feet<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:24.479> moves

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
involves my legs and my feet that moves

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
involves my legs and my feet that moves
through<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> earth<00:01:25.520> there's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.640> circle<00:01:27.149> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
through the earth there's a circle of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.680 
through the earth there's a circle of
energy<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.140> engages<00:01:28.649> my<00:01:29.580> hips<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.300> waist

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
energy that engages my hips and my waist

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.810 
energy that engages my hips and my waist
and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.560> final<00:01:31.979> circle<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.580> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then the final circle is the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
and then the final circle is the
movement<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> joint<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.229> you're

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
movement of the joint that you're

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
movement of the joint that you're
working<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.640> you're<00:01:35.820> trying<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.300> do<00:01:36.509> is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
working and what you're trying to do is

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
working and what you're trying to do is
to<00:01:37.320> find<00:01:37.649> those<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.250> circles<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to find those three circles and the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.600 
to find those three circles and the
natural<00:01:39.840> movement<00:01:40.350> associated<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:41.399> them

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
natural movement associated with them

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.139 
natural movement associated with them
and<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.570> connect<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.800> all<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:44.789> in<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and then connect them all so that in the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
and then connect them all so that in the
end<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> complete<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> movement<00:01:47.250> like

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
end when you complete the movement like

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.490 
end when you complete the movement like
the<00:01:47.520> movement<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.270> shoulder<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the movement with your shoulder it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.620 
the movement with your shoulder it
actually<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.310> connecting<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> earth

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
actually is connecting with the earth

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually is connecting with the earth
everything<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.830> symmetrical<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
everything is symmetrical so with the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
everything is symmetrical so with the
knees<00:01:54.660> together<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.410> have<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> particular

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
knees together I have a particular

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
knees together I have a particular
rotation<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.319> moving<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.920> which<00:01:59.100> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
rotation that I'm moving in which is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.040 
rotation that I'm moving in which is
counterclockwise<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.539> then<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:00.810> move

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
counterclockwise and then I move

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.040 
counterclockwise and then I move
clockwise<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:02.880> open<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.569> knees<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.990> do

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
clockwise and then I open my knees I do

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.760 
clockwise and then I open my knees I do
the<00:02:04.440> same<00:02:04.709> thing<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.819> then<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.410> do<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.440> in<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the same thing and then I do it in the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.570 
the same thing and then I do it in the
opposite<00:02:08.280> direction

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.780 

get<00:02:13.580> down<00:02:13.970> here

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
