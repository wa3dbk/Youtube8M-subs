00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.310
 and of course also build the center of 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.770
 pussy of the gamboa tower in the jump 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.090
 the referee was signaling a foul 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.370
 Miguel Angel Gamboa is protesting 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.210
 go shock there you saw it 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.580
 and there the culprit of the action is the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.939
 referee I do not know what strange attitude 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.939
 I take 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.790
 gamboa day claimed a lack that 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.950
 noted the referee Jorge Alberto Narv치ez 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.930
 but the sprint of Jorge Narv치ez 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.700
 void is usual and crashed against 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.430
 Miguel Angel Gamboa this game and clear 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.079
 here we will see everything 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.149
 and in the center of the tower 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.470
 the referee points out the lack of Miguel 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:54.380
 gamboa angel in that gamboa jump claims 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.450
 to the referee the cancellation of that auction 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.840
 that pillar king is also already had 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.210
 neutralized and then the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.680
 sprint 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 because when seeing with aroma 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.259
 and materially stream to Miguel Angel 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.729
 there is a collision between the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.640
 referee and the player that fernando 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.020
 schwartz and saw very close by collision 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.090
 the one that had the referee Jorge Alberto 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.679
 narvaez with giving him the gamboa the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.969
 referee because Alberto Narv치ez hurt 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.009
 of the left clavicle already 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.390
 incorporated but miguel angel gamboa pena 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.219
 is coming to its senses after the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.020
 shock that the referee had asked for 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.149
 renewal of the match and it is the first 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.709
 once we see this here on the court he 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.939
 is here Miguel Angel Gamboa is 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.340
 wants to approach to claim the referee 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.630
 osvaldo vil faria stops him and it's better 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.789
 that is here because the Chilean is very 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.890
 temperamental and wanted to claim the 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.720
 referee a very strange move 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.819
 go to the end that got the referee jorge 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.979
 Alberto Narv치ez an attitude of how you 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.479
 mentioned was strange because I do not 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.290
 I had to get to you if there was 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.480
 marked the play 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.909
 to put Miguel miguel gamboa in motion 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.100
 I had claimed 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.310
 15 good subject of him and here the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.310
 pranksters 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.750
 in the tribune that never fail ask for the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.250
 red card for the referee from the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 take out miguel angel gamboa good the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.080
