00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.690
 Hello, let's look at the topic soap and washing 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.580
 facilities 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.910
 general concept 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.790
 soap is a mixture of salts from sodium solid 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.110
 soap and potassium liquid soap us us 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:30.110
 let's look at their formulas 1 formula with 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.080
 sodium dented sodium because 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.320
 derived from palmitic acid 2 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.650
 sodium stearate from stearic acid and 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.140
 Ali from sodium from oleic acid is 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.250
 solid soap but that doesn't mean three 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.479
 together in the soap is a can and one by one 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.640
 and may vary by 2 different or all 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.070
 three 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.400
 consider liquid soap is the same from those 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.809
 most acids only metal potassium 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.560
 Memo whether I steal potassium olya I wove 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.700
 can all be in this soap too 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.640
 or maybe one formula or two 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.220
 different getting soap for soap making 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.000
 uses a mixture of animal and vegetable 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.850
 fat 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.150
 cooking soap is a chemical process he 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.330
 called saponification or hydrolysis of fat 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.930
 when heated with water alkali and soda 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.140
 reactions when receiving soap the following 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.780
 take solid fat 3 stearin and act 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.540
 we get water 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.240
 glycerin and stearic acid then on 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.110
 stearic acid act alkali 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.690
 your sodium, or if it turns into soap 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.980
 In this case, sodium stearate is solid 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.170
 soap or act soda on 323 nasty on 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.110
 stearic acid we get 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.720
 stearate sodium solid soap water and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.750
 carbon dioxide 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.360
 hydrolysis soap it comes with washing 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.599
 substances sodium stearate under the action 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.120
 water is a reversible process and it turns out 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.120
 we have stearic acid and alkali
