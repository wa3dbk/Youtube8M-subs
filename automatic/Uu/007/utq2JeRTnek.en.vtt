modes<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> use<00:01:47.460> three<00:01:47.759> new<00:01:47.970> weapons<00:01:48.390> which

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
modes we can use three new weapons which

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.319 
modes we can use three new weapons which
is<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> tommy<00:01:48.990> gun<00:01:49.340> snub-nosed<00:01:50.340> pistol<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is a tommy gun snub-nosed pistol and a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.679 
is a tommy gun snub-nosed pistol and a
Molotov<00:01:51.810> cocktail<00:01:52.640> now<00:01:53.640> those<00:01:54.149> three<00:01:54.540> new

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
Molotov cocktail now those three new

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
Molotov cocktail now those three new
weapons<00:01:55.020> I'll<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.350> over<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.490> Tommy

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
weapons I'll go over them now the Tommy

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.800 
weapons I'll go over them now the Tommy
gun<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:58.009> think<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.610> like<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> SMG

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
gun I think is going to be like the SMG

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.440 
gun I think is going to be like the SMG
but<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.500> powerful<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.130> rounds<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.210> more

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
but more powerful more rounds and more

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.679 
but more powerful more rounds and more
kick<00:02:03.719> back<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.130> mix<00:02:06.000> between<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
kick back so be a mix between that and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.229 
kick back so be a mix between that and
lmg<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.680> mix<00:02:07.979> between<00:02:08.099> those<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.640> guns<00:02:08.879> so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
lmg so mix between those kind of guns so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.639 
lmg so mix between those kind of guns so
be<00:02:09.479> more<00:02:09.720> powerful<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.530> I've<00:02:10.590> been

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
be more powerful which is what I've been

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430 
be more powerful which is what I've been
looking<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.550> machine<00:02:11.910> gun<00:02:12.300> so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
looking for in a machine gun so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.540 
looking for in a machine gun so
definitely<00:02:13.920> looking<00:02:14.070> forward<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> see<00:02:14.520> what

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
definitely looking forward to see what

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.890 
definitely looking forward to see what
that<00:02:14.730> time<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.720> some

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that time you going can do to some

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540 
that time you going can do to some
players<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:16.740> can<00:02:16.890> mess<00:02:17.040> them<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.340> in

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
players see if they can mess them up in

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.370 
players see if they can mess them up in
a<00:02:17.640> couple<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.970> shots<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:19.110> we've<00:02:19.230> got<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
a couple of shots then we've got a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.960 
a couple of shots then we've got a
snubnose<00:02:19.890> pistol<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.520> I'm<00:02:20.700> kind<00:02:20.910> of

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
snubnose pistol which I'm kind of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.480 
snubnose pistol which I'm kind of
thinking<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.590> concealed<00:02:23.160> pistol

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
thinking is a is a concealed pistol

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.460 
thinking is a is a concealed pistol
which<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.970> can<00:02:24.090> hide<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.630> your<00:02:24.690> jacket<00:02:25.290> pocket

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
which you can hide in your jacket pocket

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.400 
which you can hide in your jacket pocket
or<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.420> sleeve<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:28.050> jacket

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
or your your the sleeve of your jacket

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.170 
or your your the sleeve of your jacket
easily<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.550> mean<00:02:29.730> there'll<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:29.910> less

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
easily so it mean there'll be less

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.340 
easily so it mean there'll be less
powerful<00:02:30.510> than<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> pistol<00:02:31.080> we've<00:02:31.170> already

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
powerful than the pistol we've already

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.830 
powerful than the pistol we've already
got<00:02:31.710> but<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.490> should<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.760> faster<00:02:33.330> fire<00:02:33.570> rate

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
got but it should be faster fire rate

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.470 
got but it should be faster fire rate
and<00:02:33.960> probably<00:02:34.500> over<00:02:34.950> more<00:02:35.220> rounds<00:02:35.760> or<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and probably over more rounds or the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480 
and probably over more rounds or the
same<00:02:36.780> I'm<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.890> sure<00:02:37.950> which<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.460> but

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
same I'm not sure which one but

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.750 
same I'm not sure which one but
hopefully<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.210> more<00:02:39.270> realms<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.760> bit

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
hopefully it's more realms and bit

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880 
hopefully it's more realms and bit
faster<00:02:42.270> fire<00:02:42.480> right<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.930> then<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.710> got<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
faster fire right and then you got the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.440 
faster fire right and then you got the
Molotov<00:02:44.220> cocktail<00:02:44.730> which<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Molotov cocktail which will be like a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.750 
Molotov cocktail which will be like a
grenade<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.290> we'll<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.500> hopefully<00:02:47.460> set<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
grenade but we'll just hopefully set a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.880 
grenade but we'll just hopefully set a
big<00:02:47.940> area<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.360> fire<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.380> hopefully<00:02:49.710> set

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
big area on fire and hopefully set

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
big area on fire and hopefully set
people<00:02:50.070> on<00:02:50.250> fire<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.880> that'll<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:51.300> cool

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
people on fire that is that'll be cool

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.790 
people on fire that is that'll be cool
if<00:02:51.690> they've<00:02:51.840> run<00:02:51.960> run<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.260> fire<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.620> died

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
if they've run run on fire and died

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.900 
if they've run run on fire and died
after<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.220> go<00:02:53.310> two<00:02:53.370> seconds<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.550> got<00:02:56.730> those

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
after it go two seconds so you got those

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.570 
after it go two seconds so you got those
three<00:02:57.270> new<00:02:57.480> weapons<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.140> we've<00:02:58.440> got<00:02:58.680> two<00:02:59.370> new

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
three new weapons and we've got two new

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.330 
three new weapons and we've got two new
game<00:02:59.910> modes<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.530> I'll<00:03:01.620> start<00:03:01.860> off<00:03:02.010> with

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
game modes so I'll start off with

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.970 
game modes so I'll start off with
territories<00:03:03.060> which<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.020> kind<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.500> based<00:03:04.710> on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
territories which is kind of based on

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.180 
territories which is kind of based on
the<00:03:05.070> multi<00:03:05.910> Hill<00:03:06.410> gameplay<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:08.040> we've

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
the multi Hill gameplay that we've

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.520 
the multi Hill gameplay that we've
already<00:03:08.340> got<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.540> will<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.780> based<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
already got but it will be based in the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
already got but it will be based in the
two<00:03:10.710> new<00:03:10.920> maps<00:03:11.130> which<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.610> guard<00:03:11.850> go<00:03:12.000> in

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
two new maps which is a guard go in

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.400 
two new maps which is a guard go in
Alcatraz<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.870> it'll<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.290> two<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:15.150> bob<00:03:15.750> lands

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
Alcatraz and it'll be two to bob lands

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.670 
Alcatraz and it'll be two to bob lands
to<00:03:16.860> mobs<00:03:17.220> gangs<00:03:18.080> fighting<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.410> take<00:03:19.530> control

the map and you've taken control and the
more<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.010> control<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.550> more<00:03:32.760> point<00:03:33.120> you

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
more you control the more point you

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.120 
more you control the more point you
probably<00:03:33.239> get<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:34.110> will<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.860> quite

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
probably get so that's will be quite

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.720 
probably get so that's will be quite
cool<00:03:35.400> whatever<00:03:36.000> kind<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.700> capture<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
cool whatever kind of like capture the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.390 
cool whatever kind of like capture the
flag<00:03:38.820> capture<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.540> base<00:03:39.690> kind<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.400> take

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
flag capture the base kind of take

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.330 
flag capture the base kind of take
territories<00:03:42.239> which<00:03:42.810> will<00:03:42.989> be<00:03:43.110> make<00:03:43.890> gameplay

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
territories which will be make gameplay

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.090

more<00:03:45.500> what<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.739> call<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:48.410> more<00:03:49.410> change<00:03:49.739> ever

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
more what can I call it more change ever

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.699 
more what can I call it more change ever
changing<00:03:50.700> because<00:03:51.060> once<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.110> take<00:03:52.290> one<00:03:52.500> base

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
changing because once you take one base

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.199 
changing because once you take one base
they<00:03:52.950> could<00:03:53.100> take<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> base<00:03:53.430> behind<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
they could take a base behind you and

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.400 
they could take a base behind you and
then<00:03:54.300> you'll<00:03:54.450> have<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.690> change<00:03:55.050> where<00:03:55.320> you

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
then you'll have to change where you

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.979 
then you'll have to change where you
play<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:56.459> it's<00:03:56.790> never<00:03:57.090> consistent<00:03:57.840> of

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
what's going to happen in that game mode

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.440 
what's going to happen in that game mode

called<00:04:10.080> VIP<00:04:11.120> now<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.300> is<00:04:12.450> where<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.660> think<00:04:12.930> it

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
called VIP now this is where I think it

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
called VIP now this is where I think it
incorporates<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.769> new<00:04:13.920> character<00:04:14.190> class

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
incorporates a new character class

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.780 
incorporates a new character class
because<00:04:15.090> in<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.450> VIP<00:04:15.830> one<00:04:16.830> player<00:04:17.160> will<00:04:17.190> spawn

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
because in the VIP one player will spawn

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.070 
because in the VIP one player will spawn
as<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.540> mob<00:04:18.780> boss<00:04:19.040> I've<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.150> voxel<00:04:21.150> kalp<00:04:21.510> own<00:04:21.780> or

as a mob boss I've a voxel kalp own or
box<00:04:22.860> moron<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.970> think<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.390> think<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.900> said<00:04:25.050> like

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.100 
box moron I think I think it said like
that<00:04:25.320> those<00:04:26.100> two<00:04:26.340> but

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
that those two but

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.619 
that those two but
person<00:04:27.560> will<00:04:27.710> spawn<00:04:28.009> as<00:04:28.370> one<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.610> those<00:04:28.849> one

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
person will spawn as one of those one

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.149 
person will spawn as one of those one
boss<00:04:29.870> on<00:04:30.050> either<00:04:30.169> team<00:04:30.439> and<00:04:30.680> will<00:04:30.860> be<00:04:30.949> up<00:04:31.069> to

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
boss on either team and will be up to

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.980 
boss on either team and will be up to
the<00:04:31.250> rest<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.639> team<00:04:31.849> to<00:04:32.030> defend<00:04:32.569> them<00:04:32.840> and

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
the rest of the team to defend them and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.559 
the rest of the team to defend them and
up<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.039> other<00:04:34.189> team<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.639> do<00:04:34.789> kill<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
up to the other team to do kill the

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.649 
up to the other team to do kill the
opposite<00:04:36.020> boss<00:04:36.259> so<00:04:37.159> it's<00:04:37.580> protect<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.360> VIP

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
opposite boss so it's protect the VIP

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.379 
opposite boss so it's protect the VIP
and<00:04:39.139> I<00:04:39.740> think<00:04:40.069> the<00:04:40.370> new<00:04:40.490> character<00:04:40.939> class<00:04:41.120> will

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
and I think the new character class will

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.600 
and I think the new character class will
be<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.659> boss<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.259> don't<00:04:43.189> know<00:04:43.340> what<00:04:43.490> you'll

I I can't see him being the same as
every<00:05:00.860> other<00:05:00.889> class<00:05:01.129> because<00:05:01.580> if<00:05:01.729> he<00:05:01.819> is<00:05:01.849> he'll

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240
