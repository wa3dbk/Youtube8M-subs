that movie theater as well so I guess
people's<00:02:27.439> concern<00:02:27.829> is<00:02:28.129> that<00:02:29.170> random<00:02:30.170> people

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
people's concern is that random people

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.830 
people's concern is that random people
can<00:02:30.769> see<00:02:30.980> okay<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:31.430> person<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.209> also<00:02:32.420> at<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
movie theater with with me which I

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.119 
movie theater with with me which I
personally<00:02:35.329> don't<00:02:35.599> see<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.290> whole<00:02:36.530> concern

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
personally don't see the whole concern

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.360 
personally don't see the whole concern
in<00:02:37.489> in<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.780> rapists<00:02:39.560> trying<00:02:40.159> to<00:02:40.250> get

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
in in the the rapists trying to get

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.289 
in in the the rapists trying to get
everybody<00:02:40.819> out<00:02:40.909> there<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.730> had<00:02:44.000> some

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
everybody out there but I had some

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.699 
everybody out there but I had some
people<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:44.720> guess<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:45.079> that<00:02:45.230> though<00:02:45.409> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
people I guess think that though the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.670 
people I guess think that though the
reason<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.190> find<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.790> extremely<00:02:47.629> stupid<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.409> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
reason I find it extremely stupid is I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.559 
reason I find it extremely stupid is I
don't<00:02:48.799> know<00:02:49.069> why<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.670> reminds<00:02:50.120> me<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.269> some

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
don't know why but it reminds me of some

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.890 
don't know why but it reminds me of some

apparently<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:39.479> don't<00:04:39.659> even<00:04:39.840> know<00:04:40.050> where

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229

but<00:04:41.189> still<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.360> think<00:04:42.719> the<00:04:42.810> whole<00:04:42.900> idea<00:04:43.199> is

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
but still I just think the whole idea is

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.320 
but still I just think the whole idea is
kind<00:04:43.439> of<00:04:43.560> silly<00:04:43.740> I'm<00:04:44.189> sure<00:04:44.370> people<00:04:44.610> will<00:04:45.060> use

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
kind of silly I'm sure people will use

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.860 
kind of silly I'm sure people will use
it<00:04:45.360> it'll<00:04:45.659> become<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:46.020> fad<00:04:46.349> or<00:04:46.680> some<00:04:47.159> something

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
it it'll become a fad or some something

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.209 
it it'll become a fad or some something
but<00:04:48.870> anyway<00:04:49.139> that's<00:04:49.319> about<00:04:49.500> all<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.889> wanted<00:04:50.159> to
