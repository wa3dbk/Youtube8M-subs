00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
a good thing to know about taking your

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.950 
a good thing to know about taking your
clip<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.549> can<00:00:05.730> edit<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.509> camera

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
clip is that you can edit in the camera

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.629 
clip is that you can edit in the camera
and<00:00:07.109> that's<00:00:07.350> usually<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.799> fastest<00:00:08.400> easiest

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
and that's usually the fastest easiest

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.990 
and that's usually the fastest easiest
way<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> edit<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:11.010> could<00:00:11.190> practice<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> if

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
way to edit so you could practice and if

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759 
way to edit so you could practice and if
you<00:00:12.090> don't<00:00:12.269> like<00:00:12.450> what<00:00:12.480> you're<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.590> saw

you don't like what you're what you saw

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.189 
you don't like what you're what you saw
then<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:16.310> reverse<00:00:17.310> your<00:00:17.580> camera<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
then you just reverse your camera and

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.620 
then you just reverse your camera and
rerecord<00:00:19.199> over<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> until<00:00:20.400> you're<00:00:21.180> looking<00:00:21.510> at

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
rerecord over it until you're looking at

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
something called a firewire I believe

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.619 
something called a firewire I believe
this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> only<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> only

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
this is the only way to do it's the only

this is the only way to do it's the only
way<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.870> how<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.710> using

a<00:00:41.250> video<00:00:41.910> camera<00:00:42.149> webcam<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.320> something

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
a video camera webcam is something

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
a video camera webcam is something
different<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.239> look<00:00:45.360> at

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
different and that has if you look at

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
different and that has if you look at
this<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.649> end<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this this there's this one end that's a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.940 
this this there's this one end that's a
USB<00:00:47.760> port<00:00:48.120> most<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.780> us<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> pretty

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
USB port most of us if we have a pretty

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.119 
USB port most of us if we have a pretty
modern<00:00:50.430> computer<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> USB<00:00:52.710> port<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
modern computer know what a USB port is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.330 
modern computer know what a USB port is
and<00:00:53.660> then<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.590> different

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and then this one is a little different

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.860 
and then this one is a little different
and<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.030> why<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.539> called<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and so this is why it's called a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650 
and so this is why it's called a
firewire<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.280> might<00:00:59.489> want<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.180> how

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
firewire and you might want to see how

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.319 
firewire and you might want to see how
that<00:01:00.960> shape<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.879> sure<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that shape is and make sure that you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 
that shape is and make sure that you
have<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.019> those<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.460> might<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> buy

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
have one of those you might have to buy

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.020 
have one of those you might have to buy
it<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.619> ask<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.310> firewire

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it and that you would ask for a firewire

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.130 
it and that you would ask for a firewire
and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.510> small<00:01:12.869> little

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and then so this one this small little

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.560 
and then so this one this small little
plug<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.740> plugs<00:01:14.189> into<00:01:14.430> your<00:01:14.580> camera<00:01:15.119> but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
plug it plugs into your camera but

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
plug it plugs into your camera but
you're<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.710> camera<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you're going to look at your camera and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.580 
you're going to look at your camera and
find<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.850> hole<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.479> look<00:01:18.750> maybe<00:01:19.049> look<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.409> your

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
find a hole and look maybe look at your

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
find a hole and look maybe look at your
manual<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> find<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.990> hole<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
manual and find a little hole like that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.850 
manual and find a little hole like that
not<00:01:22.950> nearly<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.549> wide<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> USB<00:01:25.409> ports

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
not nearly as wide as the USB ports

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
not nearly as wide as the USB ports
picture<00:01:26.700> you'll<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.299> my<00:01:27.600> camera<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> left

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
picture you'll see my camera on the left

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
picture you'll see my camera on the left
and<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.100> computer<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.360> upper<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and my computer on the upper right the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.340 
and my computer on the upper right the
smaller<00:01:32.340> end<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> firewire<00:01:33.630> goes<00:01:34.020> into

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
smaller end of the firewire goes into

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.100 
smaller end of the firewire goes into
the<00:01:34.500> camera<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.490> case<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.840> where

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the camera in my case you can see where

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.899 
the camera in my case you can see where
that<00:01:37.140> plugs<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.070> your<00:01:38.250> camera<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:38.790> be

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that plugs in but your camera will be

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.230 
that plugs in but your camera will be
different<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.680> larger<00:01:41.189> USB<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
different and the other larger USB and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
different and the other larger USB and
it<00:01:42.630> goes<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:43.079> your<00:01:43.320> computer<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it goes into your computer there's a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
it goes into your computer there's a
close-up<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.509> how<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.960> USB<00:01:46.290> plug<00:01:46.740> goes<00:01:47.040> in

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
close-up of how that USB plug goes in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
close-up of how that USB plug goes in
there<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.390> you'll<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:48.780> me<00:01:48.960> sitting<00:01:49.229> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
there and then you'll see me sitting in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
there and then you'll see me sitting in
front<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.799> my<00:01:49.950> camera<00:01:50.280> which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> mounted<00:01:50.939> on

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
front of my camera which is mounted on
