definitely<00:01:52.020> odd<00:01:52.460> tasting<00:01:53.460> green<00:01:54.090> apple

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
definitely odd tasting green apple

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.499 
definitely odd tasting green apple
inside<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.070> an<00:01:56.159> Oriole<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
inside of an Oriole but I like it it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
inside of an Oriole but I like it it
works<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.899> well<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> caramel<00:01:58.619> works

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
works really well with the caramel works

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.800 
works really well with the caramel works
just<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.549> good<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> regular<00:02:00.180> caramel<00:02:00.509> apple

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
just as good as a regular caramel apple

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.209 
just as good as a regular caramel apple
actually<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.770> might<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> little

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
actually I think this might be a little

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
actually I think this might be a little
bit<00:02:02.369> better<00:02:02.460> than<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.729> caramel<00:02:03.090> apple<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.509> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
bit better than a caramel apple but I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.289 
bit better than a caramel apple but I
will<00:02:03.990> give<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.500> high<00:02:05.250> four<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.610> five<00:02:05.850> I'm

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
will give it a high four out of five I'm

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
will give it a high four out of five I'm
actually<00:02:06.509> pretty<00:02:06.780> impressed<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
actually pretty impressed with this I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770 
actually pretty impressed with this I
didn't<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.179> flavor<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
didn't think this would be a flavor that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
didn't think this would be a flavor that
could<00:02:09.989> work<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> any<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.190> surprisingly

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
could work in any way but surprisingly

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.700 
could work in any way but surprisingly
caramel<00:02:12.270> apple<00:02:12.660> oreo<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> really

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
caramel apple oreo have a really

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.250 
caramel apple oreo have a really
nice<00:02:13.830> creamy<00:02:14.220> texture<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.600> regular<00:02:15.840> Oreo

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
nice creamy texture like a regular Oreo

nice creamy texture like a regular Oreo
does<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.830> i<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.210> goes<00:02:18.360> through

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
does and i like that it goes through

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.240 
does and i like that it goes through
stages<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.740> caramel<00:02:20.220> apple

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
stages it's not just a caramel apple

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.250 
stages it's not just a caramel apple
it's<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.180> bit<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> caramel<00:02:21.690> than<00:02:21.960> apple

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
it's a little bit of caramel than apple

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.540 
it's a little bit of caramel than apple
at<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.470> end<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> say

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
at the end it's not much more to say

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.830 
at the end it's not much more to say
about<00:02:23.700> other<00:02:24.000> than<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.210> actually<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.720> this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
