what do you usually get paid for
babysitting<00:06:16.770> our<00:06:17.159> general<00:06:17.939> idea<00:06:18.300> is<00:06:18.689> if<00:06:19.379> they

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
babysitting our general idea is if they

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.219 
babysitting our general idea is if they
have<00:06:19.800> three<00:06:20.219> kids<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.759> under<00:06:21.120> just<00:06:21.689> say<00:06:21.900> four

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
have three kids and under just say four

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.080 
have three kids and under just say four
or<00:06:22.259> five<00:06:22.379> dollars<00:06:22.680> an<00:06:23.009> hour<00:06:23.159> and<00:06:23.490> if<00:06:23.699> they<00:06:23.909> have

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
or five dollars an hour and if they have

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.770 
or five dollars an hour and if they have
three<00:06:24.960> kids<00:06:25.169> and<00:06:25.439> above<00:06:25.849> say<00:06:26.849> it's<00:06:27.330> usually<00:06:27.569> a

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
three kids and above say it's usually a

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.700 
three kids and above say it's usually a
dollar<00:06:28.050> an<00:06:28.349> hour<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:28.919> dollar<00:06:29.250> per<00:06:29.580> kid<00:06:29.819> so

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
dollar an hour and a dollar per kid so

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.260 
dollar an hour and a dollar per kid so
that's<00:06:31.710> our<00:06:31.889> general<00:06:32.280> consensus<00:06:32.879> for<00:06:33.090> money

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
that's our general consensus for money

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.540 
that's our general consensus for money
but<00:06:33.719> not<00:06:34.050> everyone<00:06:34.440> has<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.830> do<00:06:34.979> that<00:06:35.129> yeah
