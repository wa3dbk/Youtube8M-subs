for setting light goes anywhere from two

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.550 
for setting light goes anywhere from two
lumens<00:00:26.750> all<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.080> way<00:00:27.170> up<00:00:27.260> to<00:00:27.410> eight<00:00:27.529> hundred

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
lumens all the way up to eight hundred

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.720 
lumens all the way up to eight hundred
and<00:00:28.010> sixty<00:00:29.619> incredibly<00:00:30.619> compact<00:00:31.189> for<00:00:31.520> how

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
and sixty incredibly compact for how

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.510 
and sixty incredibly compact for how
many<00:00:32.290> lumens<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:33.379> puts<00:00:33.620> out<00:00:33.800> it<00:00:34.190> puts<00:00:34.370> out

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
many lumens this puts out it puts out

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.420 
many lumens this puts out it puts out
ton<00:00:34.790> of<00:00:34.820> light<00:00:35.059> we're<00:00:36.050> actually<00:00:36.170> kind<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:36.800> on<00:00:37.370> a

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
ton of light we're actually kind of on a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.600 
ton of light we're actually kind of on a
dirt<00:00:37.730> road<00:00:37.760> here<00:00:38.239> with<00:00:38.420> some<00:00:38.840> trees<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.610> couple

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
dirt road here with some trees a couple

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.390 
dirt road here with some trees a couple
hundred<00:00:40.760> yards<00:00:41.150> back<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:41.980> I'll<00:00:42.980> go<00:00:43.129> ahead<00:00:43.220> and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
hundred yards back so I'll go ahead and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.950 
hundred yards back so I'll go ahead and
cycle<00:00:44.090> through<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.420> four<00:00:44.629> different

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
cycle through the four different

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.119 
cycle through the four different
settings<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.470> can<00:00:45.590> see<00:00:45.830> what<00:00:45.980> they<00:00:46.100> look

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
settings so you can see what they look

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.160 
settings so you can see what they look
like<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.120> again<00:00:47.570> nightcore<00:00:49.120> p25<00:00:50.120> from<00:00:50.930> two

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
like but again nightcore p25 from two

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.899 
like but again nightcore p25 from two
lumens<00:00:51.559> all<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.890> way<00:00:51.979> up<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.280> eight<00:00:52.550> hundred

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
lumens all the way up to eight hundred

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.579 
lumens all the way up to eight hundred
and<00:00:52.940> sixty<00:00:53.089> let's<00:00:54.019> check<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:54.320> out

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.090 

so<00:00:57.589> there's<00:00:57.769> our<00:00:57.890> two<00:00:57.949> lumens<00:00:59.739> there's<00:01:00.739> stage

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
so there's our two lumens there's stage

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.149 
so there's our two lumens there's stage
two<00:01:03.790> got<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:04.820> real<00:01:05.120> good<00:01:05.299> beam<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.930> very<00:01:06.920> good

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
two got a real good beam and very good

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.740 
two got a real good beam and very good
peripheral<00:01:09.430> stage<00:01:10.430> three<00:01:12.070> which<00:01:13.070> is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
peripheral stage three which is

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.030 
peripheral stage three which is
incredibly<00:01:14.750> bright<00:01:15.080> for<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.470> sized<00:01:15.710> light

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
incredibly bright for this sized light

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.380 
incredibly bright for this sized light
and<00:01:16.369> then<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.390> even<00:01:17.510> goes<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:18.290> stage<00:01:18.710> four

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
and then it even goes to a stage four

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.340 
and then it even goes to a stage four
which<00:01:20.390> i<00:01:20.540> think<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.140> absolutely

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
which i think is just absolutely

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.109 
which i think is just absolutely
incredible<00:01:22.070> for<00:01:22.789> this<00:01:22.939> size<00:01:24.549> really<00:01:25.549> compact

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
incredible for this size really compact

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.319 
incredible for this size really compact
light<00:01:26.469> really<00:01:27.469> lightweight<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.609> I'm<00:01:29.149> just

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
light really lightweight and I'm just

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.649 
light really lightweight and I'm just
absolutely<00:01:29.710> impressed<00:01:30.710> with<00:01:31.210> how<00:01:32.210> much<00:01:32.390> light

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
absolutely impressed with how much light

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.599 
absolutely impressed with how much light
this<00:01:32.899> little<00:01:33.140> guy<00:01:33.259> puts<00:01:33.530> out<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:34.039> mean<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.429> can

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
this little guy puts out I mean I can

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.270 
this little guy puts out I mean I can
see<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:35.030> can<00:01:35.509> see<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.899> ridge<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:37.130> know

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
see I can see a ridge that's you know

see I can see a ridge that's you know
six<00:01:37.609> hundred<00:01:37.909> yards<00:01:38.090> away<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.920> can<00:01:39.920> see<00:01:39.950> every

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
six hundred yards away I can see every

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.880 
six hundred yards away I can see every
detail<00:01:40.609> on<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.179> tree<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:41.719> is<00:01:41.869> about<00:01:42.109> 50

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
detail on that tree which is about 50

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.020 
detail on that tree which is about 50
yards<00:01:44.590> come<00:01:45.590> down<00:01:45.770> here<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.249> that<00:01:46.549> tree<00:01:46.850> it's

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
yards come down here to that tree it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.330 
yards come down here to that tree it's
about<00:01:47.179> a<00:01:47.240> hundred<00:01:47.539> yards<00:01:47.780> away<00:01:47.929> I<00:01:51.070> mean<00:01:52.070> this

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
about a hundred yards away I mean this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.700 
about a hundred yards away I mean this
is<00:01:52.549> just<00:01:52.579> incredible

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710
