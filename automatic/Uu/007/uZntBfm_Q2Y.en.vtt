00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.390
 Welcome everyone to the tethered me 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.309
 I am the magician and on this small occasion 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.889
 I bring you the video tutorial so that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.139
 can perform root to your device 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.599
 from android but before we start let's go 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.990
 with the presentation and we continue with the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.990
 video 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.430
 very good guys before you start with 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.170
 this video you have to know and know what 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.399
 is the root its benefits and its 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.720
 disadvantages 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.879
 All this you will find in the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.940
 description of the video there are some 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.830
 Chinese terminals a few devices or 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.379
 smartphone that come manufactured from makes 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.040
 that already come with the root installed alone 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.830
 that many times we do not know if it comes or 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.600
 not already rooted for this what we have 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.180
 what to do is simply download 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.550
 an application called root checker 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.229
 the link of this application is in the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.840
 description of the video is totally 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.320
 free and here we give you to verify 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 root once you verify it we will 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 say in this case that does not have root 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.149
 this phone in case you have it 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.610
 because we simply will not indicate 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.039
 same way and the application that we are going to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.690
 use is called air root the download of 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.729
 this application I am also going to 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.979
 leave the video description one 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.130
 once we have downloaded it installed 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.679
 we just open it and once it's open 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.110
 we simply connect the device 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.130
 mobile 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.540
 via usb by the cable ok then here 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.300
 is telling us what 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.220
 the application is being installed in 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.360
 our terminal us here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 we simply wait 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.320
 and here already tells us that the device has 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.730
 been connected and you do not have permissions 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.900
 of root ok 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.600
 in this case we mark this box and 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.740
 to do the root we simply give it 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.740
 here to the root button 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.780
 and ready the device has been 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.810
 rooted once this is done 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.490
 device is going to restart and already 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.230
 We will have our permits 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.990
 administrator to either delete 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.390
 applications that come with the system 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.400
 operative to be able to install some 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.580
 applications that we can not on the play 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.500
 store since we need to be root a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.900
 which I must emphasize to you is that in 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.150
 the case of wanting to root the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.940
 we can do it through 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.290
 this same application reversing the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.719
 step ok 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.519
 to confirm the root simply 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.519
 we unlock our device 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.240
 and here we go again to the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.060
 application that I had already mentioned 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.270
 and here we are going to verify the state of the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.270
 root 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.689
 we authorize and here as you can observe 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.269
 you already have the rut installed on 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.180
 device basically this program 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.159
 works with almost all devices 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.900
 remember that in this case this terminal 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 it has android 4.2 and the living and good the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.500
 root works in a normal way of good 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.260
 way so they should not have 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.790
 any kind of problem and good guys 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.939
 I hope you liked remember 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.040
 that if you liked give me your lay and without 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.139
 more than saying we are seeing ourselves in a 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.180
 next video but before I leave the 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.189
 social networks by which you 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.189
 You can contact me until soon
