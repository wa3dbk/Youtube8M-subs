00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 for 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.360
 alone are you poor mortals I am 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.730
 batman not actually it's not batman 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.080
 it's me I know it's easy to get 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.240
 let deceive by a suit of this 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.110
 quality I do not blame you for the 20th 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.360
 July 2012 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.160
 aurora in the colorado james giddens 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.539
 open fire during the preview of 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.380
 movie the dark knight rises of 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.090
 christopher nolan 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.980
 twelve people will die and 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.390
 fifty eight will be hurt this drama 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.920
 will have repercussions up to europe 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.449
 since the preview in paris will be 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 canceled and that many newspapers 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.239
 will not hesitate to say that it's because 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.100
 that the film is violent that it generates 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.269
 this kind of behavior unless 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.559
 you are convinced that the 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.180
 rock'n'roll and video games make 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.890
 the violent children you had to have you 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.180
 ask the same question as me how 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.430
 this film can be held responsible 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.840
 of such an abomination in a country where 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.760
 the weapons are on sale 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.649
 some for theory that the responsible 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.480
 of the massacre did not choose the film by 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.920
 chance indeed the parents of bruce 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.020
 wayne were murdered while he 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.100
 was coming out of the cinema however the origins 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.100
 of batman as they are told 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 in 1948 it is absolutely not said that 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 the wine family was coming out of the cinema but 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.890
 simply that she was walking in the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.960
 street 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.030
 moreover the assassin only fires one 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.229
 ball that kills thomas swain martha she 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.179
 have a heart attack 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.039
 shocked by the murder of her husband then 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.910
 beyond his big headlines I 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.740
 realized how much 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.390
 batman's story was sprinkled with 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.619
 sordid facts and I told myself 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.940
 that it was a lot more interesting to 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.770
 to talk to you about that rather than 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.300
 a beautiful birthday video for his 75 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.170
 years and also because I like 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.030
 the stuff a little sordid 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.289
 after the death of bruce wayne's parents 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.209
 comes the one from the dick family 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.399
 grayson of the circus artists the 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.110
 flying greyson murdered by the mafia 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.090
 who will try to make up the crime in one 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.319
 unfortunate attention trapeze accident 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.729
 there I speak to children whose 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.349
 parents are trapeze artist then the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.209
 kids do not have fun cutting the 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.170
 strings it will not make you a super 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.340
 hero one year one year 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.200
 besides, I do not know why but 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.729
 when i think about dick grayson i think 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.140
 automatically to the movie under the most 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.729
 big top of the world that you too 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380
 you are necessarily already typed with your 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.970
 grandparents at christmas on france 3 when 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.989
 you were a kid although they all 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.789
 the two lost their parents 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.739
 bruce and dick will not live at all 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.420
 the same way while bruce we will close 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.869
 in a forced solitude in search of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.940
 justice 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.349
 dick will remain open to others but will have 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.270
 much more likely to look for the 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.220
 revenge this is one of the two 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.620
 major difference between batman and robin 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.970
 the other is that Robin is in underwear but 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.500
 this is the proof that this batman is 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.330
 a dangerous patient who is would be a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.829
 child and fight crime in underwear 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.890
 these differences in behavior 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.230
 will push the dynamic 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.819
 duo to part with dick will continue his 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.470
 superhero career under the mask 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.450
 of nightwing bruce wayne will find a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.590
 new little buddy costumed in the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.350
 nobody from jason todd 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.790
 my god this sentence is weird the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.430
 second robin will end tragically 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.110
 in 1988 during the saga to a mourning in 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.940
 the family written by jean star line 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.100
 he will be savagely murdered with blows 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.570
 crowbars by the joker dc comics 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.220
 proposes to its readers to vote by 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.170
 phone to decide the fate of the poor 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.150
 Jason had more than 10,000 participants 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.900
 and his death was voted with a very 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.370
 slight majority 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.780
 actually the comics is a little bit 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.160
 like reality TV but with a 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.720
 intrigue intelligent characters and 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.220
 the complicated words two numbers of 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.940
 telephone were created one involving 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.470
 death of jason the other his survival 5343 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.440
 people voted for the death of the young 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.060
 hero and 5271 so he stays among 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.130
 we even say that a citizen 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.780
 american would have cheated programming his 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.660
 computer so he dials the number 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.040
 for the death of the character every 90 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.600
 seconds for eight hours in a row 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400
 offering him the bill of 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.019
 the saltiest phone of the 20th century 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.500
 in fact it was not the first time 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.120
 that robyn moore and in batman 156 in 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.470
 1963 our hero had already lost his 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.820
 young argue but all this 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.000
 was actually just a hallucination 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.709
 yes the 60s all of this you see the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.209
 table what jason todd comes back from between 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.560
 the dead under the redwood mask a 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.030
 direct reference to his murderer 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.799
 since this is actually the first 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.299
 identity of the joker as we can see 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.459
 in the killing joke it's always in 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.019
 1988 under the direction of alan moore and 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.220
 brian bolland that will be born this 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.810
 adventure that is among the most 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.370
 controversial black knight the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.900
 killing joke is primarily centered on 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.190
 the character of the joker and on the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.299
 very special relationship he 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.739
 maintains with batman 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.120
 they consider it indeed as a 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.900
 enemy but also as he has of 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.190
 closer to a friend 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.140
 we discover several scenes 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.760
 particularly shocking one of the most 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.799
 memorable is probably the one where joker 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.720
 burst in the gordon pulling at 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.340
 bout bearing on barbara the daughter of 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.989
 commissioner and ally of bachmann under the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.610
 batgirl mask following this 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 aggression she will lose use of her 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.850
 legs and take to the secret identity 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.590
 of oracle the joker will then lift the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.000
 commissioner gordon forcing this one 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.739
 watched pictures of his injured daughter 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.150
 and naked which suggests 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.190
 even worse things 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.840
 dc comics will also ask brian 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.190
 bolland to redraw some passages 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.720
 considered too explicit 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.400
 alan moore says he regrets 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.120
 to have nailed barbara gordon in a 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.740
 Wheelchair 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.539
 he was not tender with her in the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.979
 original script which will be worth it to be 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.040
 abused by several associations 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.750
 feminists 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.190
 the other issue raised by the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.690
 killing joke and probably the most 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.160
 great ever posed in the universe of 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.470
 batman at the end of the story 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.460
 batman kill the joker then of course 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.140
 if everyone will have his interpretation 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.910
 personal of the end totally 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.200
 Enigmatic of this story is that of 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.740
 many theories are circulating on 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.450
 Internet 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.100
 the simple idea that batman can put 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.280
 to death his sworn enemy moved more 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.780
 a 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.550
 indeed one of the main rules 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.140
 followed by the black knight and not 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.990
 not to kill criminals and to 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.500
 refuse any form of gratuitous violence 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.910
 finally normally 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.680
 moreover if it is now known to 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.330
 all that batman refuses to use 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.280
 firearms it was absolutely not the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.990
 case in its early days bob kane and bill finger 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.640
 inspired by many characters 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.110
 of pulse like this shadow that had 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.180
 no remorse to use weapons 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.230
 lethal very quickly and following 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.820
 many pressures from 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.350
 of parents' associations fighting against 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.300
 violence in batman comics 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.130
 will drop his weapon in favor of 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.270
 various batman gadgets is part of these 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.980
 borderline characters 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.510
 we expect him to be a vigilante 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.370
 flawless observing a code of 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.360
 strict driving but we also know to 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.860
 how much he has to show 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.480
 coolness in the face of an opponent does that 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.440
 the joker especially after all he has 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.970
 hurts his loved ones 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.710
 that's a bit of why each of us 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.760
 we can recognize ourselves as batman by 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.500
 example when an old lady 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.000
 crossed the street the sleeping hero 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.920
 in us pushes us to help him 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.360
 but on the other hand we all have a crazy 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.400
 want to push under this big truck 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.320
 that comes at full speed from a game 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.130
 I'm the only one who does it 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.510
 nobody even more recently bruce 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.250
 wayne had to deal with the death of his 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.140
 own damian son who had endorsed to 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.430
 turn robin's suit as well as 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.020
 the kidnapping of all his allies by the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.850
 joker who made them believe then of a 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.480
 sadistic game that had snatched them the 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.070
 facial skin 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.210
 so I told you a lot about the joker 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.710
 but if batman is one of the best 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.000
 superhero it's also because he 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.990
 has one of the best gallery of 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.520
 bad guys that can be found in 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.780
 the comics and that many of them 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.490
 owe their existence to different 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.840
 forms of violence indeed if harvey 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.370
 dance has become double-faced it's because 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.600
 that he was disfigured by acid 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.310
 we can imagine the violence 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.110
 psychological that had to undergo oswald 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.670
 cobblepot because of his physical front 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.590
 to become the penguin or the 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.270
 suffering felt by mr freeze face 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.710
 to his inability to save the one he 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.270
 like to ask yourself a moment the question 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.310
 deep inside you feel more 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.570
