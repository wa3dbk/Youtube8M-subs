00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
doesn't love him and so he's going to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.479 
doesn't love him and so he's going to
give<00:02:11.959> back<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.410> kids<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.920> take<00:02:13.340> his

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
I love the details of the film the only

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.360 
I love the details of the film the only
problem<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.110> pacing<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.160> also

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
problem is is the pacing and I also

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.190 
problem is is the pacing and I also
think<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.090> there<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.660> too<00:02:26.989> much

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
think that there is like too much

think that there is like too much
padding<00:02:27.620> involved<00:02:28.370> even<00:02:29.120> though<00:02:29.269> Brandon

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
padding involved even though Brandon

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.570

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
sustains the film with his really wacky

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.280 
sustains the film with his really wacky
performance<00:02:32.239> there's<00:02:32.659> too<00:02:32.840> much<00:02:33.019> free<00:02:33.260> time

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
performance there's too much free time

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.110 
performance there's too much free time
going<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.310> should<00:02:34.519> just<00:02:34.670> be<00:02:34.790> tighter

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
going on and it should just be tighter

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.390 
going on and it should just be tighter
yeah<00:02:35.750> no<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.230> definitely<00:02:36.950> agree<00:02:37.010> with<00:02:37.159> that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
yeah no I I definitely agree with that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.890 
yeah no I I definitely agree with that
yeah<00:02:37.519> I<00:02:37.580> think<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:38.239> like<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.510> movie<00:02:38.780> more

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
yeah I think you like this movie more

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.470 
yeah I think you like this movie more
than<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.140> do<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.790> no<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.819> think<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.239> biggest

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
than I do but no I think the biggest

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.300 
than I do but no I think the biggest
problem<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.500> takes<00:02:42.739> like<00:02:42.920> half<00:02:43.129> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
problem is that it takes like half the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.890 
problem is that it takes like half the
film<00:02:43.489> for<00:02:43.730> anything<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.180> really<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.870> really

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
film for anything to really to really

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.589 
film for anything to really to really
happen<00:02:45.739> even<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.400> inciting<00:02:46.760> incident<00:02:47.060> is

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
happen even the inciting incident is

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.500 
happen even the inciting incident is
just<00:02:47.870> watching<00:02:48.140> dad<00:02:48.530> fuck<00:02:48.980> mom<00:02:49.280> which<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.360> not

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
just watching dad fuck mom which and not

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.300 
just watching dad fuck mom which and not
even<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.379> bad<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:51.950> pretty<00:02:52.069> it's

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
even that that bad it's pretty it's

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.000 
even that that bad it's pretty it's
pretty<00:02:52.370> tame<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.150> looks<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> butter
