back so what I did was I clip back the
hair<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.979> wasn't<00:02:05.219> gonna<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
hair that I wasn't gonna have out in the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.160 
hair that I wasn't gonna have out in the
back<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.060> separated<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.539> part<00:02:09.960> right

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
back then I separated this part right

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.050 
back then I separated this part right
here<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.190> wig<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.880> lay<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
here for the wig so I'm going to lay it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.330 
here for the wig so I'm going to lay it
over<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> wig<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.830> makes<00:02:14.040> any<00:02:14.250> sense

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
over the wig and that makes any sense

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.530 
over the wig and that makes any sense
and<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> left<00:02:14.970> these<00:02:15.180> edges<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.080> right<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:17.540> so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
and I left these edges out right here so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.880 
and I left these edges out right here so
I<00:02:18.570> take<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:20.780> flip<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.960> forward<00:02:22.320> make

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
I take it like this flip it forward make

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.570 
I take it like this flip it forward make
sure<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.220> part<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.910> right

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
sure that part is right

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.350 
sure that part is right
at<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.120> base<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.760> where<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.090> part

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
at the base like this is where the part

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.840 
at the base like this is where the part
ends<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.890> want<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.160> make<00:02:31.340> sure<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.700> as

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
ends and I want to make sure it's as

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.570 
ends and I want to make sure it's as
close<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.570> hair<00:02:32.900> as<00:02:33.050> possible<00:02:33.490> then<00:02:34.490> I'm

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
and combed the out of this and it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.589 
and combed the out of this and it
still<00:04:16.169> retain<00:04:16.650> its<00:04:16.859> curl<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.329> pro

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
still retain its curl so that is a pro

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.569 
still retain its curl so that is a pro
so<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.959> pro<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:20.099> beautiful
