00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
these stands you walk up and then you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.500 
these stands you walk up and then you

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
like a walkway through a vault to go

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.670 
like a walkway through a vault to go
through<00:04:07.970> all<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.299> box<00:04:08.510> offices<00:04:08.959> if<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.560> look

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
through all the box offices if you look

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.830 
through all the box offices if you look
up<00:04:09.830> actually<00:04:10.280> at<00:04:10.370> these<00:04:10.519> top<00:04:10.880> of<00:04:11.030> box<00:04:11.269> offices

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
up actually at these top of box offices

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.390 
up actually at these top of box offices
I<00:04:11.959> decorated<00:04:12.380> them<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.160> light<00:04:13.370> can

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
I decorated them so that the light can

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.060 
I decorated them so that the light can
actually<00:04:14.239> penetrate<00:04:14.930> through<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.709> as<00:04:15.950> you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
actually penetrate through and as you

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.920 
actually penetrate through and as you
can<00:04:16.190> see<00:04:16.250> there's<00:04:16.489> like<00:04:16.609> smoke<00:04:16.760> stacks<00:04:17.239> with

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
can see there's like smoke stacks with

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.500 
can see there's like smoke stacks with
smoke<00:04:18.229> coming<00:04:18.260> out<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:19.850> course<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.330> have

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
smoke coming out and of course you have

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.440 
smoke coming out and of course you have
to<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.840> these<00:04:21.229> I<00:04:21.940> don't<00:04:22.940> remember<00:04:23.240> what

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
to have these I don't remember what

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.810 
to have these I don't remember what
these<00:04:23.540> calder<00:04:23.960> but<00:04:24.080> they're<00:04:24.290> like<00:04:24.470> the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
these calder but they're like the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.490 
these calder but they're like the
balance<00:04:25.820> there's<00:04:26.330> like<00:04:26.450> we<00:04:26.630> hit<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.900> homerun

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
balance there's like we hit a homerun

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.560 
balance there's like we hit a homerun
you<00:04:28.250> know<00:04:28.400> if<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.640> balls<00:04:28.850> on<00:04:28.970> this<00:04:29.030> side<00:04:29.300> then

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
you know if the balls on this side then

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.080 
you know if the balls on this side then
you<00:04:29.600> I'm<00:04:30.140> sound<00:04:30.620> home<00:04:30.770> run<00:04:30.979> and<00:04:31.340> it's<00:04:31.580> Bell<00:04:31.790> or

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
you I'm sound home run and it's Bell or

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.270 
you I'm sound home run and it's Bell or
if<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.360> on<00:04:32.479> this<00:04:32.600> side<00:04:32.740> then<00:04:33.740> it's<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.100> home

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
if it's on this side then it's a home

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.950 
if it's on this side then it's a home
run

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
run

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.870 
run
as<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.110> can<00:04:36.200> see<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.890> grass<00:04:37.130> looks<00:04:37.460> like<00:04:37.669> it's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
as you can see the grass looks like it's

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.730 
as you can see the grass looks like it's
been<00:04:38.150> cut<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:39.020> took<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.560> long<00:04:39.710> time

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
been cut that took a long time

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.220 
been cut that took a long time
I<00:04:40.770> would<00:04:41.040> estimate<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.910> build<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:42.930> over

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
I would estimate this build to have over

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.750 
I would estimate this build to have over
a<00:04:43.260> million<00:04:43.560> box<00:04:43.950> at<00:04:44.280> least<00:04:44.840> I'm<00:04:45.840> probably

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
a million box at least I'm probably

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.800 
a million box at least I'm probably
cloak<00:04:47.760> yeah<00:04:48.090> it's<00:04:48.270> definitely<00:04:48.480> over<00:04:48.780> a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
cloak yeah it's definitely over a

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.100 
cloak yeah it's definitely over a
million<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.040> don't<00:04:50.220> know<00:04:50.340> how<00:04:50.760> many<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:51.630> is

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
million but I don't know how many it is

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.700 
million but I don't know how many it is
for<00:04:52.620> exact<00:04:53.010> measure<00:04:53.430> but<00:04:53.900> it's<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:55.110> lot<00:04:55.290> just

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
for exact measure but it's a lot just

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.630 
for exact measure but it's a lot just
take<00:04:56.220> my<00:04:56.340> word<00:04:56.490> for<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:56.940> then<00:04:57.590> it's

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
take my word for it and then it's

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.490 
take my word for it and then it's
basically<00:04:59.640> the<00:05:00.240> biggest<00:05:00.480> build<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.080> have<00:05:01.320> ever

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
basically the biggest build I have ever

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.320 
basically the biggest build I have ever
done<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.100> it's<00:05:02.400> actually<00:05:02.760> my<00:05:02.910> favorite<00:05:03.030> as

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
done and it's actually my favorite as

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.230 
done and it's actually my favorite as
