00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you can use the text animation in After

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
you can use the text animation in After
Effects<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.289> create<00:00:19.679> a<00:00:19.859> tapping<00:00:20.490> effect<00:00:20.849> so

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
Effects to create a tapping effect so

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.480 
Effects to create a tapping effect so
first<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.900> all<00:00:22.019> let's<00:00:22.230> take<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.679> look<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.070> what

we<00:00:23.640> are<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> create<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.679> can

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we are going to create so here you can

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.050 
we are going to create so here you can
see<00:00:28.919> I<00:00:30.169> have<00:00:31.169> a<00:00:31.410> paragraph<00:00:31.980> where<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.820> each

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
see I have a paragraph where the each

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.150 
see I have a paragraph where the each
and<00:00:33.360> every<00:00:33.720> character<00:00:33.900> is<00:00:34.350> revealing<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:34.980> by

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and every character is revealing one by

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.460 
and every character is revealing one by
one<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.480> looks<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.050> someone<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
one and it looks like someone is

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.760 
one and it looks like someone is
actually<00:00:37.830> tapping<00:00:38.310> it<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.730> real<00:00:39.000> time<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.770> how

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
actually tapping it in real time so how

actually tapping it in real time so how
to<00:00:40.830> create<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.280> effect<00:00:41.450> here<00:00:42.450> i<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
to create this effect here i have a

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.950 
to create this effect here i have a
composition<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.280> i<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> text<00:00:45.240> layer<00:00:45.420> with

value from 100 to zero percent as you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.250 
value from 100 to zero percent as you
can<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:24.120> I<00:01:24.150> degree<00:01:24.600> increase<00:01:25.020> or

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
can see when I degree increase or

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.680 
can see when I degree increase or
decrease<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.650> add<00:01:25.920> value<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.540> our

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
decrease the add value we can see our

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.170 
decrease the add value we can see our
text<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.230> animating<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.640> will<00:01:29.760> use<00:01:29.970> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
text is animating so we will use this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.320 
text is animating so we will use this
and<00:01:30.479> value<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.800> create<00:01:32.159> an<00:01:32.310> animation<00:01:32.729> by

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
and value to create an animation by

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.670 
and value to create an animation by
creating<00:01:33.900> keyframes<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.520> let's<00:01:36.380> take<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> down

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
creating keyframes so let's take it down

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.040 
creating keyframes so let's take it down
all<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.010> way<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> 0<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:39.780> I'll<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.010> at<00:01:41.370> the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
all the way to 0 now I'll go here at the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.680 
all the way to 0 now I'll go here at the
first<00:01:43.050> frame<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.860> timeline<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.420> click

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
first frame of my timeline and I click

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.600 
first frame of my timeline and I click
here<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.229> stopwatch<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.190> will<00:01:47.370> add<00:01:47.580> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
here on the stopwatch and it will add a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.960 
here on the stopwatch and it will add a
keyframe<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:49.110> I'll<00:01:50.070> move<00:01:50.340> few<00:01:50.700> frames

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
keyframe you then I'll move few frames

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.130 
keyframe you then I'll move few frames
forward<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.850> increase<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
forward and now I will increase the and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.520 
forward and now I will increase the and
value<00:01:55.530> from<00:01:55.740> 0<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.370> 100<00:01:56.549> percent<00:01:57.260> now<00:01:58.260> let's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
value from 0 to 100 percent now let's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.719 
value from 0 to 100 percent now let's
time<00:01:58.860> preview<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> check<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.540> got

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
time preview and check what we have got

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.250 
time preview and check what we have got
okay<00:02:02.729> now<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.750> pretty<00:02:04.049> decent

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
okay now we have got a pretty decent

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.539 
okay now we have got a pretty decent
animation<00:02:05.100> here<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:07.340> compare<00:02:08.340> this

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
animation here but if you compare this

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.940 
animation here but if you compare this
to<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> real-world<00:02:09.179> situation<00:02:09.569> where<00:02:10.529> you<00:02:10.799> are

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
to a real-world situation where you are

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470 
to a real-world situation where you are
actually<00:02:11.099> using<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.760> keyboard<00:02:11.939> to<00:02:12.269> type

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
actually using your keyboard to type

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.500 
actually using your keyboard to type
something<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
something you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.740 
something you
notice<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.319> there<00:02:15.250> are<00:02:15.310> time<00:02:16.180> delays<00:02:16.540> or

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
notice that there are time delays or

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.289 
notice that there are time delays or
time<00:02:17.049> gaps<00:02:17.319> between<00:02:17.530> every<00:02:18.280> word<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.090> your

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
time gaps between every word of your

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.990 
time gaps between every word of your
sentence<00:02:19.659> so<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.319> create<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:21.010> same<00:02:21.370> time<00:02:21.700> gap

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
sentence so to create it same time gap

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.110 
sentence so to create it same time gap
here<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.769> go<00:02:24.069> into<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.640> advanced

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
