00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.140
 something happens in my chemistry 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.519
 body is dark moments 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.050
 something completely on my body 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.980
 is written 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.980
 however, I am nocturnal 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 good evening 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.990
 very nice not to forget to check out 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.850
 the home 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.849
 at the moment a uniform got it through 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.800
 that train is running then I am at the theater 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.330
 I am just like that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.570
 the performance three hundredth time 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.020
 and that also with enormous enthusiasm 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 keeps doing 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.379
 you can do it in two ways when you can 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.199
 keeping it strictly business by ticket 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.930
 to cut or scan a card but 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.610
 I am someone who finds extra laces 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.690
 it is very nice to be with travelers 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.830
 to communicate 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.960
 and I always try my own 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.070
 cheerfulness are the cheerfulness too 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.239
 bring train 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.400
 it happens that people why it's the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.690
 get off the train and say conductor found 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 so cozy with you 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.420
 and the only thing i do is on one 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 enthusiastic and manner doing my job 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.090
 it's exactly what I always called color 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.400
 from the night train 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.619
 with the enormous varied work of traveling 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.150
 tranquility that fascinates me enormously 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.939
 I think I always find it beautiful 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.439
 to do people on their way to work 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.600
 commuting tourists from one 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.710
 destination returning to the other 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.240
 offer someone with in the winter 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.900
 flip flops in shorts while 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.540
 Outside 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.090
 minus 8 is what I call people who like 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.039
 the big parties come to party is great 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.920
 have a concert in train full of 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.049
 boas and that variety of 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.240
 travelers who makes the night train whole 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.439
 irritating 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.719
 I'm really a man for the late 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.210
 services and as the day progresses 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.679
 I start my rhythm as well 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.369
 to come all the way i am really one 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.700
 evening person 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.229
 I rarely have night shift and dip 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.600
 summer the night with cities becoming an old one 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.729
 man with the hammer or i'm tired of praising 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.229
 i draw that i don't have i'm cart and 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.479
 I think that awake in the Netherlands 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.159
 few conductors are those 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.140
 amount of night shifts 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.609
 I have turned it 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.859
 is another rhythm you will have to 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.380
 I have a different type of traveler 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.119
 and you should really make sense if you 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.270
 completely your thing then you have one 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.330
 insanely nice night and emotional 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.100
 go in my mind very quickly you 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.510
 starts at 10:00 before d know it 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.620
 daylight 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.140
 I find the day wear and slow and boring 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.360
 i think the night has something ep collins 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220
 I am or in a past life I am one 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.819
 been mole or you with a bat 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.819
 been
