have<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.640> checks<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> place<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> guess

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
have these checks in place so I guess

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
have these checks in place so I guess
you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> need<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.210> your

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you know you need to really do your

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.429 
you know you need to really do your
research<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.869> need<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> maybe<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
research you need to maybe have a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.340 
research you need to maybe have a
department<00:01:53.040> within<00:01:53.270> these<00:01:54.270> big<00:01:54.570> retailers<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
department within these big retailers to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
department within these big retailers to
understand<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.909> saying<00:01:57.180> how<00:01:57.270> do

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
understand how do we do so saying how do

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
understand how do we do so saying how do
we<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.659> responsible<00:01:58.290> sourcing<00:01:58.439> maybe<00:01:59.189> they

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
we do responsible sourcing maybe they

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.740 
we do responsible sourcing maybe they
have<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.850> checks<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> place

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
have to be more checks in place

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.010 
have to be more checks in place
maybe<00:02:01.500> somebody<00:02:01.950> physically<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:02.520> let's<00:02:02.729> say

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
maybe somebody physically from let's say

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.940 
maybe somebody physically from let's say
hmm<00:02:04.020> needs<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> those

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
hmm needs to actually go to those

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.380 
hmm needs to actually go to those
factories<00:02:05.430> where<00:02:05.579> they<00:02:05.610> signed<00:02:05.909> them<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
factories where they signed them up and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.730 
factories where they signed them up and
see<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> health<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.649> safety

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
see what are the health and safety

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
see what are the health and safety
regulations<00:02:08.399> harder<00:02:08.849> than<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> factory<00:02:09.539> our

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
regulations harder than a factory our

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.839 
regulations harder than a factory our
workers<00:02:10.080> mean<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.739> any<00:02:11.129> child<00:02:11.400> labour<00:02:11.730> in

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
workers mean it is any child labour in

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.500 
workers mean it is any child labour in
the<00:02:11.910> world<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:12.660> even<00:02:12.810> get<00:02:13.020> time

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the world do they even get time

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
the world do they even get time
to<00:02:13.569> eat<00:02:13.780> what<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.709> know<00:02:14.830> what<00:02:14.860> are<00:02:15.129> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
to eat what are you know what are the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.699 
to eat what are you know what are the
basic<00:02:15.849> are<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.629> basic<00:02:16.989> rights<00:02:17.379> being

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
basic are the basic rights being

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.440 
basic are the basic rights being
recognized<00:02:18.159> so<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> think<00:02:18.879> this<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.269> something

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
recognized so I think this is something

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
recognized so I think this is something
that<00:02:19.599> every<00:02:20.170> big<00:02:20.379> retailer<00:02:20.739> can<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.670> if

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
that every big retailer can do but if

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.280 
that every big retailer can do but if
you<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.329> spend<00:02:22.569> more<00:02:22.689> money<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:22.959> time<00:02:23.260> I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
you have to spend more money on time I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.619 
you have to spend more money on time I

the people working in these factories
good<00:02:34.329> I<00:02:34.390> would<00:02:34.510> imagine<00:02:34.659> that<00:02:35.049> among<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.860> six

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
good I would imagine that among the six

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.890 
good I would imagine that among the six
kids<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.400> feed<00:02:36.670> would<00:02:37.150> rather<00:02:37.329> that<00:02:37.569> she<00:02:37.720> had<00:02:37.870> a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
kids to feed would rather that she had a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.080 
kids to feed would rather that she had a
job<00:02:38.140> paying<00:02:38.500> very<00:02:38.709> little<00:02:38.980> money<00:02:39.099> than<00:02:39.760> having

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
job paying very little money than having

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.289 
job paying very little money than having
no<00:02:40.239> job<00:02:40.269> at<00:02:40.599> all<00:02:40.769> um<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.400> very<00:02:42.670> honest<00:02:43.060> I

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
no job at all um to be very honest I

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.170 
no job at all um to be very honest I
look<00:02:44.170> at<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.470> different<00:02:44.500> way<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.129> think<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
look at in a different way I think that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.119 
look at in a different way I think that
you<00:02:46.629> just<00:02:46.780> can't<00:02:47.049> employ<00:02:47.290> people<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.980> just

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
you just can't employ people and just

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.800 
you just can't employ people and just
say<00:02:48.220> they're<00:02:48.430> poor<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.000> know<00:02:49.269> they<00:02:49.659> need<00:02:49.780> a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
say they're poor so you know they need a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.030 
say they're poor so you know they need a
job<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.349> can<00:02:50.530> cause<00:02:50.650> some<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.890> their

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
job and that can cause some of their

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.470 
job and that can cause some of their
life<00:02:51.159> I<00:02:51.280> think<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:51.819> not<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> really<00:02:52.269> fair

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
life I think that's not a really fair

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.599 
life I think that's not a really fair
way<00:02:52.629> of<00:02:52.750> looking<00:02:53.079> at<00:02:53.200> art<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.069> think<00:02:54.519> these

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
way of looking at art it I think these

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.069 
way of looking at art it I think these
sort<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.879> measures<00:02:55.209> are<00:02:55.389> really<00:02:55.629> important

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
sort of measures are really important

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.140 
sort of measures are really important
and<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.620> might<00:02:56.829> hurt<00:02:57.280> them<00:02:57.519> in<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.760> short<00:02:57.970> term

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and it might hurt them in the short term

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.740 
and it might hurt them in the short term
in<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.569> short<00:02:58.780> time<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.560> if<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.799> look<00:02:59.980> at

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
in the short time but if you look at

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.360 
in the short time but if you look at
Bangladesh<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.959> second<00:03:02.349> largest<00:03:02.620> garment

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
Bangladesh is a second largest garment

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.910 
Bangladesh is a second largest garment
exporter<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.349> manufacturers<00:03:05.349> they<00:03:05.470> rely

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
exporter the manufacturers they rely

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920 
exporter the manufacturers they rely
heavily<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.549> industry<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.299> with<00:03:07.780> this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
heavily on that industry so with this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.449 
heavily on that industry so with this
sort<00:03:08.139> of<00:03:08.200> thing<00:03:08.260> which<00:03:08.650> has<00:03:08.799> happened<00:03:08.829> today

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
sort of thing which has happened today

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.490 
sort of thing which has happened today
maybe<00:03:09.730> EU<00:03:10.120> that's<00:03:10.810> also<00:03:11.109> going<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.319> really

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
maybe EU that's also going to really

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.280 
maybe EU that's also going to really
affect<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.280> manufacturer<00:03:12.909> so<00:03:13.540> maybe<00:03:14.079> in<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
affect the manufacturer so maybe in the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.319 
affect the manufacturer so maybe in the
short<00:03:14.470> period<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.799> time<00:03:14.889> it<00:03:15.190> might<00:03:15.370> affect<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
short period of time it might affect the

important<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.450> think<00:04:37.480> obviously<00:04:38.140> what<00:04:38.350> we

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
important and I think obviously what we

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.950 
important and I think obviously what we
you<00:04:39.070> know<00:04:39.190> your<00:04:39.940> home<00:04:40.210> upbringing<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.780> think

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
you know your home upbringing I think

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.180 
you know your home upbringing I think
all<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.140> these<00:04:41.320> are<00:04:41.500> really<00:04:41.620> important<00:04:42.100> and

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
all of these are really important and

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.740 
all of these are really important and
making<00:04:42.490> sure<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.270> become<00:04:43.540> conscious

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
making sure that you become conscious

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.800 
making sure that you become conscious
consumers<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.710> think<00:04:44.890> if<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.100> demand<00:04:45.280> less

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
consumers and I think if you demand less

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.440 
consumers and I think if you demand less
obviously<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:47.800> know<00:04:47.920> in<00:04:48.100> just<00:04:48.450> suppliers

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
obviously you know in just suppliers

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.990 
obviously you know in just suppliers
like<00:04:49.870> H&amp;M<00:04:50.260> or<00:04:50.680> prime<00:04:51.130> work<00:04:51.310> wouldn't<00:04:51.820> probably

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
like H&amp;M or prime work wouldn't probably

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.420 
like H&amp;M or prime work wouldn't probably
be<00:04:52.180> putting<00:04:52.420> that<00:04:52.630> much<00:04:52.810> pressure<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:53.430> getting

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
be putting that much pressure on getting

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.040 
be putting that much pressure on getting
those<00:04:54.580> prices<00:04:54.880> one<00:04:55.270> probably<00:04:55.540> putting<00:04:55.900> that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
those prices one probably putting that

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.660 
those prices one probably putting that
much<00:04:56.200> pressure<00:04:56.230> to<00:04:56.650> create<00:04:56.920> stuff<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.280> quickly

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
much pressure to create stuff so quickly

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.240 
much pressure to create stuff so quickly
so<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.210> think<00:04:58.300> as<00:04:58.510> consumers<00:04:59.110> it's<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.830> we

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
so I think as consumers it's a really we

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.010 
so I think as consumers it's a really we
need<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.400> really<00:05:00.670> look<00:05:00.820> at<00:05:00.940> ourselves<00:05:01.060> okay

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
need to really look at ourselves okay

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.210 
need to really look at ourselves okay
