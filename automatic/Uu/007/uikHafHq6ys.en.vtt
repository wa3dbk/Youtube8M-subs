00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello hello friends welcome 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.760
 again to a new place 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 presentation here kw cobox 8000 from the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.849
 Dutch company kw co 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.430
 and the whole thing is murdered here by 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 Czech modding team of this medium 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.160
 by angelus and yes friends again in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 a considerable achievement would mean mine 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.380
 we'll look in and see 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.619
 look around here 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 what's in here so friends 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.750
 Attention then it starts already over 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.700
 My idea about the Romans 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.219
 silo that's very important to us first 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.309
 have here before something else 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.420
 It may look pretty cool 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 we are looking but we have here first 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 here the possibility have ever the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.199
 Possibility is the road yet 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.920
 true kaeser forward the loading flap on 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.030
 and to do 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 I have to confess is already right 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.479
 visually perfect from that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.610
 Looks very good that endangers altogether 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.250
 good the possibility 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.409
 otherwise we have relatively little here 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.640
 functions but not negative 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 Please be friends, that's nothing 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.140
 Negative few functions do not mean 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 that murder is bad what sets us off 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.450
 but visually I look successful 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.850
 from hamm last kw already comes from 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 Czech team and it is now one 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.909
 further and with that one can 33 liters 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 load and how 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.619
 try again what normal to load 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.020
 if that's possible 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.689
 Of course, by filling states exactly 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 how perfect we are to see him 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.369
 rhine here in the shop and there you can 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.909
 recognize as we just 33,000 liters 65 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.319
 1530 is the price and we have here 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.420
 stood fruits and wood chips 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.299
 that fits in any case ever 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.230
 again over it mega stark big 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.640
 trailer but optically really cool succeeded 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.299
 Lighting is natural and boring 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.459
 There is no fault in the locomotive 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.730
 knows never wrong is faultless in 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.000
 the lok testifies to the fact that it works beautifully and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.640
 it is very very good so 33,000 liters 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.739
 loaded and we notice it here but 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.170
 though must admit times the steering axle 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.890
 deposited second directs with it is there 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.569
 Roughly estimated really great from the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.489

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.079

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.450
