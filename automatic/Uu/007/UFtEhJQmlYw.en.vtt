 weight loss diet also called 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.260
 ketogenic is a restrictive diet of 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.570
 very present that the ideal is to have the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.400
 medical consent before performing 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.470
 this or any other diet 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.790
 what is the ketogenic diet 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.550
 to lose weight 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.310
 as its name indicates the diet 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 ketogenic is based on causing a state 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.400
 of that ptosis in your body 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.750
 the formation of ketone bodies or 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.430
 Ketosis can be produced by fasting 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 prolonged a hypocaloric diet with 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.110
 insufficient power supply one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.440
 diet rich in proteins and fats but 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.690
 very restricted in carbohydrates when 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.270
 we talk about ketogenic diet for 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.539
 weight loss is referred to in general 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 to a type of diet in which they predominate 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.220
 proteins and fats at the expense of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.909
 an important restriction of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.700
 carbohydrates in such diets the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.039
 carbohydrates that you consume should not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.360
 exceed a maximum limit of 50 grams 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:55.710
 daily or a percentage of 5 to 10 per 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.540
 percent of the total calories ingested 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.900
 because it is effective to the ketogenic diet 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.850
 to lose weight 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.460
 the restriction on the consumption of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.100
 carbohydrates energy source by 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.650
 resort to fatty deposits for 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.890
 get power 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.400
 in such a way it allows you to lose more weight 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.700
 quickly even without you limiting the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.520
 contribution of calories 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.950
 what are the risks of the diets 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.010
 ketogenic 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.700
 they are very unbalanced in nutrients 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.160
 for this reason the ketogenic diets are 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.400
 they must be done for more than a month 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.860
