 which we have done with the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.100

 mostacilla 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.200
 now we go 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:15.460
 to put around here the form 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.370
 triangular as follows 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.630
 to make a ball here 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.630
 to our nylon 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.120
 once done this point to the thread two 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.730
 meters from mylo a number six we place 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:40.800
 the needle and we put it here 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.800
 until you get to the other green 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.730
 there we put three blue and metemos 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.050
 again for the green until you get 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.050
 to the other green 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.970
 this part we are going to put 3 to the sublime 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.060
 plus 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.060
 three blue and we put in the green 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.230
 until arriving 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.230
 the other time day 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.319
 you have blue 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.670
 and go through the green 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.879
 and we come to the other green 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.040
 to finish and give it a finish we put 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.959
 3 blue 4 dollars 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.959
 we passed the needle with the thread 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:52.879
 and here we get these three of quimilÃ­ 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.879
 and we go back for the golden 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:06.069
 and here we put three blue again 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.209
 and we go through the green and go down 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.209
 to the other time 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.820
 this point is as follows 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.400
 here we continue placing three is 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.400
 join 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.960
 we pay one green and we go to the other 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.220
 green 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.220
 what is going down 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:41.880
 again another 13 blue iris 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:45.840
 three blue and we went through the green 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.840
 we came back to the other time I saw 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.840
 going down 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.210
 and we will also get to the part of the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.380
 center 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:03.060
 where we put three blue no more 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.180
 and we just went through a green 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.180
 for once d 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.180
 we put three blue here 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.770
 we have to take on four doubts 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.730
 look here in this part of the center 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.260
 heritage are the four golden 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.260
 we go here 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.799
 we get this fate led by a 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.799
 golden 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.060
 ah 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.060
 and here we put 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.669
 3 in upload again 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.220
 and we went through only one green 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.840
 for once 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:02.210
 and we are staying in this way 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.670
 now we already have a triangle 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.920
 full 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:13.060
 let's do the same operation in the 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.060
 other triangles 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.900
 how can we realize we have already 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.680
 four triangles made we are 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:28.650
 here in the center we place three 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:33.770
 blue beads we are going up here 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.770
 we have three blue chairs going up 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.130
 and we will get to the middle 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.520
 we got here in the middle 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:57.310
 and in this part we are going to make a final 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.310
 since here we arrive here 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.930
 so not ready 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.930
 here 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.620
 click here 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.139
 and we finish here 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.610
 and we get up there 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.610
 we cut and burn 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:42.090
 up here measured the first half 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.100
 this half is another one we are going to make of 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.520
 the same way 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.950
 the two halves here in the center 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.660
 we're going to make another fabric but that's what 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.410
 we do when we are going to finish 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.410
 our necklace
