as you can see my foundation and my

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.830 
as you can see my foundation and my
brows<00:00:34.890> are<00:00:35.250> already<00:00:35.610> complete<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.360> check<00:00:36.750> out

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
brows are already complete so check out

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.229 
brows are already complete so check out
my<00:00:36.990> previous<00:00:37.380> episode<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.250> how<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.790> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
my previous episode to see how I do that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.270 
my previous episode to see how I do that
so<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> first<00:00:40.020> step<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.530> achieving<00:00:41.010> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so the first step in to achieving this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.020 
so the first step in to achieving this
cut<00:00:41.550> crease<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.060> to<00:00:42.750> apply<00:00:43.080> primer<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.640> here

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
cut crease is to apply primer so here

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.960 
cut crease is to apply primer so here

the color of my eye shadow so now that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.999 
the color of my eye shadow so now that
my<00:01:08.700> primary<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.479> means<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.410> area<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
my primary is on means this area is

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.440 
my primary is on means this area is
actually<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.430> sticky<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> best

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
actually really sticky so it's the best

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
actually really sticky so it's the best
time<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> deposit<00:01:12.990> any<00:01:13.290> color<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.190> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
time to deposit any color that I want to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
time to deposit any color that I want to

makeup<00:01:19.860> forever<00:01:20.160> I<00:01:20.460> find<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> easy<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.450> me<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
makeup forever I find it easy for me to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
makeup forever I find it easy for me to
use<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.930> angle<00:01:22.380> brush<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.130> thin<00:01:23.369> 12

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
use this angle brush a really thin 12

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.050 
use this angle brush a really thin 12
carbon<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.960> order<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.440> find<00:01:25.740> where<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.880> need

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
carbon in order to find where you need

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
carbon in order to find where you need
to<00:01:27.210> carve<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:28.020> look<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.470> notice<00:01:28.890> where

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to carve so if you look and notice where

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.279 
to carve so if you look and notice where
my<00:01:29.190> eyelid<00:01:29.580> crease<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.750> here

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
my eyelid crease is it's actually here

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.080 
my eyelid crease is it's actually here
I'm<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> exaggerate<00:01:32.160> just<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.759> little

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I'm going to exaggerate just a little

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.770 
I'm going to exaggerate just a little
bit<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:34.289> up<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.619> few<00:01:35.040> millimeters<00:01:35.780> it's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
bit and go up a few millimeters it's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170 
bit and go up a few millimeters it's
quite<00:01:36.990> obvious<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.190> lot<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> room

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
quite obvious I don't have a lot of room

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
quite obvious I don't have a lot of room
to<00:01:39.210> play<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.080> I'm<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.130> try<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> do

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
to play with but I'm going to try to do

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
to play with but I'm going to try to do
as<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.900> can<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.430> I'm

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
as much as I can with what I have so I'm

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.740 
as much as I can with what I have so I'm
just<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.820> find<00:01:45.119> something<00:01:45.420> maybe

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
just going to find something maybe

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
just going to find something maybe
around<00:01:46.080> years<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.770> fold<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> kind<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.700> see

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
around years if I fold up I kind of see

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.190 
around years if I fold up I kind of see
this<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.270> crease<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.900> probably

I'm going to blend up I'm just going to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:42.750 
I'm going to blend up I'm just going to
pull<00:02:31.780> up<00:02:39.420> if<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:41.410> find<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:42.010> brush<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.640> little

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
pull up if you find this brush a little

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270 
pull up if you find this brush a little
bit<00:02:43.000> too<00:02:43.150> harsh<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.290> always<00:02:44.470> use<00:02:44.650> a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
bit too harsh you can always use a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550 
bit too harsh you can always use a
softer<00:02:46.150> brush<00:02:46.300> like<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:47.020> blend<00:02:47.440> out

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
softer brush like this and blend out

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.490 
softer brush like this and blend out
pulling<00:02:48.520> upwards<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.630> reason<00:02:49.930> why<00:02:50.140> this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
pulling upwards and the reason why this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500 
pulling upwards and the reason why this
purple<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.430> really<00:02:51.670> intense<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.120> because<00:02:52.330> we

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
purple is really intense is because we

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.570 
purple is really intense is because we
have<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.870> primer<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.040> first<00:02:54.070> set

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
have that primer and it's the first set

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.910 
have that primer and it's the first set
of<00:02:54.700> powder<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.120> sets<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.600> primer<00:02:56.080> that's<00:02:56.709> why

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
of powder it sets the primer that's why

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.500 
of powder it sets the primer that's why
it<00:02:57.040> shows<00:02:57.280> up<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.550> lot<00:02:57.580> more<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.209> if<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.360> were<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it shows up a lot more so if you were to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.170 
it shows up a lot more so if you were to
start<00:02:58.900> off<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.100> light<00:03:00.340> base<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.940> put<00:03:01.030> the

start off with a light base and put the
purple<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.840> won't<00:03:02.140> be<00:03:02.320> as<00:03:02.530> intense<00:03:03.280> as<00:03:03.520> this

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
purple on it won't be as intense as this
