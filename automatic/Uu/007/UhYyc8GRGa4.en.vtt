00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.950

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.340
 I guess it's a bit portable 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.090

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.700
 Ne 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:56.000

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.060
 I watched popular votes and post 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.400
 As I think I was the top of Onodera for 2 minutes until I did not remember Armor Day 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:11.010
 After all, this temple is not the most popular 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.900
 I while it was also like ÅŒno-ji By the way, say the members of videos
