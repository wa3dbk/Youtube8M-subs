00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
were scattered throughout the city

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.660 
were scattered throughout the city
sometimes<00:03:02.910> 8<00:03:03.720> kilometers<00:03:04.440> apart<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:05.310> from

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
sometimes 8 kilometers apart one from

sometimes 8 kilometers apart one from
the<00:03:05.820> other<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.300> there<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> lot<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.170> waste<00:03:07.590> by

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
the other so there was a lot of waste by

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.360 
the other so there was a lot of waste by
students<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.630> by<00:03:09.810> staff<00:03:10.190> travelling<00:03:11.190> between
