hello everyone my name is Tyler and this
week<00:00:02.550> I'll<00:00:02.760> be<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.179> over<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.600> color<00:00:03.840> by

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
week I'll be going over the color by

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.230 
week I'll be going over the color by
speed<00:00:04.440> tab<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.220> unity<00:00:05.549> particle<00:00:05.910> system

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
speed tab in the unity particle system

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.760 
speed tab in the unity particle system
and<00:00:06.509> I'll<00:00:06.810> be<00:00:06.899> showing<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.259> some<00:00:07.470> interesting

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
and I'll be showing you some interesting

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.570 
and I'll be showing you some interesting
things<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.990> do<00:00:10.080> with<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.580> for

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
things that you can do with it so for

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.700 
things that you can do with it so for
this<00:00:11.820> week<00:00:12.030> starting<00:00:12.540> particle<00:00:13.080> system<00:00:13.469> it's

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this week starting particle system it's

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.799 
this week starting particle system it's
the<00:00:14.040> default<00:00:14.580> particle<00:00:15.240> system<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.690> I've

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the default particle system but I've

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
the default particle system but I've
made<00:00:15.960> some<00:00:16.080> changes<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.859> are<00:00:16.949> kind<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
made some changes that are kind of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.279 
made some changes that are kind of
different<00:00:17.400> from<00:00:17.640> usual<00:00:17.789> I've<00:00:18.600> kept<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
different from usual I've kept the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.740 
different from usual I've kept the
initial<00:00:20.189> rotation<00:00:20.580> transform<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.630> I've

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
initial rotation transform but I've

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.259 
initial rotation transform but I've
zeroed<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> position<00:00:22.890> transform<00:00:23.460> I've

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
zeroed out the position transform I've

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.779 
zeroed out the position transform I've
changed<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> start<00:00:25.230> speed<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:26.130> zero<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
changed the start speed to be zero and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.609 
changed the start speed to be zero and
the<00:00:27.060> emission<00:00:27.510> rate<00:00:27.689> instead<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> ten

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the emission rate instead of ten

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
the emission rate instead of ten
particles<00:00:29.039> per<00:00:29.220> second<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.760> under

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
particles per second to be under

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.260 
particles per second to be under
particles<00:00:30.720> per<00:00:30.840> second<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.550> I've<00:00:33.030> also

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
particles per second and then I've also

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.729 
particles per second and then I've also
changed<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> starting<00:00:34.200> radius<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
changed the starting radius to be a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920 
changed the starting radius to be a
little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.040> larger<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.640> 2.5<00:00:36.000> instead<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.750> 1

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
little bit larger it's 2.5 instead of 1

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.229 
little bit larger it's 2.5 instead of 1
and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.219> an<00:00:38.760> initial<00:00:39.180> velocity<00:00:41.180> as<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and then I have an initial velocity as a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
and then I have an initial velocity as a
curve<00:00:42.750> or<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> velocity<00:00:43.860> over<00:00:44.040> lifetime<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
curve or a velocity over lifetime as a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
curve or a velocity over lifetime as a
curve<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.140> basically<00:00:46.920> just

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
curve and then I have it basically just

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
curve and then I have it basically just
a<00:00:47.219> straight<00:00:47.430> linear<00:00:47.640> line<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.690> going

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
a straight linear line that's going

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.220 
a straight linear line that's going
upwards<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> maximum<00:00:50.309> velocity<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.789> 10<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
upwards to a maximum velocity of 10 so

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.250 
upwards to a maximum velocity of 10 so
but<00:00:52.410> other<00:00:52.559> than<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> basic

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
but other than that it's the basic

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
but other than that it's the basic
particle<00:00:55.260> system<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.010> without<00:00:56.399> further<00:00:56.670> ado

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
particle system so without further ado

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.110 
particle system so without further ado
let's<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.390> started<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> color<00:00:59.579> by<00:00:59.820> speed

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
let's get started so the color by speed

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
let's get started so the color by speed
is<00:01:00.270> similar<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> color<00:01:00.899> over<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> lifetime<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
is similar to color over a lifetime and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.229 
is similar to color over a lifetime and
then<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.460> gives<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> gradient<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then it gives you a gradient to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.939 
then it gives you a gradient to
determine<00:01:03.780> what<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> particles<00:01:04.559> color<00:01:04.769> will

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
determine what the particles color will

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
determine what the particles color will
be<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.280> depending<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.180> certain<00:01:06.360> conditions

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
be like depending on certain conditions

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
be like depending on certain conditions
and<00:01:07.290> instead<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> over<00:01:08.549> time<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:09.720> gonna

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and instead of over time now we're gonna

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340 
and instead of over time now we're gonna
be<00:01:10.049> dealing<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:11.060> by<00:01:12.060> speed<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:13.140> here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
be dealing with by speed so down here

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
be dealing with by speed so down here
you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> speed<00:01:14.189> range<00:01:14.430> which

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you can see a speed range which

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.730 
you can see a speed range which
basically<00:01:15.479> means<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.420> particle<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.500> change

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
basically means the particle will change

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.910 
basically means the particle will change
color<00:01:20.060> depending<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> current<00:01:22.650> speed

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
color depending on the current speed

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100 
color depending on the current speed
that<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:24.780> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that it is in here so right now it's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.780 
that it is in here so right now it's
going<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:25.799> 0<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> 10<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.640> its

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
going from 0 to 10 so for the for its

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.270 
going from 0 to 10 so for the for its
color<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.689> color<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> particle<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.159> only

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
color the color for the particle is only

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.149 
color the color for the particle is only
going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.729> changed<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.170> going

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
going to be that changed when it's going

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
going to be that changed when it's going
from<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.759> speed<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> 0<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.540> 1<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.439> let's<00:01:37.590> change

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
from a speed of 0 to 1 so let's change

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.730 
from a speed of 0 to 1 so let's change
that<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:39.270> match<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.750> velocity<00:01:40.380> over<00:01:40.560> lifetime

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that to match our velocity over lifetime

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.460 
that to match our velocity over lifetime
over<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.400> from<00:01:41.610> 0<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> 10<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:43.049> let's<00:01:43.290> go

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
over here from 0 to 10 and then let's go

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
over here from 0 to 10 and then let's go
in<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.220> edit<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.850> gradients

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
in here and actually edit some gradients

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.670 
in here and actually edit some gradients
so<00:01:46.070> let's<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.310> give<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
so let's just give it

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.280 
so let's just give it
starting<00:01:49.040> color<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:51.500> final<00:01:52.130> color<00:01:53.230> so<00:01:54.230> as

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
starting color and a final color so as

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.770 
starting color and a final color so as
you<00:01:54.410> can<00:01:54.530> see<00:01:54.590> here<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:56.060> particle<00:01:56.510> is

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
you can see here the particle is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.880 
you can see here the particle is
changing<00:01:57.590> its<00:01:58.250> color<00:01:58.520> not<00:01:58.880> by<00:01:59.290> how<00:02:00.290> long<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
changing its color not by how long the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.550 
changing its color not by how long the
particle<00:02:01.400> has<00:02:02.210> been<00:02:02.479> living<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.050> for<00:02:03.410> how

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
particle has been living but for how

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.650 
particle has been living but for how
fast<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.979> particle<00:02:04.370> is<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.390> speed

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
fast the particle is going so at a speed

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.719 
fast the particle is going so at a speed
of<00:02:05.690> zero<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.590> particle<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:07.130> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.400> be<00:02:07.490> red

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
of zero the particle is going to be red

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.130 
of zero the particle is going to be red
and<00:02:07.970> then<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.539> gets<00:02:08.630> faster<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.080> faster

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
and then as it gets faster and faster

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.719 
and then as it gets faster and faster
it's<00:02:09.560> going<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.740> slowly<00:02:09.890> turn<00:02:10.130> into<00:02:10.340> pool

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
it's going to slowly turn into pool

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.410 
it's going to slowly turn into pool
purple<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.750> then<00:02:11.900> blue<00:02:11.930> sorry<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.240> can

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
purple and then blue sorry so you can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.000 
purple and then blue sorry so you can
see<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.750> pretty<00:02:14.930> clearly<00:02:15.050> right<00:02:15.590> here

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
see that pretty clearly right here

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.640 
see that pretty clearly right here
so<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.270> for<00:02:17.630> interesting<00:02:18.170> things<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.470> you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
so as for interesting things that you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.460 
so as for interesting things that you
can<00:02:18.800> do<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.600> as<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.780> can<00:02:20.870> kind<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.140> see<00:02:21.320> we

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
can do with it as you can kind of see we

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.100 
can do with it as you can kind of see we
have<00:02:21.590> us<00:02:21.770> almost<00:02:22.730> lava-lamp<00:02:23.300> looking<00:02:23.780> effect

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
have us almost lava-lamp looking effect

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.729 
have us almost lava-lamp looking effect
right<00:02:24.320> now<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:25.489> can<00:02:25.640> also<00:02:26.530> do<00:02:27.530> some

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
right now you can also do some

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.320 
right now you can also do some
interesting<00:02:27.980> things<00:02:28.220> with<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.700> alphas<00:02:29.090> as

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
interesting things with the alphas as

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.540 
interesting things with the alphas as
well<00:02:29.600> let's<00:02:30.350> see<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:31.010> do<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.370> right

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
well let's see if I can do that right

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.530 
well let's see if I can do that right
here<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.620> instead<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.040> having<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:34.850> opaque

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
here so instead of having it be opaque

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.830 
here so instead of having it be opaque
all<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.900> time<00:02:36.140> let's<00:02:36.410> make<00:02:36.620> our<00:02:36.770> particles<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
all the time let's make our particles a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.280 
all the time let's make our particles a
little<00:02:38.840> bit<00:02:40.060> more<00:02:41.060> interesting<00:02:41.750> by<00:02:41.989> having

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
little bit more interesting by having

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.100 
little bit more interesting by having
them<00:02:42.500> fade<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.070> fade<00:02:43.130> out<00:02:43.600> for<00:02:44.600> first<00:02:44.810> off

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
them fade in and fade out for first off

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.130 
them fade in and fade out for first off
and<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:46.430> instead<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.090> completely<00:02:47.630> opaque<00:02:47.930> we

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
and then instead of completely opaque we

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.540 
and then instead of completely opaque we
want<00:02:48.320> our<00:02:48.440> particles<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.130> little<00:02:49.430> bit

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
want our particles to have a little bit

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.360 
want our particles to have a little bit
of<00:02:49.640> transparency<00:02:50.200> just<00:02:51.200> makes<00:02:51.680> them<00:02:51.920> look<00:02:51.950> a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
of transparency just makes them look a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.090 
of transparency just makes them look a
little<00:02:52.400> bit<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:53.830> interesting<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:54.950> not

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
little bit more interesting and not

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.870 
little bit more interesting and not
quite<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.519> bright<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.590> let's<00:02:58.010> also<00:02:58.250> give<00:02:58.640> them

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
quite as bright so let's also give them

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.750 
quite as bright so let's also give them
some<00:02:58.910> interesting<00:02:59.690> velocities<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.920> instead

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
some interesting velocities so instead

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.190 
some interesting velocities so instead
of<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.090> having<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.420> straight<00:03:02.720> curve<00:03:02.989> system

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
of just having a straight curve system

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.600 
of just having a straight curve system
we're<00:03:03.500> just<00:03:03.650> gonna<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> random<00:03:04.340> between

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
we're just gonna have a random between

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.140 
we're just gonna have a random between
two<00:03:04.790> curves<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.780> then<00:03:06.140> let's<00:03:06.470> put<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.489> Z

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
two curves and then let's put the Z

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.800 
two curves and then let's put the Z
velocity<00:03:09.610> similar<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.299> original<00:03:11.390> one

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
velocity similar to the original one

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.420 
velocity similar to the original one
that<00:03:11.989> we<00:03:12.110> had<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:12.860> we're<00:03:12.980> not<00:03:13.040> going<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.250> change

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
that we had so we're not going to change

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.410 
that we had so we're not going to change
that<00:03:13.610> at<00:03:13.700> all<00:03:13.790> we're<00:03:13.910> going<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.060> have<00:03:14.120> both

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
that at all we're going to have both

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.300 
that at all we're going to have both
curves<00:03:14.660> be<00:03:14.930> identical<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:16.010> it'll<00:03:16.190> basically

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
curves be identical so it'll basically

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.539 
curves be identical so it'll basically
just<00:03:16.760> be<00:03:16.880> following<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.510> single<00:03:18.200> curve<00:03:18.590> instead

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
just be following a single curve instead

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.780 
just be following a single curve instead
of<00:03:19.850> two<00:03:20.720> curves<00:03:21.019> since<00:03:21.830> turned<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.280> off

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
of two curves since turned that off

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.990 
of two curves since turned that off
and<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:24.269> let's<00:03:24.450> put<00:03:24.689> these<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.379> down<00:03:26.000> here

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and then let's put these two down here

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.119 
and then let's put these two down here
actually<00:03:27.810> let's<00:03:28.019> change<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.680> one<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
actually let's change it to one of the

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.800 
actually let's change it to one of the
presets<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.700> we<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:29.939> from<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.480> earlier

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
presets that we have from the earlier

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
presets that we have from the earlier
tutorials<00:03:31.409> which<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.769> kind<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.040> this

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
tutorials which is kind of like this

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.270 
tutorials which is kind of like this
Wiggly<00:03:32.790> sine<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:33.810> cosine<00:03:34.230> wave<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.159> can

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
Wiggly sine and cosine wave so it can

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.710 
Wiggly sine and cosine wave so it can
kind<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.579> give<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:35.939> interesting<00:03:36.180> back<00:03:36.540> and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
kind of give an interesting back and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.630 
kind of give an interesting back and
forth<00:03:36.959> effect<00:03:37.349> for<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.950> particles<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.459> have

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
forth effect for the particles to have

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.420 
forth effect for the particles to have
let's<00:03:39.629> change<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.349> maximum<00:03:40.650> speed<00:03:41.129> a<00:03:41.190> little

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
let's change the maximum speed a little

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.000 
let's change the maximum speed a little
bit<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:43.230> copy<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:44.250> over<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:46.110> well<00:03:46.799> now<00:03:46.950> you

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
bit and copy that over and well now you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.280 
bit and copy that over and well now you
have<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.340> kind<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.090> interesting<00:03:48.720> spinny

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
have a kind of interesting spinny

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.099 
have a kind of interesting spinny
looking<00:03:50.129> colorful<00:03:50.730> effect<00:03:50.849> they<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.810> kind<00:03:52.019> of

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
looking colorful effect they can kind of

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.890 
looking colorful effect they can kind of
use<00:03:52.290> into<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> lava<00:03:52.890> lamp<00:03:53.540> which<00:03:54.540> will<00:03:54.720> actually

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
use into a lava lamp which will actually

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.809 
use into a lava lamp which will actually
be<00:03:55.319> able<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:55.859> little<00:03:56.069> bit<00:03:56.310> more<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.640> in

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
be able to do a little bit more of in

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.000 
be able to do a little bit more of in
the<00:03:57.000> next<00:03:57.359> week's<00:03:57.540> video<00:03:57.690> using<00:03:58.560> size<00:03:58.769> over

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the next week's video using size over

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.500 
the next week's video using size over
lifetime<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.519> we<00:03:59.609> can<00:03:59.760> change<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.120> size<00:04:00.359> of

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
lifetime so we can change the size of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.740 
lifetime so we can change the size of
the<00:04:00.599> particles<00:04:01.099> as<00:04:02.099> they<00:04:02.579> kind<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.569> go

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the particles as they kind of go

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.240 
the particles as they kind of go
throughout<00:04:04.019> their<00:04:04.260> lifetime<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.129> can

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
throughout their lifetime so you can

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.910 
throughout their lifetime so you can
change<00:04:05.459> their<00:04:05.609> size<00:04:05.819> over<00:04:06.030> time<00:04:06.060> basically

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
change their size over time basically

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.500 
change their size over time basically
that's<00:04:07.920> about<00:04:08.159> it<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:08.639> this<00:04:08.760> with<00:04:09.000> video

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that's about it for this with video

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.140 
that's about it for this with video
color<00:04:10.470> by<00:04:10.829> speed<00:04:11.129> is<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:11.430> similar<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.819> color

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
color by speed is very similar to color

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.229 
color by speed is very similar to color
over<00:04:12.389> a<00:04:12.420> lifetime<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.409> was<00:04:13.530> pretty<00:04:13.769> short

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
over a lifetime so it was pretty short

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.189 
over a lifetime so it was pretty short
but<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.329> can<00:04:15.480> do<00:04:15.569> some<00:04:15.750> interesting<00:04:15.989> things

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
but you can do some interesting things

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.370 
but you can do some interesting things
with<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.919> as<00:04:17.070> well<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.820> that's<00:04:18.389> that's<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.139> like

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
with it as well so that's that's it like

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.349 
with it as well so that's that's it like
