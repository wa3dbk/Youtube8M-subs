00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
then I think I just evolved a secret now
essentially<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> did<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.710> completely

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
essentially what I did to completely

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.929 
essentially what I did to completely
destroy<00:01:45.439> almost<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.770> entire<00:01:46.890> world<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.790> not

destroy almost my entire world if not
this<00:01:48.090> entire<00:01:48.450> chunk<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> space<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.700> to

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
this entire chunk of space is to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.270 
this entire chunk of space is to
essentially<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> did<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> took<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
essentially what I did is I took that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.069 
essentially what I did is I took that
one<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> presets<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.479> super<00:01:54.780> flats

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
one of the presets for the super flats

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.319 
one of the presets for the super flats
and<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.470> made<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> three<00:01:56.189> blocks<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.850> sand<00:01:57.090> over

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and I made it three blocks of sand over

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.910 
and I made it three blocks of sand over
like<00:01:57.600> 30<00:01:57.899> blocks<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.560> water<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.420> essentially

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
like 30 blocks and water so essentially

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
like 30 blocks and water so essentially
once<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.130> sands<00:02:02.369> broken<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.149> starts<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> fall

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
once the sands broken and starts to fall

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.539 
once the sands broken and starts to fall
then<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.649> entire<00:02:04.890> world's<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.369> gonna

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
then the entire world's is gonna

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.210 
then the entire world's is gonna
collapse<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> giant<00:02:06.750> prehistoric<00:02:07.220> eternal

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
collapse to a giant prehistoric eternal
