00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.339 

if<00:00:04.740> he<00:00:04.980> puts<00:00:05.190> them<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.549> right<00:00:05.700> up<00:00:05.819> there

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.249 

automatic<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.650> lab<00:00:17.540> our<00:00:18.540> class<00:00:18.900> leader

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
automatic in that lab our class leader

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.760 
automatic in that lab our class leader
in<00:00:19.410> our<00:00:19.619> cars<00:00:20.099> it's<00:00:20.340> always<00:00:21.060> very<00:00:21.149> weird

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
in our cars it's always very weird

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.620 
in our cars it's always very weird
feeling<00:00:22.770> if<00:00:22.860> an<00:00:23.489> engineer<00:00:24.029> tells<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.419> to<00:00:24.509> go

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
feeling if an engineer tells you to go

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.630 
feeling if an engineer tells you to go
quicker<00:00:24.899> because<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:26.040> know<00:00:26.160> most<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.489> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
quicker because you know most of the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.240 
quicker because you know most of the
time<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.939> our<00:00:27.059> class<00:00:27.329> we<00:00:27.360> are<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.220> nose<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
time in our class we are we are nose to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.220 
time in our class we are we are nose to
nose<00:00:29.579> we<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.180> are<00:00:30.270> bumper<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> bumper<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
nose we are we are bumper to bumper and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
nose we are we are bumper to bumper and
that<00:00:31.800> means<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.309> already<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.120> limit

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that means we are already on our limit

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.940 
that means we are already on our limit
and<00:00:33.630> then<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.020> know<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> gets<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> radian

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and then you know it gets on the radian

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
and then you know it gets on the radian
taste<00:00:35.450> portion<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.629> go<00:00:36.839> even<00:00:37.140> quicker<00:00:37.350> that's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
taste portion and go even quicker that's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
taste portion and go even quicker that's
that's<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.039> weird<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.820> motivates<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that's very weird but it's motivates and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.319 
that's very weird but it's motivates and
always<00:00:40.500> helps<00:00:40.769> a<00:00:40.829> little<00:00:40.980> bit<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.820> try<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> be

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
always helps a little bit we try to be

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.509 
always helps a little bit we try to be
you<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.019> limits<00:00:43.530> every<00:00:44.010> lip<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
you know on our limits every lip and

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.819 
you know on our limits every lip and
just<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.420> soon<00:00:46.550> have<00:00:47.550> fun<00:00:47.609> enjoy<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.870> there's<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
just as soon have fun enjoy it there's a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.739 
just as soon have fun enjoy it there's a
very<00:00:49.859> nice<00:00:50.159> example<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:51.089> I<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.629> was

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
very nice example and I think it was

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.319 
very nice example and I think it was
last<00:00:51.929> year<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.429> racing<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> really

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
last year I was racing and really

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
last year I was racing and really

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the track even a short track if you just

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
the track even a short track if you just
break<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.640> deeper<00:01:29.969> and<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.149> pick<00:01:30.329> up

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
break a little deeper and you pick up

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
break a little deeper and you pick up
throttle<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:31.049> couple<00:01:31.469> feet<00:01:31.619> earlier<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
throttle a couple feet earlier and you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
throttle a couple feet earlier and you
finish<00:01:33.030> too<00:01:33.270> wide<00:01:33.479> open<00:01:33.780> throttle<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.289> few<00:01:34.590> feet

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
finish too wide open throttle a few feet

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.160 
finish too wide open throttle a few feet
earlier<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.610> works<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.750> half<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
earlier that works out to be a half a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.350 
earlier that works out to be a half a
ten<00:01:37.350> maybe<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> corner<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:38.969> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
ten maybe in a corner right and if you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
ten maybe in a corner right and if you
can<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.869> every<00:01:39.960> corner<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.890> might<00:01:41.070> be

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
can do that in every corner you might be

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
can do that in every corner you might be
able<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.399> squeeze<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> few<00:01:42.000> tenths<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
able to squeeze a few tenths out of it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.330 
able to squeeze a few tenths out of it
you<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.319> a<00:01:43.350> couple<00:01:43.530> tents<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:43.950> least<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you know or a couple tents at least and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
you know or a couple tents at least and
that's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> big<00:01:45.270> difference<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.020> you're

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that's a big difference if you're

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.190 
that's a big difference if you're
already<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> limit<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.539> old<00:01:48.720> days<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
already on the limit in the old days it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.809 
already on the limit in the old days it
was<00:01:49.259> make<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:49.890> equipment<00:01:50.340> last<00:01:50.579> throughout

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
was make your equipment last throughout

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:51.969 
was make your equipment last throughout
the<00:01:50.880> race<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.569> used<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.840> be

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the race that's what it used to be

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
the race that's what it used to be
engineering<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.100> come<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.670> far<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.899> these

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
engineering has come so far in all these

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.809 
engineering has come so far in all these
years<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.590> never<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.280> making<00:01:56.640> equipment

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
years it's never about making equipment

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.270 
years it's never about making equipment
