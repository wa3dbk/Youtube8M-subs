the<00:03:37.580> blesser<00:03:37.940> -<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.180> wonder<00:03:38.420> if<00:03:38.450> that's<00:03:38.660> what<00:03:38.870> a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
the blesser - I wonder if that's what a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.250 
the blesser - I wonder if that's what a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
festivais looks like pastel mojave with

festivais looks like pastel mojave with

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
I'm referencing but this is a good thing

I'm<00:03:59.450> couldn't<00:03:59.810> even<00:04:01.599> many<00:04:02.599> people<00:04:02.959> have<00:04:03.110> asked

I'm couldn't even many people have asked

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.490 
I'm couldn't even many people have asked
us<00:04:03.560> why<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.010> cut<00:04:04.489> them<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:07.370> all<00:04:07.519> comes<00:04:07.790> down<00:04:07.910> to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
us why you cut them it all comes down to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.039 
us why you cut them it all comes down to
weak<00:04:09.500> babies<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.610> will<00:04:10.970> otherwise<00:04:11.209> die<00:04:11.870> in

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
weak babies that will otherwise die in

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.599 
weak babies that will otherwise die in
the<00:04:12.200> egg<00:04:13.060> that's<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.450> biggest<00:04:14.720> reason<00:04:15.110> but

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
the egg that's the biggest reason but

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.300 
the egg that's the biggest reason but
another<00:04:16.609> part<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.859> sometimes<00:04:18.859> they<00:04:19.100> get

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
another part of it is sometimes they get

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.800 
another part of it is sometimes they get
all<00:04:20.090> twisted<00:04:20.450> on<00:04:20.930> themselves<00:04:22.810> their

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
all twisted on themselves their

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.840 
all twisted on themselves their
umbilicus<00:04:24.530> gets<00:04:24.919> all<00:04:25.130> twisted<00:04:25.340> around<00:04:27.850> and

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
umbilicus gets all twisted around and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.060 
umbilicus gets all twisted around and
then<00:04:29.120> they<00:04:29.930> can't<00:04:30.200> make<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.410> out<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.800> echo

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
then they can't make it out of the echo

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.469 
then they can't make it out of the echo
in<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.190> room<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:34.370> sometimes<00:04:34.790> if<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.060> can<00:04:35.090> see

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
in the room so sometimes if you can see

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.650 
in the room so sometimes if you can see
that<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:37.220> helps<00:04:39.729> so<00:04:40.729> those<00:04:40.940> ones<00:04:41.150> because

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
that it helps so those ones because

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.560 
that it helps so those ones because
their<00:04:41.870> head<00:04:42.110> was<00:04:42.740> upside<00:04:43.190> down<00:04:43.430> they<00:04:44.360> wouldn't

their head was upside down they wouldn't

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
have been able DAP it well you know

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.610 
have been able DAP it well you know
cause<00:04:46.370> when<00:04:46.580> they're<00:04:47.110> when<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:48.229> start<00:04:48.500> to

cause when they're when they start to

cause when they're when they start to
hatch<00:04:48.800> if<00:04:49.640> this<00:04:49.850> is<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.030> snake's<00:04:50.419> head<00:04:50.630> here

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
hatch if this is a snake's head here

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.529 
hatch if this is a snake's head here
these<00:04:51.950> must<00:04:52.430> do<00:04:52.640> that<00:04:52.760> okay<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:52.970> if<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.390> is<00:04:53.510> a

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
these must do that okay so if this is a

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.510 
these must do that okay so if this is a
snake's<00:04:53.900> head<00:04:54.050> here<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.830> hatching<00:04:55.280> tooth

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
snake's head here the hatching tooth

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.900 
snake's head here the hatching tooth
will<00:04:55.669> be<00:04:55.700> right<00:04:55.970> on<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.270> tip<00:04:56.510> of<00:04:56.810> its<00:04:57.380> finger

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
will be right on the tip of its finger

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.029 
will be right on the tip of its finger
kind<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.260> on<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.289> tip<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.650> its<00:05:00.740> head<00:05:00.890> and

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
kind of like on the tip of its head and

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:01.690 
kind of like on the tip of its head and
though<00:05:01.100> this<00:05:01.160> finger

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
though this finger

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.310 
though this finger
clearly<00:05:01.970> so<00:05:02.539> like<00:05:02.690> so<00:05:03.160> so<00:05:04.180> did<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.360> yep<00:05:05.720> okay

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
clearly so like so so did you yep okay

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400 
clearly so like so so did you yep okay
so<00:05:06.919> these<00:05:07.610> muscles<00:05:07.970> at<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.810> base<00:05:09.080> of<00:05:09.110> their

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
so these muscles at the base of their

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.680 
so these muscles at the base of their
neck<00:05:09.620> there'd<00:05:10.100> be<00:05:10.280> their<00:05:10.820> jaw<00:05:11.120> comes<00:05:11.419> around

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
neck there'd be their jaw comes around

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.879 
neck there'd be their jaw comes around
like<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:11.990> then<00:05:12.229> their<00:05:12.350> head<00:05:12.470> gets<00:05:12.770> an

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
like that and then their head gets an

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.240 
like that and then their head gets an
arrow<00:05:13.210> these<00:05:14.210> muscles<00:05:14.690> right<00:05:14.780> here<00:05:15.250> they

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
arrow these muscles right here they

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.029 
arrow these muscles right here they
start<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.700> spasm<00:05:17.060> then<00:05:18.020> makes<00:05:18.680> their<00:05:18.860> head

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
start to spasm then makes their head

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.430 
start to spasm then makes their head
flick<00:05:19.639> back<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.389> then<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:21.050> little<00:05:21.320> egg

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
flick back and then that little egg

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.430 
flick back and then that little egg
tooth<00:05:21.650> makes<00:05:22.130> the<00:05:22.280> slits<00:05:22.990> if<00:05:23.990> they're<00:05:24.169> upside

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
tooth makes the slits if they're upside

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.650 
tooth makes the slits if they're upside
down<00:05:24.500> clearly<00:05:25.490> they<00:05:25.760> can't<00:05:25.940> do<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.389> because

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
down clearly they can't do that because

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.250 
down clearly they can't do that because
they're<00:05:27.470> in<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.680> wrong<00:05:27.800> position<00:05:28.010> so<00:05:28.910> then

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
they're in the wrong position so then

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.110 
they're in the wrong position so then
they<00:05:30.260> could<00:05:30.440> drown<00:05:30.770> in<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.340> egg<00:05:31.460> because<00:05:32.000> they

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
they could drown in the egg because they

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.040 
they could drown in the egg because they
can't<00:05:32.270> get<00:05:32.419> out<00:05:32.539> of<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.690> egg<00:05:32.810> they're

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
can't get out of the egg they're

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.830 
can't get out of the egg they're
oriented<00:05:33.320> groan<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.100> if<00:05:35.060> they<00:05:35.300> drown<00:05:35.570> in<00:05:35.720> the

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
oriented groan and if they drown in the

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.340 
oriented groan and if they drown in the
egg<00:05:36.160> just<00:05:37.160> because<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.930> then<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.139> lose

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
egg just because of that then you lose

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.990 
egg just because of that then you lose
another<00:05:39.650> wise<00:05:39.830> healthy<00:05:40.250> baby<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:40.729> made<00:05:40.880> it

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
another wise healthy baby that made it

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.360 
another wise healthy baby that made it
full-term<00:05:41.479> just<00:05:42.440> because<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.830> an<00:05:42.950> orientation

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
full-term just because of an orientation

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.059 
full-term just because of an orientation
problem<00:05:43.940> so<00:05:44.900> while<00:05:45.080> this<00:05:45.260> looks<00:05:45.560> gruesome<00:05:46.190> and
