hab<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.110> made<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:46.070> just<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
hab is made for that it's just that the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.149 
hab is made for that it's just that the
assembly<00:01:47.509> once<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.200> push<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.770> Emily

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950 

take<00:01:59.250> out

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
take out

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.039 
take out
the<00:02:01.470> ROI<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.860> heavy

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
the ROI is heavy

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.060 
the ROI is heavy
so<00:02:03.619> their<00:02:03.770> Wells<00:02:04.009> are<00:02:04.189> exposed<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.880> clean

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
so their Wells are exposed to clean

so their Wells are exposed to clean
no<00:02:06.580> one<00:02:06.730> you<00:02:06.850> will<00:02:07.000> do<00:02:07.120> is<00:02:07.510> you're<00:02:07.690> gonna<00:02:07.780> take

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.740 
because if if there's no even pressure
in<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.870> rollers<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.530> keep<00:02:16.810> running

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
in the rollers and you keep running

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
in the rollers and you keep running
very<00:02:20.500> simple<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:22.750> its<00:02:23.140> water<00:02:23.320> song

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
very simple and because its water song

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.910 
very simple and because its water song
it's<00:02:24.250> my<00:02:24.490> go<00:02:24.820> up

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.010

fresh back so now

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.000 
fresh back so now
if<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.560> them<00:02:40.740> they're<00:02:41.220> pristine

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
if you look at them they're pristine

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.979 
if you look at them they're pristine
because<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.790> always<00:02:44.000> clean<00:02:44.269> them<00:02:44.510> they're<00:02:44.750> like
