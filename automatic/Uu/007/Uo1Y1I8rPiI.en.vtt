00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
here at this intersection here because

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.179 
here at this intersection here because
you<00:01:06.390> can't<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.659> straight<00:01:06.720> obviously<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> what

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you can't go straight obviously and what

want to go right into this area and just

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
want to go right into this area and just
basically<00:01:12.659> when<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.320> doing<00:01:13.500> these

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
basically when you're doing these

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.140 
basically when you're doing these
pursuits<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> same

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pursuits you can kind of take the same

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
pursuits you can kind of take the same
strategy<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:15.750> different<00:01:16.080> events<00:01:16.140> but

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
strategy in two different events but

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
strategy in two different events but
it's<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> same<00:01:17.460> mentality<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.420> always

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it's the same mentality you can't always

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
it's the same mentality you can't always
go<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.020> straight<00:01:19.229> lane<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> straight<00:01:20.369> line

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
go in a straight lane or a straight line

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.280 
go in a straight lane or a straight line
down<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> freeway<00:01:21.479> expect<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> get<00:01:22.020> away<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
down the freeway expect to get away you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
down the freeway expect to get away you
can't<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.070> city<00:01:23.670> blocks<00:01:24.000> because

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
can't just go around city blocks because

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.490 
can't just go around city blocks because
there's<00:01:24.540> always<00:01:24.689> gonna<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.080> many<00:01:25.259> cops

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
there's always gonna be so many cops

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.929 
there's always gonna be so many cops
around<00:01:25.650> every<00:01:25.890> corner<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
around every corner so you have to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.240 
around every corner so you have to
figure<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> right<00:01:27.540> blend<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.250> evasion

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
figure out the right blend of evasion

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.999 
figure out the right blend of evasion
and<00:01:29.640> speed<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.439> areas<00:01:31.799> here

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and speed and going in these areas here

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
and speed and going in these areas here
that<00:01:32.040> aren't<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.909> industrial<00:01:33.240> are

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that aren't that I like industrial are

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.359 
that aren't that I like industrial are
really<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> your<00:01:34.680> best<00:01:34.860> bets<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.220> getting

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
really one of your best bets at getting

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
really one of your best bets at getting
away<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> cops<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.049> your

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
away from the cops and it's one of your

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.420 
away from the cops and it's one of your
better<00:01:37.259> chances<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> getting<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.189> next

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
better chances of getting them next

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.740 
better chances of getting them next
crash<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.600> them<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
crash because if you can get them to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
crash because if you can get them to
crash<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.350> definitely<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.829> away<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> lot

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
crash you can definitely get away a lot

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
crash you can definitely get away a lot
easier<00:01:41.700> great<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> almost<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.780> caught

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
easier great here I almost got caught

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
easier great here I almost got caught
again<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.520> second<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:45.000> third

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
again but this was my second or third

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
again but this was my second or third
time<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:45.810> beating<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.229> event<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.680> beat

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
time I think beating this event I beat

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.260 
time I think beating this event I beat
it<00:01:46.920> multiple<00:01:47.340> times<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.820> strategy<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it multiple times with a strategy to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
it multiple times with a strategy to
make<00:01:48.450> sure<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> wasn't<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.229> fluke<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
make sure it wasn't just a fluke and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.230 
make sure it wasn't just a fluke and
sometimes<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> cops<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.060> different

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
sometimes the cops are in different

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
sometimes the cops are in different
spots<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.170> runs<00:01:52.560> won't<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.040> as

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
spots and some runs won't be as

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
spots and some runs won't be as
successful<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.729> others<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
successful as others but if you do this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
successful as others but if you do this
strategy<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.430> I'd<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.180> 45

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
strategy right here I'd be it with 45

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.179 
strategy right here I'd be it with 45
seconds<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> spare<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> previous<00:01:58.979> time<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
seconds to spare in the previous time I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
seconds to spare in the previous time I
had<00:01:59.369> beaten<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.119> almost<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.540> minute<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
had beaten it with almost a minute to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
had beaten it with almost a minute to
spare<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> 2<00:02:01.979> minutes<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> 30<00:02:02.399> seconds<00:02:02.820> can

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
spare and 2 minutes and 30 seconds can

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.190 
spare and 2 minutes and 30 seconds can
be<00:02:03.119> pretty<00:02:03.270> hard<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.630> some<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:03.899> pursuits

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
be pretty hard in some of these pursuits

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.539 
be pretty hard in some of these pursuits
you<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.530> gotta<00:02:04.680> figure<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.070> strategy

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
you just gotta figure the right strategy

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
you just gotta figure the right strategy
I<00:02:05.729> failed<00:02:06.329> many<00:02:06.509> times<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.140> mission
