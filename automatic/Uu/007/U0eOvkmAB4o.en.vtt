00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.659
 how are you doing today's program are talking about saulo in the first game 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.430
 of the round of 16 against goiás by the cup of Brazil won by 1 to 0 more 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.430
 could have been for a more elastic score 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.950
 with this attitude of tito 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.840
 and the Sao-Pauline part knows how difficult it is to beat the goias in this 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:26.499
 in the previous 18 games, São Paulo had only won 3 and had a much better time 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.810
 and she was haunted by a stretched out dagobert 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720
 early in the second jean time 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 as an example of what is capable of hitting the prudent 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.360
 goal 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060
 to notice 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.570
 the supply among many 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.030
 a great result 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.290
 but projects silva does not 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.100
 Who can get out of here with 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 much better result for the cup São Paulo 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 to be very little even because we suffer a little of each thing 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.690
 gets complicated 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.350
 alex silva has his reasons there could have been a win by two goals 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 mainly because the goiás lost the time of the ball 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.900
 at 27 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.530
 ten minutes from the first half 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.850
 there with an extra player, São Paulo took a long time to risk the attack 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.170
 without being able to pierce the defensive blockade of the goiás the Sao-Paulians risked 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.470
 far drizzle 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.060
 kicks defended by a kidney 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.799
 the veteran goiás goalkeeper by the way was the one most responsible for the result 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.940
 skinny 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.270
 twice 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.190
 face to face with harlei 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.510
 led to the worst 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.680
 there was no way 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.530
 I suffered with the hit 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.900
 but this is a result that will split the Pauline views upside down 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.810
 from alex silva 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.009
 dagoberto thinks that when you win the first match away from home in the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.300
 kill Kill 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.500
 You must mourn the Brazil Cup anything else. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.320
 the goal of not missing out on home is already a big step throw playing in 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 your domains the team is fine 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.060
 heroines that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.560
 I do not think it's good once. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.950
 we have matches on the ground because it will also be very difficult to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.680
 is so good that even sliding he can give a little 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.369
 more 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:16.859
 the bid and only was not more interesting because the ball control made with the 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:17.570
 head 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.239
 by rafael tolói 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.670
 the show show apart but that did not change the result at all 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.759
 gradually to the transport 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.639
 são paulo one to zero we have the advantage of playing for the equalizer at home 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.669
 it's easier, but we have to respect 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:36.609
 the team from Goiás
