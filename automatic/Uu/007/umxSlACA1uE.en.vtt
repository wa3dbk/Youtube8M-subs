 know what to say about drivers 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.340
 developers in the nineties when still 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.150

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.050
 Russian demiurge and that's when recovery under 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.690
 the Russian developer name was 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.490
 rarity it was necessary to caress 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.120
 feed and protect these day 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.040
 the animals multiplied like rabbits and the fact that 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.110
 the game is being developed in Russia not to surprise 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.450
 even an american abroad is known our 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.820
 good project because apatite is logical 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.360

 other countries further 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.960
 failure can be treated calmly 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.810
 it turned out the order of things to sell up 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.010
 what did not touch the hand of three pirates 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.780
 at 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.110
 once an hour before the game in a particular newspaper 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 hour 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.190
 sick for the whole period 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.120
 the basis of all the transactions that you want 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.470
 where they poured water 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.550
 newspapers and increasing up the ball and tension 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.020
 but only big trouble for this game 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.689
 generally good for yourself 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.479

 the victims are already being called for by all people 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.600
 however, the review will be repeated and yes

 his four relatives pass 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.310
 regularly so take a look a little 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.619
 forward to the future and see how 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.250
 looks like a project that does not arrive 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.210
 computer so what unemployment 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.210
 the one who lost will be able to contact 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.939
 boys 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.519
 in general this year consists of two games 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.269
 single came up 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.499
 and the division into two types of disney is conditionally it 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.139
 not just two modes inside one project 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.529
 that this is really two different games we start and 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.079
 as usual company 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.249
 plot plot many have heard the more we 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.530
 showed with three games 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 us begin terrible nature 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.209
 operational memory of the war breaks out and 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 we are trying to understand all torpedo 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.060
 conclusions understand how they say 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.249
 winds are blowing 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.789
 the plot bought out something unreal 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.969
 writer but not created after 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.220
 fridge settings 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.630
 everything is pretty curious and even 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.190
 local russian good guys story 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.510
 Straight pleases that we are not 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.980
 next wins american

 Julia elections 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.219
 just now China 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.769
 but if you get the same from this 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.939
 process 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.019
 literally from the first minutes of dining in a row 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.029
 the story as shown is runaway and what we do 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.939
 fighting learns that japanese ccc 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.499
 tal battle developers do 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.119
 good imitation of your light 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.409
 sought to outdo Swedish 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.239
 project though in fact the game resembles and 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.949
 many other plots and strategies 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.430
 construction of the base of his confrontation 3d 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.750
 Classically mixes need to get to 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.360
 Sochi walk crowds of enemies need 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.480
 laying traditions have to hold them and 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.180
 accompany convoy tactics court it is 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.719
 developers gives us a mixed bag 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.849
 units which can 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.589
 interesting to read and group 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.329
 can be carried in various ways 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.819
 and different troops here is a simple project 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.179
 plus center indoor standings items about 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.099
 getting for an interesting idea using 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.189
 elementals ie weather phenomena 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.189
 for the benefit of 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.279
 here's tired of lying earthquake on him 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.469
 heathens or hurricane where would he know this 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.260
 ran into 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.609
 the truth is even such things attached 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.609
 if the squad end of the game will be and every 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.279
 time clapping led selected 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:15.439
 you tornado 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.430
 all natural union time is just powerful 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.150
 weapons in the hands of the general that however 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.809
 not bad 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.529
 as a result of the island elements halfway 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.489
 the Kurds are dense trying to get to 

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:27.039
 comma superbly closed was 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.379
 undertaken by the madness of the brave 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.659
 we sing a song 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.439
 but swedish garden our developers are so 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.179
 and did not take a seemingly excellent project 

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:34.479
 looks worse with a bit of it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.619
 directed by far less 

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:37.129
 professionally won the process 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.129
 not bad but not changed 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.090
 the developers really have a zagashnik 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.490
 also network mode 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.099
 not even so they have a full-fledged yagr 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.659
 huge growth 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.669
 but it should be full for now 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.110
 that she looks more like this one 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.129
 picture presenting ok when in 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.090
 the game is 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.110
 five people 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.909
 you fancy policy starcraft 2 district he 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.349
 right for those who sit less than a dozen people 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.110
 it's not very happy 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.520
 although the very idea of â€‹â€‹online 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.669
 constituent elements of it 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.990
 curious handed over the map of america which 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.680
 divided in half part of the territory 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.099
 belongs to the Russian part of the state for 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.189
 border province died 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.939
 four by four and sometimes 2 by 2 what 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.560
 work here also need to lay 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.340
 points only heads not 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.189
 alone to be and more and just seven 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.499
 years old 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.739
 purely visiting the place of another golf letter 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.449
 gabbalah we could even hear our 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.769
 positive reaction during 

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:27.620
 broadcast 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.229
 but the trouble is that now reduced 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.449
 which regulates personally but they went what 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.310
 Of course to play for Russia because the United States 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.250
 suffers experts they reflect the work but 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.410
 who is interested in bigboards 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.020
 artificial intelligence but it was 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.800
 this 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.520
 hence the problems of pumping 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.650
 I am very interested to deal with 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.270
 computer then they are especially eager 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.159
 get new titles 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.889
 do not lose one powerful types of technology 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.300
 really something I found still closed 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.830
 haiti speak in person 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.539
 but we will not evaluate yet we are young 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.740
 it's not fair the second part of the review is possible and 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.050
 at all that Kirill 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.909
 game you have not yet released history 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.659
 peek into the open this time 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.219
 and if the single day campaign 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:04.749
 deserves commendable cleaning 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:06.439
 multiplayer game crash 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.239
 it's too early to say a strike 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:10.209
 amazing but how strong will be 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:11.289
 after release radar
