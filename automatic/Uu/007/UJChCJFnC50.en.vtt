00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 Kammann 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.670
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.530
 third episode of tvk one does not meet 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.280
 only the right climate but also the right one 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.349
 right tone 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.990
 let's imagine we go to the 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.029
 production and our machines form 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.110
 we only need the orchestra there 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.110
 a dirigent 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.100
 that's good and so much 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.750
 classical in production 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.400
 Now I'm curious how the in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.350
 the construction may sound 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.580
 we find our next kampmann there 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.240
 heavy metal song made for chic 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.040
 the wm 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.580
 which is in front of the door and you can be 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.870
 of course, yes, I can 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.900
 not as good as mÃ¼ller and 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.070
 co 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.760
 but i can do my luck with that 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.110
 try wm-typing game by kampmann 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.090
 season there is the play in which it 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.010
 So you can enjoy great prices 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.750
 work colleagues friends and family 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.290
 drums together tap together 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.610
 win together 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.530
 that was it for this episode with Karmann 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.030
 tv turn it on next time 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.010
 Again , we have a wm 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.110
 special for yourself and up 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.500
 Thinking about it, you get exactly mine 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.500
 climate
