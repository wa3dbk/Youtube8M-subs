00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
till there you get it somewhere close to

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.030 
till there you get it somewhere close to
normal<00:03:49.310> tuning<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.920> once<00:03:52.280> you're<00:03:52.549> happy<00:03:52.790> just

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
normal tuning and once you're happy just

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.270 
normal tuning and once you're happy just
tighten<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:56.410> lock<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:59.500> this<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.860> exact

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
tighten the lock in and this to be exact

tighten the lock in and this to be exact
this<00:04:01.670> using<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.420> digital<00:04:03.410> tuner<00:04:03.859> or<00:04:04.070> as<00:04:04.670> an

you<00:04:09.200> get<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.799> correct<00:04:10.190> frequency

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
you get to the correct frequency

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.300 
you get to the correct frequency
and<00:04:12.220> that's<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.870> thanks<00:04:14.260> for<00:04:14.350> watching<00:04:14.770> see
