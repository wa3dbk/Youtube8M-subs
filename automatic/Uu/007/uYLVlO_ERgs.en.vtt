00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
first what you'll need to do is either

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.779 
first what you'll need to do is either
get<00:00:45.899> Odin<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.590> computer<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.160> flash<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
get Odin on your computer and flash it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.170 
get Odin on your computer and flash it
or<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.539> doing<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.050> mobile<00:00:49.620> odin<00:00:50.180> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
or I'm doing it with mobile odin so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
or I'm doing it with mobile odin so
mobile<00:00:51.989> odin<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.440> basically<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.860> odin

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
mobile odin is basically like odin

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
mobile odin is basically like odin
computer<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:53.879> i<00:00:53.940> find<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> easier<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.960> i<00:00:55.110> have

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
computer but i find it easier as i have

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
computer but i find it easier as i have
a<00:00:55.320> macintosh<00:00:55.980> computer<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> i<00:00:57.300> cannot<00:00:57.539> use<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

and<00:00:58.460> flash<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.760> odin<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.270> odin<00:01:00.539> does

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and flash with odin because odin does

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
and flash with odin because odin does
not<00:01:00.809> work<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.469> i<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.739> mobile<00:01:02.100> odin<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.520> flash

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
developer thread of the of the light
edition<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.290> should<00:01:34.680> work<00:01:34.710> properly<00:01:35.640> i

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
edition that should work properly i

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.480 
edition that should work properly i
think<00:01:36.240> i<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> pro<00:01:37.619> edition<00:01:37.829> only<00:01:38.100> has

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
think i think the pro edition only has

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.870 
think i think the pro edition only has
the<00:01:40.430> only<00:01:41.430> has<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.920> keeps<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.369> root<00:01:44.579> so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the only has the it keeps the root so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.249 
the only has the it keeps the root so
yeah<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> galaxy<00:01:47.780> s3<00:01:48.780> firmware

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
yeah so this is the galaxy s3 firmware

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.219 
yeah so this is the galaxy s3 firmware
for<00:01:49.439> 4.2<00:01:49.920> point<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:51.000> has<00:01:51.299> no<00:01:51.479> modem<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
for 4.2 point to this has no modem so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
for 4.2 point to this has no modem so
whatever<00:01:52.560> modem<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.610> it

whatever modem you have right now it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.319 
whatever modem you have right now it
will<00:01:53.939> stay<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> same<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.439> should<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.860> um

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
will stay the same so it should work um

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199 
so I'll have links down below for the
leaked<00:02:10.470> firmware<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.190> where<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.640> download<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
leaked firmware and where to download it

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
leaked firmware and where to download it
so<00:02:12.870> I'm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so I'm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
so I'm
when<00:02:14.219> you<00:02:14.370> download<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.090> should<00:02:15.629> come<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
when you download it should come in a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.949 
when you download it should come in a
dot<00:02:17.719> zip<00:02:18.719> file<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.260> when<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.969> compress<00:02:20.969> unzip

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
dot zip file and when you compress unzip

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.640 
dot zip file and when you compress unzip
it'll<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.469> a<00:02:22.500> dot<00:02:23.189> ta<00:02:23.519> our<00:02:23.790> md5<00:02:24.450> file<00:02:24.900> so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
it'll be in a dot ta our md5 file so

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.119 
it'll be in a dot ta our md5 file so
after<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.939> we<00:02:27.150> transfer<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.049> unzip<00:02:28.500> file<00:02:28.799> to

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
after that we transfer the unzip file to

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.410 
after that we transfer the unzip file to
your<00:02:29.689> device<00:02:31.250> preferably<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.609> internal<00:02:33.120> SD

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
your device preferably the internal SD

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.399 
your device preferably the internal SD
card<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.019> then<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.030> mobile<00:02:36.030> odin<00:02:36.269> we<00:02:36.900> should

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
card and then in mobile odin we should

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.459 
card and then in mobile odin we should
go<00:02:37.680> select<00:02:38.159> open<00:02:38.459> file<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.359> then<00:02:39.840> after<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
go select open file and then after that

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.750 
go select open file and then after that
we<00:02:41.069> will<00:02:41.310> select<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:43.730> make<00:02:44.730> sure

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
we will select it and then make sure

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
we will select it and then make sure
every<00:02:45.510> route<00:02:45.659> is<00:02:45.810> texture<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.590> still<00:02:47.040> have

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
every route is texture you still have

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.039 
every route is texture you still have
mobile<00:02:47.790> odin<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> that's<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.629> Pro<00:02:48.840> users

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
mobile odin and that's for Pro users

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.379 
mobile odin and that's for Pro users
only<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.879> want<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> root

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
only so and that is if you want to root

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.229 
only so and that is if you want to root
your<00:02:54.419> firmware<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.260> make<00:02:55.980> sure<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.669> enable

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
your firmware so make sure that enable

wipe data and cache a and wipe dalvik
cache<00:03:06.900> air<00:03:07.379> this<00:03:08.159> will<00:03:08.370> basically<00:03:08.519> perform<00:03:09.299> a

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
cache air this will basically perform a

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.690 
cache air this will basically perform a
clean<00:03:09.629> wipe<00:03:09.959> which<00:03:10.439> is<00:03:10.590> often<00:03:10.799> necessary<00:03:11.099> for

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
clean wipe which is often necessary for

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.780 
clean wipe which is often necessary for
installing<00:03:12.389> hot<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.959> firm<00:03:13.409> wins<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.919> then

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
installing hot on firm wins and then

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.750 
installing hot on firm wins and then
then<00:03:15.689> we<00:03:16.049> select<00:03:16.260> flash<00:03:16.650> firmware<00:03:18.440> so<00:03:19.440> we<00:03:20.040> will

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
then we select flash firmware so we will

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.229 
then we select flash firmware so we will
now<00:03:20.970> click<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.599> start<00:03:22.169> installation<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.239> we

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
now click on start installation and we

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.089 
now click on start installation and we
shall<00:03:24.449> continue<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.290> we<00:03:25.799> know<00:03:25.919> what

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
shall continue this as we know what

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.759 
shall continue this as we know what
we're<00:03:26.280> doing<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.180> yeah<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.199> continue<00:03:28.590> this

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
we're doing so yeah just continue this

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.729 
we're doing so yeah just continue this
it's<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.609> rooted<00:03:30.329> again<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:31.349> let's<00:03:31.620> go

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
it's just rooted again so let's go

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.069 
it's just rooted again so let's go
continue<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:33.090> let's<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:33.540> check<00:03:33.840> it

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
continue and now let's just check it

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.920 
continue and now let's just check it
just<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.650> case<00:03:34.680> should<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.669> pretty<00:03:36.090> quick<00:03:36.479> so

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
just in case should be pretty quick so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.349 
just in case should be pretty quick so
I'll<00:03:37.229> be<00:03:37.590> back<00:03:37.889> when<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.489> installation<00:03:38.519> is

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
I'll be back when the installation is

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.300 
I'll be back when the installation is
finished<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:40.049> yep

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.729 

so<00:03:46.310> now<00:03:46.969> that<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.510> installation<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.290> complete

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
so now that the installation is complete

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.289 
so now that the installation is complete
let's<00:03:48.769> go<00:03:49.099> to<00:03:49.159> the<00:03:49.310> sea<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.519> will<00:03:49.849> choose

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
let's go to the sea that will choose

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.089 
let's go to the sea that will choose
English<00:03:50.629> because<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.019> comes<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.499> this<00:03:51.680> random

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
English because it comes in this random

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.089 
English because it comes in this random
language<00:03:52.760> i<00:03:52.909> do<00:03:52.969> not<00:03:53.209> know<00:03:53.480> about<00:03:53.629> so<00:03:54.200> let's<00:03:54.920> go

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
language i do not know about so let's go
