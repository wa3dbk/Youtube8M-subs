00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.670
 so I show you today like me 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.100
 my porridge are doing something easy 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.110
 red 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.810
 and that's easy and I had to 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.480
 my super mega delicious and indeed take 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.490
 me a cup with me enough 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.689
 a small cup so a bigger one 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.689
 he does not help himself 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:41.730
 of this half oatmeal 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:45.390
 and a whole cup of water works 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 of course, with every cup size and that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 I'll leave it so little until now 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.750
 mean heat for a while 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 simmer 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 five to ten minutes and color this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.980
 more beautiful is with the oatmeal 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 in the pot I give coaching are then 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.850
 can you also other dried fruit 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.040
 take raisins mulberries what a 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.590
 could think of larger fruits 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.940
 cut small 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:21.720
 I give you therefore directly in the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:28.740
 pot is easy if you like a few 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 raisins I give also is the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.580
 heated and then immediately simmer 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.810
 I have a few others 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.880
 to prepare things 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 but those in my three do not come 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.270
 to be made warm before I have to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.270
 example peeled hand tame 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:54.380
 then I take two teaspoons and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.380
 Teaspoon fled his slices 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.730
 three tablespoons break can come to this 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.050
 you really back with the ingredients 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.000
 play from which you just because you see 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 it is here begins to simmer the making 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 I so that I already have the stove 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.910
 Issue because the rest just sit down 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.910
 enough so that it is a nice mush 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.090
 that's not just any apple 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.780
 chips now which costs from the leader 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.410
 Of course, not at all 190 or so and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.489
 the rubrics always a bit small 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.050
 they do not taste that good to me 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.340
 but in the format constantly the lick at 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:52.410
 I come as well as a little bit 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:54.459
 audited do more than 45 teaspoons 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.770
 small as I said I could with the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.270
 ingredients also play times or nuts 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.040
 other chopped nuts fit 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.380
 sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds I was yes 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.630
 always like to go for a break 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.239
 as far as the fruits are concerned 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.470
 dense rows there 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.560
 which is still with me is 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.090
 are and a little bit sweet and 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.180
 to get extra taste pure 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.750
 without sugar, agricultural index or something 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.750
 to use in fact always just in 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.970
 the news corp place or jam 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.090
 I preferred to do it myself 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.850
 for example, the apricot jam and 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.769
 that fits very well today with courses 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.660
 radlader because I myself as well as equal 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.110
 still apricot pieces freshly pure 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.110
 cutting edge 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.560
 Companies are just two and three 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.300
 good teaspoons now a few more 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.349
 cut small fresh fruits into 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.349
 my course also courses 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:25.210
 it is already finished so has 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.419
 within a maximum of ten minutes 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.919
 really healthy and filling meal 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.080
 I usually eat for breakfast 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.030
 but today it will be mine 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.030
