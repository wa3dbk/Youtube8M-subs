00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
so that you can kind of review with me a

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.750 
so that you can kind of review with me a
little<00:00:34.149> bit<00:00:34.270> what<00:00:35.230> this<00:00:35.649> whole<00:00:36.070> process

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
little bit what this whole process

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.729 
little bit what this whole process
really<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.750> we<00:00:37.929> start<00:00:38.350> out<00:00:38.530> with<00:00:38.559> a

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
really is so we start out with a

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.729 
really is so we start out with a
photocopy<00:00:39.399> wool<00:00:39.730> pattern<00:00:40.210> we<00:00:41.140> trace<00:00:41.499> the

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
photocopy wool pattern we trace the

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.160 
photocopy wool pattern we trace the
lines<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.399> cut<00:00:42.670> it<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:42.969> with<00:00:43.179> the<00:00:43.300> 6.99

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
lines and cut it in with the 6.99

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.520 
lines and cut it in with the 6.99
then<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.249> came<00:00:45.519> in<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.120> we<00:00:46.539> start<00:00:46.899> carving<00:00:47.260> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
then we came in and we start carving the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.590 
then we came in and we start carving the
background<00:00:48.100> usually<00:00:48.489> we<00:00:49.120> drop<00:00:49.420> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
background usually we drop the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.110 
background usually we drop the
background<00:00:50.109> next<00:00:50.579> once<00:00:51.579> we've<00:00:51.789> got<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
background next once we've got the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.970 
background next once we've got the
background<00:00:52.329> carved<00:00:53.140> then<00:00:53.289> we<00:00:53.469> come<00:00:53.679> in<00:00:53.829> and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
background carved then we come in and

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.040 
background carved then we come in and
start<00:00:54.309> shaping<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.999> individual<00:00:55.510> leaves<00:00:55.690> can

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
start shaping the individual leaves can

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.840 
start shaping the individual leaves can
you<00:00:56.140> see<00:00:56.350> how<00:00:56.559> we<00:00:56.620> started<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.309> text<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.789> the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
you see how we started the text of the

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.509 
you see how we started the text of the
leaves<00:00:58.059> here<00:00:58.449> then<00:00:59.109> we<00:00:59.350> start<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.920> round<00:01:00.190> the

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
leaves here then we start to round the

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.689 
leaves here then we start to round the
vines<00:01:00.819> a<00:01:01.120> little<00:01:01.359> bit<00:01:01.539> and<00:01:02.100> come<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:03.280> here<00:01:03.579> to

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
vines a little bit and come in here to

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.790 
vines a little bit and come in here to
where<00:01:03.819> we've<00:01:03.999> all<00:01:04.330> but<00:01:04.780> finished<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> pattern

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
where we've all but finished the pattern

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400 
where we've all but finished the pattern
up<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.250> then<00:01:07.060> drop<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.660> right<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.200> on<00:01:08.380> that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
up and then drop that right in on that

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.000 
up and then drop that right in on that
surface<00:01:08.950> then<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:10.510> stain<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.170> background<00:01:11.740> a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
surface then then stain the background a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.700 
surface then then stain the background a
little<00:01:12.190> bit<00:01:12.520> darker<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.240> voila<00:01:13.810> we've<00:01:14.470> got

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
little bit darker and voila we've got

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.460 
little bit darker and voila we've got
you<00:01:14.920> carving<00:01:15.430> in<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.640> range<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:17.110> matter<00:01:17.350> of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
you carving in a range in a matter of

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
you carving in a range in a matter of
hours<00:01:17.650> instead<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.520> days<00:01:18.640> or<00:01:19.150> even<00:01:19.420> years<00:01:19.630> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
hours instead of days or even years and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.190 
hours instead of days or even years and
we<00:01:21.490> can<00:01:21.670> cut<00:01:21.910> it<00:01:22.060> clear<00:01:22.330> to<00:01:22.450> finish<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.990> just

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
we can cut it clear to finish it just

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.080 
we can cut it clear to finish it just
looks<00:01:23.470> like<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.710> million<00:01:24.100> bucks<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.790> there's<00:01:24.970> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
looks like a million bucks and there's a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.030 
looks like a million bucks and there's a
practice<00:01:25.570> piece<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:26.140> isn't<00:01:26.530> something<00:01:26.800> that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
practice piece this isn't something that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.970 
practice piece this isn't something that
some<00:01:27.490> wizard<00:01:28.480> has<00:01:28.660> done<00:01:28.930> this<00:01:29.230> is<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> beginner

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980

different<00:01:53.500> than<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.800> need<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.130> kind<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.460> pay

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
different than you need to kind of pay

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.310 
different than you need to kind of pay
attention<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:55.150> what's<00:01:55.390> happened<00:01:55.870> here<00:01:56.050> this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
attention to what's happened here this

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.370 
attention to what's happened here this
is<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> finished<00:01:57.130> surface<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.870> stuck<00:01:59.200> that

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
is a finished surface and we stuck that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.040 
is a finished surface and we stuck that
pattern<00:01:59.920> down<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.190> came<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.360> trace<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
pattern down and came in and trace the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.250 
pattern down and came in and trace the
lines<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.910> once<00:02:03.910> we<00:02:04.120> trace<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.660> lines<00:02:04.900> then

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
lines and once we trace the lines then

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.680 
lines and once we trace the lines then
we<00:02:05.410> didn't<00:02:05.740> touch<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.340> again<00:02:06.820> we<00:02:07.360> just

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
we didn't touch this again we just

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.080 
we didn't touch this again we just
carved<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> background<00:02:08.800> down<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.670> reverse

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
carved the background down so we reverse

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.989 
carved the background down so we reverse
carve<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:11.980> negative<00:02:12.400> carving

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:12.999 
carve this this is a negative carving

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.420 
carve this this is a negative carving
back<00:02:13.209> in<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:13.810> or<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.019> relief<00:02:14.530> semi<00:02:15.040> relief

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
back in here or a relief semi relief

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.180 
back in here or a relief semi relief
kind<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.849> low

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
kind of low

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.610 
kind of low
it's<00:02:16.970> actually<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> drop<00:02:17.780> relief<00:02:18.170> because<00:02:18.440> it's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it's actually a drop relief because it's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.930 
it's actually a drop relief because it's
not<00:02:18.830> above<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> surface

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
not above the surface

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.570 
not above the surface
now<00:02:20.390> these<00:02:20.570> feathers<00:02:21.200> were<00:02:21.380> cut<00:02:21.740> out<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.220> this

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
now these feathers were cut out of this

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.450 
now these feathers were cut out of this
material<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.560> carved<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.770> glued<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
material and carved and glued on the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.230 
material and carved and glued on the
surface<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.930> that's<00:02:27.230> an<00:02:27.530> overlay<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.490> this<00:02:29.060> is

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
surface so that's an overlay and this is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.080 
surface so that's an overlay and this is
drop<00:02:29.540> relief<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.230> every<00:02:31.160> pattern<00:02:31.490> in<00:02:31.820> every

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
drop relief and every pattern in every

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.320 
drop relief and every pattern in every

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
design from leaves to feathers to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.900 
design from leaves to feathers to
wildlife<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:36.230> be<00:02:36.440> done<00:02:36.680> into<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> surface<00:02:37.760> of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
wildlife can be done into the surface of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.140 
wildlife can be done into the surface of
drop<00:02:38.150> relief<00:02:38.510> or<00:02:38.840> cut<00:02:39.680> out<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.340> carved<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
drop relief or cut out and carved and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.570 
drop relief or cut out and carved and
put<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.110> surface<00:02:42.560> itself<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.280> full

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
put on to the surface itself in full

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.830 
put on to the surface itself in full
relief<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:46.070> obviously<00:02:46.850> without<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.270> template

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
relief so obviously without a template

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.710 
relief so obviously without a template
in<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:47.990> pattern<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.610> most<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.270> us<00:02:50.450> would<00:02:50.690> be

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
in the pattern and most of us would be

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.870 
in the pattern and most of us would be
in<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.050> world<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.380> hurt<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:52.460> I<00:02:52.610> can<00:02:52.850> make

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
in a world of hurt but if I can make

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.940 
in a world of hurt but if I can make
that<00:02:53.090> pattern<00:02:53.540> stick<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.710> trace

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
that pattern stick that on and trace

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.990 
that pattern stick that on and trace
these<00:02:55.190> lines<00:02:56.860> we've<00:02:57.860> all<00:02:58.100> got<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.400> shot<00:02:58.790> at
