00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.370 

it<00:00:59.370> sounds<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:00.540> another<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.260> we

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
it sounds really good another thing we

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.200 
it sounds really good another thing we
like<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.700> tends<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> add<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
like about it is that it tends to add a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.360 
like about it is that it tends to add a
harmonic<00:01:03.960> sponge<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.589> almost<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.040> clean

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
harmonic sponge it's almost like a clean

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.950 
harmonic sponge it's almost like a clean
boost<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.360> words<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> makes<00:01:06.780> your

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
boost in other words it makes your

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
boost in other words it makes your
guitar<00:01:07.260> sound<00:01:07.590> bigger<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> better<00:01:08.610> than<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
guitar sound bigger and better than it
