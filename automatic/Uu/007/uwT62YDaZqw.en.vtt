in<00:03:55.560> fact<00:03:55.709> an<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:57.049> it's<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.110> D<00:03:58.260> shape<00:03:58.470> up<00:03:58.650> here

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
in fact an a but it's a D shape up here

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.259 
in fact an a but it's a D shape up here
on<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.159> 10th<00:03:59.640> 11th<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.180> 10th<00:04:01.519> and<00:04:02.519> then<00:04:02.760> this

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
on the 10th 11th and 10th and then this

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.030 
on the 10th 11th and 10th and then this
part<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.780> play<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.349> little<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.709> differently

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
part I play a little bit differently

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.479 
part I play a little bit differently
then<00:04:05.879> mr.<00:04:06.599> Koster<00:04:07.019> does<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.709> think<00:04:07.920> my<00:04:08.129> time

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
then mr. Koster does but I think my time

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.180 
then mr. Koster does but I think my time
is<00:04:08.519> just<00:04:08.640> as<00:04:08.879> cool<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.900> it's<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.440> little<00:04:11.010> more

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
is just as cool and it's a little more

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.210 
is just as cool and it's a little more
interesting<00:04:11.989> but<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.620> then<00:04:14.010> you're<00:04:14.129> gonna

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
interesting but so then you're gonna

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.430 
interesting but so then you're gonna
slide<00:04:14.489> from<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.819> 8th<00:04:15.030> fret<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.019> 10th<00:04:16.289> fret

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
slide from the 8th fret to the 10th fret

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.759 
slide from the 8th fret to the 10th fret
to<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.590> 8th<00:04:16.709> fret<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:18.299> then<00:04:18.419> 6th<00:04:19.350> fret<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:19.709> the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
to the 8th fret and then 6th fret on the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.029 
to the 8th fret and then 6th fret on the
E<00:04:19.889> string<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.959> then<00:04:22.139> here<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.650> this<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.010> a

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
E string and then here this is this is a

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.640 
E string and then here this is this is a
tricky<00:04:23.340> part<00:04:23.370> you're<00:04:23.729> going<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.320> start<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.380> half

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
tricky part you're going to start a half

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.180 
tricky part you're going to start a half
step<00:04:25.949> up<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> bend<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:26.970> come<00:04:27.360> down<00:04:28.190> then

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
step up on a bend and come down then

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.540 
step up on a bend and come down then
pull<00:04:29.400> off<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.690> fourth<00:04:30.960> fret<00:04:31.199> um<00:04:31.550> yeah

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
pull off to the fourth fret um yeah

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.129 
pull off to the fourth fret um yeah
start<00:04:32.910> up<00:04:33.090> your<00:04:33.330> starting<00:04:33.630> on<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.780> sixth<00:04:34.050> fret

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
start up your starting on the sixth fret

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.820 
start up your starting on the sixth fret
but<00:04:34.410> bent<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.919> half<00:04:35.039> step<00:04:35.220> then<00:04:36.830> you're

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
but bent up a half step then you're

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.029 
but bent up a half step then you're
gonna<00:04:37.919> pull<00:04:38.160> off<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:39.710> fourth<00:04:40.710> fret<00:04:40.889> there

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
gonna pull off to the fourth fret there

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.320 
gonna pull off to the fourth fret there
and<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.220> recommend<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.789> use<00:04:41.820> this<00:04:42.060> index

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
and I recommend that you use this index

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330 
and I recommend that you use this index
finger<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:43.410> damp<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.800> e<00:04:43.860> string<00:04:44.160> when<00:04:44.250> you're

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
finger to damp that e string when you're

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.640 
finger to damp that e string when you're
doing<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.990> when<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.169> do<00:04:46.289> that<00:04:46.440> pull

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
doing this so so when you do that pull

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.960 
doing this so so when you do that pull
off<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:48.300> doesn't<00:04:48.600> ring

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.430 

and<00:04:52.970> then

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.340 

so<00:05:00.440> after<00:05:00.590> you've<00:05:00.710> been<00:05:00.800> been<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.940> pull<00:05:02.120> off

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
so after you've been been you pull off

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.450 
so after you've been been you pull off
you<00:05:03.350> can<00:05:03.500> hit<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.710> fifth<00:05:03.919> fret<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.280> g

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
you can hit the fifth fret of the g

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.210 
you can hit the fifth fret of the g
string<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.389> then<00:05:06.139> an<00:05:06.260> open<00:05:06.380> g<00:05:06.680> string<00:05:06.710> in<00:05:07.130> the

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
string and then an open g string in the

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.640 
string and then an open g string in the
fourth<00:05:07.430> fret<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:07.970> B<00:05:08.570> string

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
fourth fret of the B string

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.440 
fourth fret of the B string
so<00:05:11.650> collectively<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.430> crazy<00:05:12.880> part<00:05:13.150> here<00:05:13.300> is

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
so collectively this crazy part here is

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:35.040 
so collectively this crazy part here is
uh

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.340 

so<00:05:36.050> then<00:05:36.199> after<00:05:36.290> that<00:05:36.530> it<00:05:36.620> goes<00:05:38.229> does<00:05:39.229> this

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
so then after that it goes does this

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.540 
so then after that it goes does this
little<00:05:39.650> slide<00:05:39.860> up<00:05:39.979> to<00:05:40.100> this<00:05:40.220> chord<00:05:40.460> what

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
little slide up to this chord what

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.710 
little slide up to this chord what
you've<00:05:40.669> seen<00:05:40.820> before<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:46.400> little<00:05:47.300> D<00:05:47.449> shaped

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
you've seen before the little D shaped

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.050 
you've seen before the little D shaped
chord<00:05:48.050> again<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:51.410> that's<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:52.580> pinkie<00:05:52.850> astir

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
chord again and that's you pinkie astir

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.750 
chord again and that's you pinkie astir
going<00:05:53.270> up<00:05:53.360> there<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.810> twelfth<00:05:54.080> fret<00:05:54.760> g

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
going up there to the twelfth fret g

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:05.880 
going up there to the twelfth fret g
string<00:05:57.970> then<00:05:58.970> eighth<00:05:59.240> fret<00:05:59.479> of<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.780> g<00:06:00.110> string

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.740 

and<00:06:06.890> so<00:06:07.040> that's<00:06:07.250> that<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:10.330> I'll<00:06:11.330> play<00:06:11.480> slowly

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
and so that's that and I'll play slowly

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:54.439 
and so that's that and I'll play slowly
and<00:06:11.930> then<00:06:12.020> up<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.200> speed

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449
