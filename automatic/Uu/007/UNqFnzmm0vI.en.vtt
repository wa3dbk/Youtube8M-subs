first<00:00:00.359> I'll<00:00:00.480> go<00:00:00.599> over<00:00:00.870> how<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.050> turn<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> plain

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
first I'll go over how to turn a plain

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.300 
first I'll go over how to turn a plain

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
cellophane plastic tape covered one like

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.160 
cellophane plastic tape covered one like
this<00:00:08.160> one<00:00:10.219> or<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.019> it<00:00:13.019> actually

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this one or this one and it actually

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.730 
this one or this one and it actually
starts<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:14.750> covering<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.139> piece<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
starts with covering the piece of

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.920 
starts with covering the piece of
foamboard<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.699> before<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.300> actually<00:00:18.539> even

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
foamboard first before you actually even

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.759 
foamboard first before you actually even
make<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.380> wing<00:00:20.960> now<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.230> ordinary

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
make the wing now this is ordinary

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.920 
make the wing now this is ordinary
packing<00:00:23.400> tape<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> common<00:00:24.600> clear

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
packing tape this is the common clear

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.689 
packing tape this is the common clear
stuff<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.529> works<00:00:25.769> fine<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.400> course<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
stuff which works fine but of course it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.160 
stuff which works fine but of course it
doesn't<00:00:26.849> impart<00:00:27.180> any<00:00:27.390> color<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.930> ends<00:00:28.109> up

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
doesn't impart any color it ends up

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
doesn't impart any color it ends up
being<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.470> white<00:00:28.730> like<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> foam<00:00:30.090> board

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
being a white like the foam board

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
being a white like the foam board
although<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.779> quite<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.410> brilliant<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:31.980> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
although not quite as brilliant this is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.930 
although not quite as brilliant this is
actually<00:00:32.460> white<00:00:32.640> tape<00:00:34.489> but<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> comes<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
actually white tape but it comes in a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.139 
actually white tape but it comes in a
lot<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> colors<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.280> freely<00:00:38.730> find<00:00:39.030> on

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
lot of colors you can get freely find on

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.610 
lot of colors you can get freely find on
the<00:00:39.239> Internet<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> ends<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the Internet and that ends up with a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
the Internet and that ends up with a
pretty<00:00:41.190> nice<00:00:41.430> brilliant<00:00:41.790> shiny<00:00:42.210> color<00:00:42.540> like

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
pretty nice brilliant shiny color like

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.940 
pretty nice brilliant shiny color like
this<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.739> blue<00:00:43.920> tape<00:00:45.559> now<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> main

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this one is the blue tape now the main

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
this one is the blue tape now the main
trick<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.700> process<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.210> getting<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
trick in this process is getting the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.959 
trick in this process is getting the
tape<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.200> lay<00:00:49.410> down<00:00:49.440> flat<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.160> straight<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
tape to lay down flat and straight and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.170 
tape to lay down flat and straight and
parallel<00:00:51.410> all<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:53.070> way<00:00:53.160> down<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.610> length<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
parallel all the way down the length of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
parallel all the way down the length of
the<00:00:54.300> board<00:00:54.829> I've<00:00:55.829> done<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> helper<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the board I've done with a helper is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.790 
the board I've done with a helper is
probably<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.899> easier<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> way<00:00:58.680> I've

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
probably much easier but the way I've

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.430 
probably much easier but the way I've
done<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.160> my<00:00:59.340> own<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.539> tape<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
done it on my own is I just tape it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
done it on my own is I just tape it
around<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.010> edge<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.370> surface<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> desk

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
around the edge of a surface like a desk

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.050 
around the edge of a surface like a desk
or<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> kitchen<00:01:04.500> island<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.220> counter<00:01:05.610> I've<00:01:05.820> used

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
or a kitchen island or counter I've used

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.760 
or a kitchen island or counter I've used
a<00:01:06.210> piece<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> half-inch<00:01:07.049> particle<00:01:08.010> board<00:01:08.189> here

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
a piece of half-inch particle board here

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
a piece of half-inch particle board here
and<00:01:10.909> before<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> start<00:01:12.750> applying<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and before that you start applying the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
and before that you start applying the
tape<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.830> best<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> ensure<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
tape it's best to ensure that it is the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
tape it's best to ensure that it is the
tape<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> lined<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.740> perfectly<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.759> edge

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
tape is lined up perfectly with the edge

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
tape is lined up perfectly with the edge
here<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.229> tape<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> coming<00:01:20.040> off<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
here that the tape is coming off the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.380 
here that the tape is coming off the
Roll<00:01:21.320> perpendicular<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.060> like<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> roll

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
Roll perpendicular to the like the roll

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.010 
Roll perpendicular to the like the roll
itself<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.580> lined<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.299> with

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
itself and that this is lined up with

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480 
itself and that this is lined up with
where<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> tape<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> end<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> going

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
where you want the tape to end up going

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.890 
where you want the tape to end up going
and<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.759> helps<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> ensure<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.659> goes

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and that helps to ensure that it goes

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
and that helps to ensure that it goes
all<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.320> down<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.710> board<00:01:31.950> straight<00:01:35.000> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
all the way down the board straight so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.450 
all the way down the board straight so
then<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.420> you'll<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:38.479> hold<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> tape<00:01:40.460> all

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
then what you'll do is hold the tape all

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.260 
then what you'll do is hold the tape all
the<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.820> down<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.810> use<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.790> credit<00:01:44.790> card<00:01:44.909> or

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the way down and I use a credit card or

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.770 
the way down and I use a credit card or
a<00:01:45.329> gift<00:01:45.600> card<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> help<00:01:46.320> put<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> stuff<00:01:47.520> down

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
a gift card to help put this stuff down

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
a gift card to help put this stuff down
flat<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> try<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> finger<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.369> tends

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
flat if you try to use a finger it tends

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
flat if you try to use a finger it tends
to<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> wrinkle<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to get a wrinkle in it like that and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
to get a wrinkle in it like that and
tends<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> lay<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:52.950> flat<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.270> just

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
tends not to lay down flat so I just

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.090 
tends not to lay down flat so I just
take<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> card<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.590> top<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
take the card put it right on top of the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.050 
take the card put it right on top of the
tape<00:01:56.659> like<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.799> line<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.610> right<00:01:59.820> with

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060

with the card the tape is taut and
parallel<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> edge<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.740> board<00:02:08.039> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
parallel with the edge of the board just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
parallel with the edge of the board just
enough<00:02:08.970> tension<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> flat<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.289> then

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
enough tension to get it flat and then

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.010 
enough tension to get it flat and then
press<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.280> down<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.879> usually<00:02:12.599> give<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> little

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
press it down I usually give it a little

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.550 
press it down I usually give it a little
press

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
press

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.020 
press
right<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> end<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> board<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:14.880> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
right at the end of the board like that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:25.100 
right at the end of the board like that
to<00:02:15.540> hold<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.870> down<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.560> cut<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.190> off<00:02:24.110> you'll

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
to hold it down and cut this off you'll

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.309 
to hold it down and cut this off you'll
see<00:02:25.319> it's<00:02:25.440> applied<00:02:26.360> nice<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.569> evenly<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
see it's applied nice and evenly to the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.559 
see it's applied nice and evenly to the
edge<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.989> end<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.380> nice<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.569> without

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
edge now this end is nice and without

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.589 
edge now this end is nice and without
wrinkles<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.849> can<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.120> spread<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.540> out

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
wrinkles so you can just spread that out

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.290 
wrinkles so you can just spread that out
like<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:39.510> end<00:02:39.750> you'll<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:40.050> has<00:02:40.230> well

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
like that this end you'll see has well

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.770 
like that this end you'll see has well
some<00:02:42.300> wrinkles<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:44.280> seems<00:02:44.519> that

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
some wrinkles to it and it seems that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.030 
some wrinkles to it and it seems that
the<00:02:45.780> best<00:02:45.810> way<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> alleviate<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the best way to alleviate that is to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920 
the best way to alleviate that is to
pull<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.640> little<00:02:47.910> tension<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.510> notice<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
pull a little tension and notice the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.870 
pull a little tension and notice the
tape<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.709> really<00:02:49.860> attached<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.549> board

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
tape is really attached to the board

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.330 
tape is really attached to the board
that<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.840> foam<00:02:52.380> board<00:02:52.560> sitting<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.130> not

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that the foam board sitting on is not

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.680 
that the foam board sitting on is not
really<00:02:53.670> pushed<00:02:53.940> down<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.269> foam<00:02:54.480> board

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
really pushed down to the foam board

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.630 
really pushed down to the foam board
itself<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.200> allows<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> stretch<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
itself so that allows you to stretch it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.839 
itself so that allows you to stretch it
taut<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:59.090> then<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.120> sort<00:03:00.450> of

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
taut like this and then just sort of

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.600 
taut like this and then just sort of
smooth<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:03.150> your<00:03:03.540> card<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
smooth it out with your card like that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.860 
smooth it out with your card like that
once<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.760> looks<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.239> pretty<00:03:06.420> wrinkling

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
once it looks like it's pretty wrinkling

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.160 
once it looks like it's pretty wrinkling
bubble<00:03:07.200> free<00:03:07.849> you<00:03:08.849> can<00:03:09.030> take<00:03:09.209> into<00:03:09.450> making

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
bubble free you can take into making

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.089 
bubble free you can take into making
nice<00:03:10.620> long<00:03:10.890> strokes<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:12.920> next<00:03:13.920> get

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
nice long strokes like this next get

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.800 
nice long strokes like this next get
ready<00:03:14.280> for<00:03:14.459> your<00:03:14.610> second<00:03:15.060> row<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.239> tape<00:03:15.569> like

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
ready for your second row of tape like

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.920 
ready for your second row of tape like
this<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.560> I've<00:03:17.250> left<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.850> tape<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.570> over

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
this and I've left this tape going over

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.509 
this and I've left this tape going over
the<00:03:19.079> edge<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.680> still<00:03:19.890> taped<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the edge and it's still taped to the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.569 
the edge and it's still taped to the
board<00:03:20.730> underneath<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.450> lap<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.950> two

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
board underneath so lap this about two

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.979 
board underneath so lap this about two
millimeters<00:03:25.160> by<00:03:26.160> setting<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.000> roll<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.930> tape

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
millimeters by setting the roll of tape

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.620 
millimeters by setting the roll of tape
two<00:03:28.769> millimeters<00:03:29.250> over<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:31.170> adjacent<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:32.630> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
two millimeters over the adjacent on the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.210 
two millimeters over the adjacent on the
first<00:03:33.840> row<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.109> case<00:03:34.350> let<00:03:34.739> me<00:03:34.799> move<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
first row of case let me move that a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.440 
first row of case let me move that a
little<00:03:35.430> bit<00:03:35.519> like<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:38.180> using<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.269> same

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
little bit like this and using the same

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.240 
little bit like this and using the same
method<00:03:39.840> tape<00:03:40.049> over<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.470> edge<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
method tape over the edge so that the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.860 
method tape over the edge so that the
overlap<00:03:43.010> right<00:03:44.010> there<00:03:44.549> is<00:03:45.030> two<00:03:45.329> millimeters

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
overlap right there is two millimeters

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.170 
overlap right there is two millimeters
in<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.019> overlap<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.920> roll<00:03:47.160> itself<00:03:47.639> over

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
in the overlap of the roll itself over

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.530 
in the overlap of the roll itself over
the<00:03:48.209> stripe<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:50.130> same<00:03:50.400> amount<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.000> I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the stripe is the same amount and I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.330 
the stripe is the same amount and I
usually<00:03:51.780> just<00:03:51.930> kind<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.109> eyeball<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.620> two<00:03:53.250> or

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
usually just kind of eyeball that two or

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.710 
usually just kind of eyeball that two or
three<00:03:53.489> millimeters<00:03:53.970> or<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> quarter<00:03:54.569> inch

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
three millimeters or so a quarter inch

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.500 
three millimeters or so a quarter inch
and<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.380> helps<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.829> ensure<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.519> pull

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
and that helps to ensure that you pull

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.350 
and that helps to ensure that you pull
the<00:03:57.540> tape<00:03:57.810> roll<00:03:58.079> out

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
the tape roll out

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.650 
the tape roll out
and<00:04:00.260> end<00:04:00.500> up<00:04:00.740> down<00:04:01.280> here<00:04:01.700> an<00:04:02.000> overlap<00:04:02.420> at<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
and end up down here an overlap at the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.630 
and end up down here an overlap at the
same<00:04:02.870> amount<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.800> tape<00:04:04.010> started<00:04:04.490> off

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
same amount that the tape started off

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.310 
same amount that the tape started off
going<00:04:04.940> straight<00:04:05.270> at<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.660> other<00:04:05.810> end<00:04:06.050> before

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
going straight at the other end before

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.270 
going straight at the other end before
you<00:04:06.500> even<00:04:06.740> started<00:04:07.190> moving<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.800> then<00:04:09.920> do<00:04:10.130> that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
you even started moving and then do that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.430 
you even started moving and then do that
same<00:04:10.460> trick<00:04:10.490> with<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.000> cart<00:04:11.300> pushing<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.290> down

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
same trick with the cart pushing it down

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.100 
same trick with the cart pushing it down
nice<00:04:12.710> and<00:04:12.950> flat<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.490> once<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.570> see<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.840> it's

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
nice and flat and once you see that it's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.020 
nice and flat and once you see that it's
overlap<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.830> right<00:04:15.950> amount<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.459> push<00:04:16.880> it

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
overlap the right amount just push it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.060 
overlap the right amount just push it
right<00:04:17.060> down<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.410> give<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.680> last<00:04:18.890> little

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
right down and give that last little

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.910 
right down and give that last little
part<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.459> little<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.959> little<00:04:20.959> rub<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.380> stick<00:04:21.799> it

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
part a little a little rub to stick it

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.380 
part a little a little rub to stick it
there<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.490> then<00:04:22.670> you<00:04:22.700> can<00:04:22.880> go<00:04:23.000> back<00:04:23.210> and

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
there and then you can go back and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:42.880 
there and then you can go back and
smooth<00:04:24.380> out<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.740> rest<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.530> end<00:04:42.680> up<00:04:42.710> with

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
smooth out the rest if you end up with

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.470 
smooth out the rest if you end up with
any<00:04:43.040> bubbles<00:04:43.400> like<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:44.000> can<00:04:44.150> just<00:04:44.300> kind

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
any bubbles like this you can just kind

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.630 
any bubbles like this you can just kind
of<00:04:44.600> put<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> couple<00:04:45.650> little<00:04:45.770> tiny<00:04:46.070> holes<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.520> it

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
of put a couple little tiny holes in it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.300 
of put a couple little tiny holes in it
let<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.420> deflate<00:04:47.930> partly<00:04:48.470> by<00:04:48.590> itself<00:04:48.920> and<00:04:49.220> then

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
let it deflate partly by itself and then

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.040 
let it deflate partly by itself and then
just<00:04:49.520> finish<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.820> up<00:04:50.000> with<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.410> card<00:04:51.410> like<00:04:51.620> that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
just finish it up with a card like that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.590 
just finish it up with a card like that
you<00:04:54.050> should<00:04:54.230> go<00:04:54.350> right<00:04:54.530> away<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:56.210> depending<00:04:56.510> on

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
you should go right away so depending on

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.500 
you should go right away so depending on
what<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.840> perfectionist<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.680> are<00:04:58.000> if<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.270> want

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
what a perfectionist you are if you want

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.330 
what a perfectionist you are if you want
the<00:04:59.750> tape<00:05:00.050> from<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.500> leading<00:05:00.770> edge<00:05:00.980> to

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
the tape from the leading edge to

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.090 
the tape from the leading edge to
overlap<00:05:01.820> each<00:05:02.090> successive<00:05:02.740> piece<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.890> tape

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
overlap each successive piece of tape

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.040 
overlap each successive piece of tape
behind<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:04.880> would<00:05:04.970> actually<00:05:05.090> stop<00:05:05.690> if<00:05:05.990> you

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
behind it you would actually stop if you

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.870 
behind it you would actually stop if you
knew<00:05:06.290> how<00:05:06.470> long<00:05:06.500> your<00:05:06.770> cord<00:05:06.980> was<00:05:07.160> stop<00:05:07.460> here

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
knew how long your cord was stop here

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.030 
knew how long your cord was stop here
and<00:05:08.030> then<00:05:08.600> start<00:05:08.990> applying<00:05:09.230> the<00:05:09.620> tape<00:05:09.770> from

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
and then start applying the tape from

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.130 
and then start applying the tape from
the<00:05:10.130> outside<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.880> like<00:05:11.090> this<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.810> this

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
the outside in like this so that this

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.960 
the outside in like this so that this
would<00:05:12.320> be<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.530> leading<00:05:12.770> edge<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.850> would

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
would be the leading edge and it would

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.270 
would be the leading edge and it would
overlap<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.660> lower<00:05:15.350> surface<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.040> upper

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
overlap the lower surface and the upper

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.860 
overlap the lower surface and the upper
surface<00:05:16.460> tape<00:05:16.850> behind<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.540> they<00:05:17.720> would

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
surface tape behind it and they would

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.420 
surface tape behind it and they would
like<00:05:18.110> fish<00:05:18.350> scales<00:05:18.620> cover<00:05:18.950> each<00:05:19.100> other<00:05:19.280> all

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
like fish scales cover each other all

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.490 
like fish scales cover each other all
the<00:05:19.460> way<00:05:19.610> back<00:05:19.850> so<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:20.930> one<00:05:21.140> overlaps

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
the way back so that this one overlaps

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.470 
the way back so that this one overlaps
this<00:05:21.710> one<00:05:21.919> overlaps<00:05:22.250> this<00:05:22.460> one<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:22.880> then<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
this one overlaps this one and then the

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
this one overlaps this one and then the
same<00:05:23.660> would<00:05:23.840> apply<00:05:23.870> along<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.010> top<00:05:26.440> okay<00:05:27.440> so

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
same would apply along the top okay so

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.710 
same would apply along the top okay so
I've<00:05:27.800> done<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.640> red<00:05:29.000> which<00:05:29.210> will<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.510> top

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
I've done the red which will be the top

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.210 
I've done the red which will be the top
of<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.960> wing<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.320> at<00:05:30.740> this<00:05:30.890> point<00:05:31.130> I

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
of the wing and at this point I

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.340 
of the wing and at this point I
transitioned<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.880> yellow<00:05:32.540> partly<00:05:33.110> so<00:05:33.260> you

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
transitioned to yellow partly so you

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.080 
transitioned to yellow partly so you
could<00:05:33.500> see<00:05:33.650> it<00:05:33.770> better<00:05:33.919> but<00:05:34.250> this<00:05:34.730> is<00:05:34.880> going<00:05:35.030> to

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
could see it better but this is going to

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.870 
could see it better but this is going to
be<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.270> leading<00:05:35.450> edge<00:05:35.690> right<00:05:36.080> here<00:05:36.700> at<00:05:37.700> this

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
be the leading edge right here at this

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.340 
be the leading edge right here at this
point<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.240> want<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.510> kind<00:05:38.720> of<00:05:38.780> set<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.200> the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
point you want to kind of set in the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.350 
point you want to kind of set in the
tape<00:05:39.590> by<00:05:39.770> using<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.310> like<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.640> t-shirt<00:05:41.030> or<00:05:41.060> a

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
tape by using a like a t-shirt or a

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.260 
tape by using a like a t-shirt or a
cotton<00:05:41.960> cloth<00:05:42.080> or<00:05:42.410> a<00:05:42.440> paper<00:05:42.530> towel<00:05:42.830> just<00:05:43.270> rub

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
cotton cloth or a paper towel just rub

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.719 
cotton cloth or a paper towel just rub
it<00:05:44.300> down<00:05:44.419> all<00:05:44.900> over<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.410> place<00:05:45.650> at<00:05:46.100> this<00:05:46.370> point

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
it down all over the place at this point

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.000 
it down all over the place at this point
that<00:05:47.660> tape<00:05:47.930> is<00:05:48.110> going<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.350> become<00:05:48.680> one<00:05:48.979> with

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
that tape is going to become one with

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.920 
that tape is going to become one with
the<00:05:49.310> paper<00:05:49.520> if<00:05:49.790> you<00:05:49.880> try<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.150> peel<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.390> off<00:05:50.660> the

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
the paper if you try and peel it off the

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.830 
the paper if you try and peel it off the
paper<00:05:51.110> is<00:05:51.320> coming<00:05:51.620> with<00:05:51.740> it<00:05:51.910> so<00:05:52.910> this<00:05:53.479> is<00:05:53.600> kind

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
paper is coming with it so this is kind

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.210 
paper is coming with it so this is kind
of<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:53.960> final<00:05:54.290> step<00:05:54.500> before<00:05:54.650> you<00:05:54.860> start

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
of the final step before you start

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.450 
of the final step before you start
making<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.520> into<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.820> way

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
making it into the way

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.210 
making it into the way
so
