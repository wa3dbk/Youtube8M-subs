00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.010 
hours I think they think it's gonna be a
lot<00:00:55.350> worse<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:57.059> really

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
lot worse than it really is but really

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.049 
lot worse than it really is but really
it's<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.350> evaluation<00:00:58.670> we'll<00:00:59.670> run<00:01:00.000> them

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
suit through some shooting and passing

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
suit through some shooting and passing
drills<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.670> we'll<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:02.969> over<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.449> three

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
