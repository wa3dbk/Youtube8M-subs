then breaking downhill so it's going to

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.080 
then breaking downhill so it's going to
be<00:00:40.210> very<00:00:40.360> high<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.800> when<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:42.640> get<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.000> the

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
to reset the average fuel about me

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.840 
to reset the average fuel about me
and<00:00:50.649> then<00:00:51.010> we're<00:00:51.190> going<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.399> see<00:00:51.579> where<00:00:51.760> it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
and then we're going to see where it

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.420 
and then we're going to see where it
levels<00:00:52.180> out<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.870> haven't<00:00:53.620> done<00:00:53.710> this<00:00:53.949> since<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
levels out I haven't done this since the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.790 
levels out I haven't done this since the
last<00:00:54.610> couple<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.090> months<00:00:55.239> when<00:00:55.690> he<00:00:55.809> was<00:00:56.019> being

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.580 

right<00:01:07.259> now<00:01:08.090> let's<00:01:09.090> separate<00:01:09.509> children<00:01:09.810> while

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
right now let's separate children while

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
right now let's separate children while

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
getting 33 miles per gallon they all

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.820 
getting 33 miles per gallon they all
think<00:05:45.699> of<00:05:45.879> it<00:05:45.969> it's<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.240> old<00:05:46.509> you<00:05:47.259> know<00:05:47.349> passes

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
think of it it's the old you know passes

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.050 
think of it it's the old you know passes
everything<00:05:48.310> but<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.550> gas<00:05:48.759> pump<00:05:50.279> or<00:05:51.279> off<00:05:51.729> of<00:05:51.969> the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
everything but a gas pump or off of the

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.450 
everything but a gas pump or off of the
bridge<00:05:52.270> now<00:05:52.800> there's<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.860> little<00:05:54.129> bit<00:05:54.279> of<00:05:54.370> an

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
bridge now there's a little bit of an

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.969 
bridge now there's a little bit of an
incline<00:05:54.789> so<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.419> pilot<00:05:56.020> always<00:05:56.349> drops<00:05:56.620> and

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
incline so the pilot always drops and

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.399 
incline so the pilot always drops and
there's<00:05:57.279> a<00:05:57.610> little<00:05:58.300> bit<00:05:58.419> of<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.599> down<00:05:58.779> B<00:05:58.990> also<00:05:59.319> it

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
there's a little bit of a down B also it

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.030 
there's a little bit of a down B also it
comes<00:05:59.590> back

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.840 

and<00:06:05.040> then<00:06:05.220> we<00:06:05.430> have

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
and then we have

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.870 
and then we have
another<00:06:07.330> good<00:06:07.570> straightaway<00:06:08.170> here<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:09.580> so

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
another good straightaway here and so

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.670 
another good straightaway here and so
the<00:06:10.000> average<00:06:10.120> coming<00:06:10.630> up<00:06:10.870> like<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.320> is<00:06:11.470> just

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
the average coming up like that is just

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.000 
the average coming up like that is just
run<00:06:11.920> just<00:06:12.160> to<00:06:12.460> slide<00:06:12.790> downhill<00:06:13.120> a<00:06:13.420> moment

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.570 

now<00:06:18.490> it's<00:06:18.700> levelled<00:06:19.060> out<00:06:19.150> again

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:39.449 

switch<00:06:25.360> back<00:06:25.720> over<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:26.199> instant

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:39.459 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:43.929 

we've<00:06:40.459> got<00:06:40.699> another<00:06:41.269> mile<00:06:41.599> or<00:06:41.839> so<00:06:42.050> cruise<00:06:42.939> and

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
we've got another mile or so cruise and

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:51.790 
we've got another mile or so cruise and
a<00:06:44.059> level<00:06:44.389> stayed<00:06:44.779> like<00:06:44.989> this

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:07:01.620 

the<00:06:52.800> average<00:06:53.220> is

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.420 

I<00:07:01.950> wanted<00:07:02.950> to<00:07:03.070> do<00:07:03.250> this<00:07:03.430> all<00:07:03.670> in<00:07:03.700> one<00:07:03.910> long<00:07:04.450> cut

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
I wanted to do this all in one long cut

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.730 
I wanted to do this all in one long cut
just<00:07:06.430> to<00:07:06.750> sure<00:07:07.750> that<00:07:08.050> it's<00:07:08.200> pretty<00:07:08.470> consistent

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
just to sure that it's pretty consistent

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:23.969 
just to sure that it's pretty consistent
and<00:07:09.430> what<00:07:09.910> it<00:07:10.060> does
