00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
pretty cool and this is a corrosive spin

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.410 
pretty cool and this is a corrosive spin
we<00:03:59.709> just<00:03:59.920> agree<00:04:00.250> they<00:04:00.489> could<00:04:00.520> turn<00:04:00.940> up<00:04:01.830> down

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
we just agree they could turn up down

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.080 
we just agree they could turn up down
180<00:04:04.420> degrees<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.170> your<00:04:05.290> guys<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:06.970> there
