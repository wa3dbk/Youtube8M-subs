00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
and I also have to say when I call

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.350 
and I also have to say when I call
something<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:29.530> Antonio<00:01:30.280> Sanchez<00:01:30.700> lick<00:01:31.090> or

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
something like Antonio Sanchez lick or

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
or Jimmy Cobb lick it doesn't necessary

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.370 
or Jimmy Cobb lick it doesn't necessary
mean<00:01:33.160> they<00:01:33.729> invented<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.479> lick<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:35.170> just

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
mean they invented the lick it just

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.760 
mean they invented the lick it just
means<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:35.740> where<00:01:35.979> I<00:01:36.099> heard<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.819> from<00:01:37.000> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
means that's where I heard it from so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.350 
means that's where I heard it from so
look<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.920> know<00:01:39.039> vocabulary<00:01:39.729> like<00:01:39.910> in<00:01:40.179> any

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
look you know vocabulary like in any

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.570 
look you know vocabulary like in any
language<00:01:40.660> is<00:01:41.319> going<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.679> get<00:01:41.800> passed<00:01:42.009> around<00:01:42.399> a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
language is going to get passed around a

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.990 
language is going to get passed around a
lot<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.860> usually<00:01:45.280> why<00:01:45.429> I<00:01:45.459> just<00:01:45.759> pick

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
lot so that's usually why I just pick

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.999 
lot so that's usually why I just pick
somebody<00:01:46.390> wherever<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.170> pick<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.530> up<00:01:47.619> from<00:01:47.860> us

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
somebody wherever I pick it up from us

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.660 
somebody wherever I pick it up from us
who<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.220> give<00:01:49.209> it<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.539> essentially<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.490> don't

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
who I give it to essentially so I don't

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.430 
who I give it to essentially so I don't
know<00:01:51.759> kyndra<00:01:52.300> came<00:01:52.479> up<00:01:52.599> with<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:52.810> or<00:01:52.990> Antonio

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
know kyndra came up with this or Antonio

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.469 
know kyndra came up with this or Antonio
or<00:01:53.800> whatnot<00:01:54.099> but<00:01:54.280> they<00:01:54.520> both<00:01:54.670> use<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.330> it's

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
or whatnot but they both use it and it's

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.910 
or whatnot but they both use it and it's
a<00:01:55.569> great<00:01:55.750> phrase<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.259> ultimately<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:56.890> really

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
a great phrase and ultimately it really

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.370 
a great phrase and ultimately it really
it<00:01:57.280> really<00:01:57.310> doesn't<00:01:57.729> matter<00:01:57.819> so<00:01:58.569> let's<00:01:59.170> go

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
it really doesn't matter so let's go

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.529 
it really doesn't matter so let's go
over<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.679> Kendrick<00:02:00.069> Scott<00:02:00.310> phrase<00:02:00.610> it's

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
over this Kendrick Scott phrase it's

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.199 
over this Kendrick Scott phrase it's
it's<00:02:01.899> gonna<00:02:02.770> be<00:02:02.890> three<00:02:03.099> beats<00:02:03.310> long<00:02:03.580> it's

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
it's gonna be three beats long it's

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:10.139 
it's gonna be three beats long it's
gonna<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.539> in<00:02:04.630> triplets<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.489> very

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
gonna be in triplets so this is very

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.630 
gonna be in triplets so this is very
slow<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.709> going<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.920> go<00:02:12.040> over<00:02:12.190> three<00:02:12.430> beats

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
slow it's going to go over three beats

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.240 
slow it's going to go over three beats
so<00:02:12.910> nine<00:02:13.150> triplets<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.380> goes<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.739> a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
so nine triplets and it goes like this a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:29.589 
so nine triplets and it goes like this a
one<00:02:15.819> two

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.750 

so<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:30.930> three<00:02:31.410> beats<00:02:31.620> three<00:02:32.459> sets<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so it's three beats three sets of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:52.460 
so it's three beats three sets of
triplets<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:50.599> when<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.110> phrase

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
triplets so when you get to that phrase

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.100 
triplets so when you get to that phrase
for<00:02:53.220> me<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:54.390> right<00:02:54.599> there<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> middle

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
for me you see right there in the middle

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.620 
for me you see right there in the middle
you<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:58.760> which<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.000> little<00:03:00.209> Antonio

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
you have the which that little Antonio

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
you have the which that little Antonio
Sanchez<00:03:00.870> licked<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.160> we<00:03:02.280> were<00:03:02.370> pointing

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
Sanchez licked it that we were pointing

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.660 
Sanchez licked it that we were pointing
out<00:03:02.849> right<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.980> you've<00:03:04.980> got<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.160> triple<00:03:05.430> before

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
out right so you've got a triple before

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.259 
out right so you've got a triple before
that<00:03:06.590> which<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.799> left<00:03:08.250> mute<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:08.849> gonna<00:03:08.970> stick

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
that which is left mute it's gonna stick

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.210 
that which is left mute it's gonna stick
on<00:03:09.450> stick<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.989> then<00:03:10.560> after<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.099> get

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
on stick and then after that we get

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.160 
on stick and then after that we get
those<00:03:11.700> four<00:03:12.030> strokes<00:03:12.360> from<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> Antonio

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
those four strokes from the Antonio

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.780 
those four strokes from the Antonio
Sanchez<00:03:13.560> video<00:03:14.930> right<00:03:15.930> right

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
Sanchez video right right

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.940 
Sanchez video right right
and<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:18.569> we<00:03:18.660> end<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> with<00:03:19.019> two<00:03:19.319> notes<00:03:19.709> on<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
and then we end it with two notes on the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.190 
and then we end it with two notes on the
bass<00:03:20.069> drum<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.430> round<00:03:20.610> out<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> trip

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.510 

now<00:03:26.200> if<00:03:26.980> they're<00:03:27.400> sticking<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:29.520> getting

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
now if they're sticking to this getting

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.090 
now if they're sticking to this getting
getting<00:03:31.000> those<00:03:31.210> stick<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.660> sticks<00:03:32.020> nice<00:03:32.830> and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
getting those stick on sticks nice and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.480 
getting those stick on sticks nice and
clean<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.640> also<00:03:34.390> getting<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:35.290> left<00:03:35.560> hand<00:03:35.890> to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
clean and also getting the left hand to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.910 
clean and also getting the left hand to
play<00:03:36.730> play<00:03:37.420> strokes<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.020> then<00:03:38.140> mutes<00:03:38.440> if

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
play play strokes and then mutes if

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.720 
play play strokes and then mutes if
that's<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.430> little<00:03:39.640> difficult<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:42.400> play<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
that's a little difficult just play the

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.430 
that's a little difficult just play the
phrase<00:03:42.970> without<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.510> stick<00:03:43.690> on<00:03:43.840> stick<00:03:44.140> for<00:03:44.380> a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
phrase without the stick on stick for a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:04:07.620 
phrase without the stick on stick for a
while<00:04:05.490> moving<00:04:06.490> around<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.180> drums<00:04:07.420> as<00:04:07.600> well

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
while moving around the drums as well

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.449 
while moving around the drums as well
but<00:04:07.930> ultimately<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.380> think<00:04:08.410> what<00:04:08.920> makes<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.310> hip

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
but ultimately I think what makes it hip

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.180 
but ultimately I think what makes it hip
is<00:04:10.420> getting<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:10.959> stick<00:04:11.230> on<00:04:11.350> stick<00:04:11.650> sound<00:04:11.950> in

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
is getting that stick on stick sound in

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.220 
is getting that stick on stick sound in
there<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:12.670> if<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.300> need<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.630> practice<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.170> very

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
there so if you need to practice it very

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.009 
there so if you need to practice it very
slowly<00:04:15.060> getting<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.180> stick<00:04:16.419> on<00:04:16.510> stick<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.900> be

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
slowly getting that stick on stick to be

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.550 
slowly getting that stick on stick to be
nice<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.470> clean<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.510> but<00:04:19.989> at<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.140> same<00:04:20.350> time

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
nice and clean and but at the same time

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.930 
nice and clean and but at the same time
if<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.769> want<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.010> use<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.400> faster<00:04:21.790> tempo

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
if you want to use it in a faster tempo

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.240 
if you want to use it in a faster tempo
until<00:04:22.419> that<00:04:22.600> gets<00:04:22.780> comfortable<00:04:23.350> just<00:04:23.980> leave

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
until that gets comfortable just leave

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.220 
until that gets comfortable just leave
out<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.610> stick<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.940> stick<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.690> just<00:04:25.870> play<00:04:26.110> it

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
out the stick on stick and just play it

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.840 
out the stick on stick and just play it
right<00:04:26.350> on<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.590> snare<00:04:26.770> drum<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:27.250> still<00:04:27.460> sounds

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
right on the snare drum it still sounds

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:36.720 
right on the snare drum it still sounds
good<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:29.140> accent<00:04:29.650> pattern<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:36.310> accent

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
good and the accent pattern the accent

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.490 
good and the accent pattern the accent
pattern<00:04:36.820> if<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.419> listen<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.260> follow

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
pattern if you just listen to and follow

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.980 
pattern if you just listen to and follow
your<00:04:38.770> right<00:04:39.070> hand

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.090 

you're<00:04:43.990> gonna<00:04:44.139> you're<00:04:44.410> gonna<00:04:44.500> hear<00:04:44.919> the

you're gonna you're gonna hear the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.159 
you're gonna you're gonna hear the
phrase<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:46.120> rest<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.509> stuff<00:04:46.720> will<00:04:46.840> smooth

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
phrase the rest of the stuff will smooth

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.439 
phrase the rest of the stuff will smooth
out<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.889> won't<00:04:48.039> be<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:48.430> clunky<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:49.060> lot<00:04:49.240> of<00:04:49.300> times

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
out it won't be so clunky a lot of times

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.749 
out it won't be so clunky a lot of times
we<00:04:49.569> have<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.720> phrase<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.380> long<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:51.550> many

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
we have a phrase this long so many

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.629 
we have a phrase this long so many
strokes<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.360> many<00:04:52.539> things<00:04:52.780> involved<00:04:53.190> as<00:04:54.190> we

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
strokes so many things involved as we

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.210 
strokes so many things involved as we
speed<00:04:55.060> up<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.539> can<00:04:55.780> all<00:04:56.169> those<00:04:56.380> feet<00:04:56.889> start<00:04:57.190> to

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
speed up it can all those feet start to

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.189 
speed up it can all those feet start to
compress<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.360> starts<00:04:58.569> to<00:04:58.630> sound<00:04:58.780> tense

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
compress and it starts to sound tense

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.710 
compress and it starts to sound tense
the<00:04:59.919> way<00:05:00.069> to<00:05:00.130> loosen<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:00.789> up<00:05:00.849> is<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.509> just

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
the way to loosen that up is to just

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.779 
the way to loosen that up is to just
focus<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.380> bigger<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:03.039> bigger<00:05:03.250> beats<00:05:03.580> or

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
focus on the bigger the bigger beats or

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.520 
focus on the bigger the bigger beats or
in<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:03.970> case<00:05:04.210> it's<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.870> little<00:05:05.110> accent

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
in this case it's the little accent

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.740 
in this case it's the little accent
matter<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.250> me<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:07.090> easiest<00:05:07.120> one<00:05:07.630> to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
matter and to me the easiest one to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.120 
matter and to me the easiest one to
follow<00:05:07.900> is<00:05:08.169> going<00:05:08.289> to<00:05:08.349> be<00:05:08.500> in<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.919> just

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
follow is going to be in that it just

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.559 
follow is going to be in that it just
just<00:05:09.310> just<00:05:09.400> literally<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.090> follow<00:05:10.300> with<00:05:10.539> the

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
just just literally to follow with the

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.900 
just just literally to follow with the
strokes<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.050> your<00:05:11.169> right<00:05:11.349> hand

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
strokes in your right hand

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.249 
strokes in your right hand

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
DEP DEP DEP DEP DEP DEP that way it will

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.680 
DEP DEP DEP DEP DEP DEP that way it will
smooth<00:05:17.650> out<00:05:17.860> as<00:05:18.099> it<00:05:18.430> gets<00:05:18.580> faster<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.570> me

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
smooth out as it gets faster but to me

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.270 
smooth out as it gets faster but to me
this<00:05:19.870> works<00:05:20.050> as<00:05:20.199> a<00:05:20.229> nice<00:05:20.410> medium<00:05:20.800> tempo<00:05:21.130> as

this works as a nice medium tempo as

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.689 
this works as a nice medium tempo as
well

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699
