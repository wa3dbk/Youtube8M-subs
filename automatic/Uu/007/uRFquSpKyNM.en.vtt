a little sand trap you can do and
basically<00:00:06.990> you're<00:00:07.350> supposed<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> build<00:00:08.069> this

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
basically you're supposed to build this

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.400 
basically you're supposed to build this
underground<00:00:09.210> but<00:00:09.719> I'm<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> show<00:00:10.380> you

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
underground but I'm going to show you

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.589 
underground but I'm going to show you
how<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.160> above<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> ground<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.330> get

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
how to do it above the ground so you get

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.839 
how to do it above the ground so you get
the<00:00:12.690> idea<00:00:12.750> not<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> make<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.309> full<00:00:14.519> scale

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
the idea not going to make it full scale

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.150 
the idea not going to make it full scale
and<00:00:15.179> everything<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:16.320> I'm<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.890> give<00:00:17.010> you

and everything but I'm going to give you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.029 
and everything but I'm going to give you
the<00:00:17.279> idea<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> how<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> make<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.680> you

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the idea of how to make it so that you

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.220 
the idea of how to make it so that you
can<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.369> it

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
can do it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.349 
can do it
so<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:22.949> off<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.609> want<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> place<00:00:24.119> your

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so first off you just want to place your

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.220 
so first off you just want to place your
little<00:00:24.840> torch<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.119> place<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> Sun<00:00:27.449> black<00:00:27.689> block

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
little torch and place a Sun black block

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.549 
little torch and place a Sun black block
or<00:00:28.710> black<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.429> top<00:00:29.670> where<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:31.230> when<00:00:31.920> well

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
or black on top where you then when well

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.840 
or black on top where you then when well
normally<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.550> wall

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
normally it's going to be like a wall

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.840 
normally it's going to be like a wall
here<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.950> you're<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> place<00:00:38.610> any

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here so you're not going to place any

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.680 
here so you're not going to place any
torches<00:00:39.210> behind<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.420> just

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
torches behind this and then you just

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.229 
torches behind this and then you just
keep<00:00:42.930> building<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
keep building it up like this like that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.810 
keep building it up like this like that
and<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> wanna<00:00:46.379> place<00:00:46.680> more<00:00:46.950> torches<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
and you wanna place more torches and

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.020 
and you wanna place more torches and
build<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.000> even<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.820> keep

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
build it even more up and you just keep

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
build it even more up and you just keep
doing<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.629> basically<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.469> making<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
doing this basically and making it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.869 
doing this basically and making it
bigger<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> bigger<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> bigger<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:58.260> scale

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
bigger and bigger and bigger in scale

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
bigger and bigger and bigger in scale
until<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> covers<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.780> whole<00:01:00.809> area<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.620> want

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
until it covers the whole area you want

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.310 
until it covers the whole area you want
to<00:01:01.949> build<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:03.359> sorry<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.840> can't<00:01:04.140> be

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to build it on I'm sorry this can't be

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.740 
to build it on I'm sorry this can't be
built<00:01:04.589> unlimited<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.510> down

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
built unlimited because when you're down

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.370 
built unlimited because when you're down
the<00:01:06.960> bedrock<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:08.700> can't<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.450> further

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the bedrock you can't go any further

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
the bedrock you can't go any further
down<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> scale<00:01:14.340> stops<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
down and you know the scale stops there

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
down and you know the scale stops there
but<00:01:15.630> you're<00:01:15.869> never<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> build<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
but you're never going to build it that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.340 
but you're never going to build it that
big<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> take<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> days

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
big because it's going to take like days

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 
big because it's going to take like days
and<00:01:19.740> days<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> break<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and days and if you break one of the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
and days and if you break one of the
torches<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.140> whole<00:01:22.290> thing<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
torches the whole thing is going to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.950 
torches the whole thing is going to
collapse

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
collapse

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.340 
collapse
like<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.210 

and<00:01:33.120> you<00:01:34.120> built<00:01:34.360> that's<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.500> that's<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.130> whole

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and you built that's it that's the whole

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.510 
and you built that's it that's the whole
concept<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.150> this<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.740> may<00:01:38.890> be<00:01:38.920> asking<00:01:39.159> me

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
concept of this but you may be asking me

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.570 
concept of this but you may be asking me
how<00:01:39.729> did<00:01:39.940> I<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:41.110> did<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.320> make<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.770> thing<00:01:42.070> fall

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
how did I how did I make the thing fall

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.260 
how did I how did I make the thing fall
like<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:45.040> see<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.850> can<00:01:45.880> see<00:01:46.030> it's

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
like you can see it you can see it's

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.930 
like you can see it you can see it's
there<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.710> see<00:01:47.920> you're<00:01:48.369> standing<00:01:48.850> on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
there and you can see you're standing on

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.930 
there and you can see you're standing on
top<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:50.680> how<00:01:51.400> do<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.670> make<00:01:51.880> it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
top of it but how do you make it

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.260 
top of it but how do you make it
collapse<00:01:52.330> basically<00:01:53.050> what<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.470> did<00:01:53.530> was<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:55.030> had

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
collapse basically what I did was I had

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.370 
collapse basically what I did was I had
a<00:01:55.300> piston<00:01:55.840> with<00:01:57.180> oops<00:01:58.180> sorry<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:01.140> water<00:02:02.140> in

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
a piston with oops sorry with water in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.859 
a piston with oops sorry with water in
it<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:04.289> when<00:02:05.289> I<00:02:05.320> flicked<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.770> switch<00:02:05.800> this

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it and when I flicked the switch this

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.999 
it and when I flicked the switch this
thingamajigger<00:02:07.869> was<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.649> removed

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
thingamajigger was going to be removed

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.670 
thingamajigger was going to be removed
and<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> water<00:02:09.489> goes<00:02:09.880> down<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.470> removes<00:02:11.470> one

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and the water goes down and removes one

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.620 
and the water goes down and removes one
of<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> torches<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.030> whole<00:02:13.180> thing<00:02:13.480> is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
of the torches and the whole thing is

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.410 
of the torches and the whole thing is
going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.959> collapse<00:02:14.850> even<00:02:15.850> though<00:02:15.970> you're<00:02:16.239> not
