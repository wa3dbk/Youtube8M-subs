petroleum<00:00:26.160> color<00:00:26.400> covered<00:00:26.880> ones<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
petroleum color covered ones this is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.990 
petroleum color covered ones this is
something<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> pads<00:00:34.399> with<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> pads<00:00:35.790> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
something with the pads with the pads I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.650 
something with the pads with the pads I
like<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.500> actually<00:00:38.090> full<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
like to do is I actually full I like to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.930 
like to do is I actually full I like to
put<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> drop<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.559> fold<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
put the drop in and fold it over that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
put the drop in and fold it over that
makes<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.480> easier<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> comes<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.800> apply

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
makes it easier when it comes to apply

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.650 
makes it easier when it comes to apply
it<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> cotton<00:00:48.090> ball<00:00:48.270> strikes

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it but you think the cotton ball strikes

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:00.889 
it but you think the cotton ball strikes
easier<00:00:49.579> diesel<00:00:57.140> that'll<00:00:58.140> burn<00:00:58.260> also<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.899> just

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
easier diesel that'll burn also I just

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.039 
easier diesel that'll burn also I just
like<00:01:01.350> putting<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> makeup<00:01:02.789> pads<00:01:03.049> folding

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
like putting these a makeup pads folding

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it in half put anyway does it block and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.929 
it in half put anyway does it block and
also<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> same<00:01:08.760> thing<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.939> cotton
