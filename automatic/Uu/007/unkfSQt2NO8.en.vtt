there are only two integers and both are
known<00:01:54.909> they're<00:01:55.360> both<00:01:55.509> one<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.229> first<00:01:56.409> and

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
known they're both one the first and

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.770 
known they're both one the first and
last<00:01:56.770> both<00:01:57.430> one<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.180> nothing<00:01:58.479> needs<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.720> be

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
last both one so nothing needs to be

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.929 
last both one so nothing needs to be
done<00:01:58.869> for<00:01:59.289> step<00:01:59.470> two<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.610> we're<00:02:00.789> done<00:02:00.880> with

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
done for step two and we're done with

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.830 
done for step two and we're done with
the<00:02:01.090> second<00:02:01.450> row<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:02.619> Pascal's<00:02:03.070> triangle<00:02:03.840> okay

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
the second row of Pascal's triangle okay

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.889 
the second row of Pascal's triangle okay
so<00:02:04.899> we<00:02:05.670> repeat<00:02:06.670> step<00:02:07.000> two<00:02:07.180> way<00:02:07.299> again<00:02:07.600> we're

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
so we repeat step two way again we're

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.419 
so we repeat step two way again we're
going<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.110> create<00:02:08.259> another<00:02:08.319> rather<00:02:08.739> create<00:02:09.369> a

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
going to create another rather create a

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.889 
going to create another rather create a
new<00:02:09.580> row<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.789> integers<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.600> number<00:02:10.810> of

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
new row of integers the number of

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.420 
new row of integers the number of
integers<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.440> new<00:02:11.590> row<00:02:11.769> will<00:02:11.950> be<00:02:12.069> one<00:02:12.250> more

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
integers in the new row will be one more

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.860 
integers in the new row will be one more
than<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.910> number<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.180> integers<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.720> row

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
than the number of integers in the row

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.870 
than the number of integers in the row
above<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.260> throw<00:02:14.830> above<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.190> has<00:02:15.310> two<00:02:15.549> numbers

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
above it throw above it has two numbers

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.789 
above it throw above it has two numbers
two<00:02:16.239> integers<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.290> way<00:02:17.470> we'll<00:02:17.650> have

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
two integers so this way we'll have

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.300 
two integers so this way we'll have
three<00:02:18.190> integers<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.380> first<00:02:20.590> Center<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
three integers the first Center and the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.949 
three integers the first Center and the
last<00:02:21.489> signature<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.180> new<00:02:22.330> row<00:02:22.480> are<00:02:22.750> both

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
last signature in the new row are both

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.110 
last signature in the new row are both
one<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.739> we<00:02:23.830> assign<00:02:24.040> one<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.400> those<00:02:24.519> now<00:02:25.060> we

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
one so we assign one of those now we

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.640 
one so we assign one of those now we
have<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.540> unknown<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.230> middle

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
have one unknown in the middle

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.009 
have one unknown in the middle
fill<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.489> any<00:02:27.670> remaining<00:02:28.120> integers<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
fill in any remaining integers in the

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.380 
fill in any remaining integers in the
new<00:02:29.170> row<00:02:29.380> by<00:02:29.920> summing<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> two<00:02:30.640> integers<00:02:31.150> in

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
new row by summing the two integers in

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.539 
new row by summing the two integers in
the<00:02:31.450> row<00:02:31.720> above<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.440> lie<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.040> towards

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
the row above it that lie just towards

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.330 
the row above it that lie just towards
left<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.560> we<00:02:35.680> have<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.920> question

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
left and right so we have that question

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.190 
left and right so we have that question
mark<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.670> we<00:02:36.850> need<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.060> figure<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.660> what

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
mark there we need to figure it out what

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.410 
mark there we need to figure it out what
goes<00:02:38.380> there<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:39.730> we're<00:02:39.850> going<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.060> sum<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
goes there well we're going to sum the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.090 
goes there well we're going to sum the
two<00:02:40.600> numbers<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.200> above<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> row<00:02:41.829> above

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
two numbers just above in the row above

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.630 
two numbers just above in the row above
it<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.489> what's<00:02:42.910> left<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.299> right<00:02:43.480> 1<00:02:44.079> plus<00:02:44.350> 1

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it just what's left and right 1 plus 1

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.690 
it just what's left and right 1 plus 1
which<00:02:45.640> equals<00:02:45.670> 2<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.930> 2<00:02:46.989> goes<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.650> slot<00:02:48.160> in

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
which equals 2 so 2 goes in that slot in

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.660 
which equals 2 so 2 goes in that slot in
Pascal's<00:02:49.420> triangle<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:51.220> we're<00:02:51.370> done<00:02:51.459> with<00:02:51.609> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
Pascal's triangle so we're done with the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.270 
Pascal's triangle so we're done with the
third<00:02:51.880> row<00:02:51.989> we're<00:02:52.989> going<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> fourth<00:02:53.590> row<00:02:53.799> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
third row we're going to a fourth row so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.789 
third row we're going to a fourth row so
we<00:02:54.489> go<00:02:54.790> back<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:55.000> 2a<00:02:55.299> again<00:02:55.750> create<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.470> new<00:02:56.620> row

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
we go back to 2a again create a new row

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.199 
we go back to 2a again create a new row
of<00:02:56.859> integers<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.459> number<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.760> integers<00:02:57.940> in

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
of integers the number of integers in

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.490 
of integers the number of integers in
the<00:02:58.299> new<00:02:58.420> row<00:02:58.600> will<00:02:58.750> be<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.019> more<00:02:59.170> than<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the new row will be one more than the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.690 
the new row will be one more than the
number<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.709> integers<00:03:00.100> in<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.310> row<00:03:00.459> above<00:03:00.489> it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
number of integers in the row above it

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.759 
number of integers in the row above it
we<00:03:01.269> had<00:03:01.390> 300<00:03:01.810> roots<00:03:01.930> in<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.109> row<00:03:02.230> above<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.470> so

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
we had 300 roots in the row above it so

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.280 
we had 300 roots in the row above it so
we<00:03:02.859> have<00:03:02.980> four<00:03:03.220> integers<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.790> row<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
we have four integers in this row the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.870 
we have four integers in this row the
first<00:03:05.530> integer<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.160> last<00:03:06.370> major<00:03:06.579> in<00:03:06.820> a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
first integer and the last major in a

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.900 
first integer and the last major in a
new<00:03:07.060> row<00:03:07.209> are<00:03:07.450> both<00:03:07.600> one<00:03:08.519> fill<00:03:09.519> in<00:03:09.670> and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
new row are both one fill in and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.490 
new row are both one fill in and
remaining<00:03:10.239> integers<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.900> new<00:03:11.079> row<00:03:11.260> by

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
remaining integers in the new row by

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.960 
remaining integers in the new row by
summing<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.920> two<00:03:12.100> integers<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.820> row

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
summing the two integers and the row

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.390 
summing the two integers and the row
above<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.660> lie<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.709> its<00:03:14.829> left<00:03:15.100> and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
above it that lie just to its left and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.520 
above it that lie just to its left and
right<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.329> we<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.660> red<00:03:16.900> question<00:03:17.380> where

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
right so we have that red question where

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.860 
right so we have that red question where
what<00:03:17.799> goes<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.370> slot

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
what goes in that slot

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.150 
what goes in that slot
well<00:03:20.440> we're<00:03:20.560> going<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.769> sum<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:20.980> two

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
well we're going to sum of the two

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.860 
well we're going to sum of the two
numbers<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.700> row<00:03:21.879> above<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.450> what's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
numbers in the row above it just what's

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.750 
numbers in the row above it just what's
left<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.260> right<00:03:23.379> so<00:03:23.890> one<00:03:24.069> plus<00:03:24.250> one<00:03:24.430> equals

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
left and right so one plus one equals

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.930 
left and right so one plus one equals
well<00:03:25.239> three<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.739> slot<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.250> filled<00:03:27.640> that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
well three so that slot is filled that

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.460 
well three so that slot is filled that
question<00:03:28.360> mark<00:03:28.540> now<00:03:29.080> we<00:03:29.170> have<00:03:29.260> another

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
question mark now we have another

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.380 
question mark now we have another
question<00:03:29.709> mark<00:03:30.099> what<00:03:30.580> energy<00:03:30.940> goes<00:03:31.120> there

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
question mark what energy goes there

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.360 
question mark what energy goes there
same<00:03:32.290> thing<00:03:32.319> we're<00:03:32.769> gonna<00:03:32.890> add<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.220> two

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
same thing we're gonna add the two

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.979 
same thing we're gonna add the two
numbers<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.060> right<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.480> above<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.840> just

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
numbers in the right just above it just

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.360 
numbers in the right just above it just
what's<00:03:35.440> left<00:03:35.680> that's<00:03:35.830> right

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
what's left that's right

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.360 
what's left that's right
two<00:03:36.760> plus<00:03:36.879> one<00:03:37.000> equals<00:03:37.720> three<00:03:38.099> now<00:03:39.099> we're<00:03:39.250> done

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
two plus one equals three now we're done

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.920 
two plus one equals three now we're done
with<00:03:39.430> fourth<00:03:39.760> row<00:03:40.000> we're<00:03:40.569> going<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.780> add<00:03:40.900> a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
with fourth row we're going to add a

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.610 
with fourth row we're going to add a
fifth<00:03:41.170> row

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
fifth row

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.430 
fifth row
so<00:03:42.549> again<00:03:42.910> create<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> new<00:03:43.810> row<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:43.989> integers

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
so again create a new row of integers

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.960 
so again create a new row of integers
the<00:03:44.860> number<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.129> integers<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.640> new<00:03:45.819> row

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
the number of integers in the new row

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.430 
the number of integers in the new row
will<00:03:46.180> be<00:03:46.299> one<00:03:46.450> more<00:03:46.629> than<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.140> number<00:03:47.200> of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
will be one more than the number of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.470 
will be one more than the number of
integers<00:03:47.769> in<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.920> row<00:03:48.069> above<00:03:48.099> we<00:03:49.000> had<00:03:49.120> four<00:03:49.360> in

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
integers in the row above we had four in

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.789 
integers in the row above we had four in
the<00:03:49.540> robe<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.170> we<00:03:50.260> have<00:03:50.379> five<00:03:50.560> integers

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
the robe of it so we have five integers

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.150 
the robe of it so we have five integers
in<00:03:51.099> this<00:03:51.220> row<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.380> first<00:03:53.590> senator<00:03:53.980> and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
in this row to be the first senator and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.860 
in this row to be the first senator and
the<00:03:54.340> lesson<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.760> during<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.090> new<00:03:55.209> row<00:03:55.390> or<00:03:55.690> both

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
the lesson of during the new row or both

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.580 
the lesson of during the new row or both
one<00:03:56.170> easy<00:03:56.799> enough<00:03:57.900> fill<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.049> any<00:03:59.170> remaining

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
one easy enough fill in any remaining

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.380 
one easy enough fill in any remaining
integers<00:04:00.040> in<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.250> new<00:04:00.459> row<00:04:00.640> by<00:04:00.970> summing<00:04:01.299> to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
integers in the new row by summing to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.000 
integers in the new row by summing to
two<00:04:01.540> integers<00:04:01.959> in<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.170> row<00:04:02.319> above<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.739> that

through all the steps but okay we had

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.850 
through all the steps but okay we had
question<00:04:52.419> mark<00:04:52.599> there<00:04:52.750> where<00:04:52.930> five<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.139> well

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
question mark there where five is well

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.140 
question mark there where five is well
one<00:04:54.039> plus<00:04:54.250> four<00:04:54.430> equals<00:04:54.729> five

four plus one equals five
and<00:05:05.220> we're<00:05:06.220> done<00:05:06.370> with<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.580> sixth<00:05:06.940> row<00:05:07.289> we're

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
and we're done with a sixth row we're

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.260 
and we're done with a sixth row we're
going<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.530> add<00:05:08.590> another<00:05:08.710> row<00:05:09.120> create<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.150> new

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
going to add another row create a new

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.180 
going to add another row create a new
row<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.810> integers<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.500> number<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.830> integers

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
row of integers the number of integers

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.770 
row of integers the number of integers
in<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.370> new

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
in the new

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.000 
in the new
we'll<00:05:12.870> be<00:05:12.960> one<00:05:13.139> more<00:05:13.320> than<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.740> number<00:05:13.950> of

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
we'll be one more than the number of

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.790 
we'll be one more than the number of
integers<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.700> robe<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.960> last<00:05:16.110> row<00:05:16.470> had

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
integers and robe of it the last row had

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.010 
integers and robe of it the last row had
six<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.760> row<00:05:17.940> will<00:05:18.120> have<00:05:18.150> seven<00:05:18.630> integers

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
six so this row will have seven integers

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
but if you created an eighth row they

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.060 
but if you created an eighth row they
would<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.780> would<00:05:45.990> be<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.320> if<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:46.800> create<00:05:46.980> a
