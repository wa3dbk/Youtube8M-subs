00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.150
 Hello everyone, I decided to make a video by 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.610
 replacing cabin filter with geely emgrand 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:21.359
 ec7 here I got a filter today 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:23.180
 the store is not the original analog but there 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.510
 is written 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:34.739
 cabin air filter 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 china cada vez que said he replaces yes 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:44.610
 and we change burned even came to him 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.480
 traumatic grandee and with him his 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.010
 restored said fit perfect 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.010
 Now Matrix is â€‹â€‹a matter of faith 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.680
 Salon is us for glove 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.399
 a crate 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.850
 that's what we need to do we need 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.850
 remove this drawer remove the side cover 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.189
 the cap will be much to remove 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:22.039
 he gets 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:26.189
 cassette filters and just changes it 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:28.829
 I will show how to do what I was looking for. 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.729
 it's time to clean up the internet 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.520
 filter of numbers and probably 5 times since 2013 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.689
 years the car and looked on the Internet as 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.710
 this whole thing is changing did not find anything 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.920
 just recently an example 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.909
 I found pictures of you to the club grant 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.509
 my only one there 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.250
 after all, he does not lead a photo like this 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.380
 replacing this is still an incomplete account 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.750
 the system is different to that showed whale these 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.539
 stubs there is some other mechanism 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.929
 incomprehensible I also did not present only 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.869
 here 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.689
 I had a problem change it is not 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.610
 problem i knew that angel he is 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:14.099
 here's how to remove the microlift mechanism here 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.049
 lifter there and when pulls down 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:22.470
 there is still a glove on yourself 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.829
 this mechanism is how to remove it from yourself 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.069
 glove box but I thought it thought thought thought 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.829
 wondered did try to make them guess 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.269
 somehow twisted it the first time 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:40.139
 I was cleaning the filter rather, and then 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.260
 when I removed the side cap I saw 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.889
 there is such a small fixture now I 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.889
 I 'll show it to you 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.840
 you just had to find a mechanism for it 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.730
 he removed easily 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.730
 so let 's get started 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.720
 sat down so sound not skinny prolazit 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.720
 easy 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.590
 squeeze the cap and on the photo by the way he 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.690
 it was obvious that he was shooting the seal 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.220
 I will not do this but do not need to shoot 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.220
 and just pull over 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.790
 very easy to remove 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.790
 at 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.240
 Iâ€™ll try to show now I donâ€™t know 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.310
 you can not see the mechanism of the microlift 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.310
 here he is
