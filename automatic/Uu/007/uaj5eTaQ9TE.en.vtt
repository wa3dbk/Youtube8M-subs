on<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:07.420> part<00:03:07.750> that's<00:03:07.959> sticking<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
on this part that's sticking out and the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.690 

when<00:03:15.960> cubed<00:03:16.350> on<00:03:16.530> these<00:03:16.800> sites<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.340> French

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
when cubed on these sites and French

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.510 
when cubed on these sites and French
speaks<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:19.170> want<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.470> print<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.980> ends<00:03:20.340> as

speaks you want to print the ends as

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:30.230 
speaks you want to print the ends as
well<00:03:20.790> from<00:03:21.720> both<00:03:22.020> sides

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.720 

once<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.110> have<00:03:31.140> these<00:03:31.560> fringed<00:03:32.190> you're<00:03:32.490> going

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
once you have these fringed you're going

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.330 
once you have these fringed you're going
to<00:03:32.790> take<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.060> square<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.140> you're<00:03:34.920> going<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
to take your square and you're going to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.760 
to take your square and you're going to
open<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.820> up<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.000> laid<00:03:36.390> out<00:03:36.570> for

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.480 

this<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.550> pretty<00:03:41.790> much<00:03:41.940> what<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.270> should<00:03:42.630> have

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
this is pretty much what you should have

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.770 
this is pretty much what you should have
you<00:03:44.490> should<00:03:44.520> have<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.850> missing<00:03:45.150> part<00:03:45.510> right

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
you should have a missing part right

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.620 
you should have a missing part right
here<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.350> right<00:03:46.530> here<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:48.000> keep<00:03:48.360> these

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
here and right here and keep these

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.240 
here and right here and keep these
because<00:03:49.170> these<00:03:49.350> are<00:03:49.560> going<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.740> come<00:03:49.890> in<00:03:50.010> handy

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
because these are going to come in handy

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.080 
because these are going to come in handy
for<00:03:50.400> using<00:03:52.070> times<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.460> should<00:03:56.490> have<00:03:56.820> four

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
for using times and you should have four

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.090 
for using times and you should have four
pieces<00:03:57.300> missing<00:03:58.430> one<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.580> each<00:03:59.700> corner<00:04:04.100> this

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
pieces missing one in each corner this

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.010 
pieces missing one in each corner this
point<00:04:05.430> what<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.700> want<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.720> want<00:04:06.840> to

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
point what you want to do is you want to

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.500 
point what you want to do is you want to
take<00:04:07.200> your<00:04:07.350> square<00:04:08.210> and<00:04:09.210> you're<00:04:09.330> going<00:04:09.450> to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
take your square and you're going to

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.810 
take your square and you're going to
tuck<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.960> edges<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.970> just<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.180> them

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.620 

and<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.940> can<00:04:20.120> start<00:04:20.480> tying<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:22.790> inside

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.980 

but<00:04:28.200> together<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.360> since<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.480> may<00:04:30.630> pick<00:04:30.810> up

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
but together and since you may pick up

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.710 
but together and since you may pick up
at<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.860> same<00:04:32.040> time<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.430> have<00:04:32.630> exactly<00:04:33.630> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
at the same time you have exactly the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.120 
at the same time you have exactly the
same<00:04:33.870> number<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.410> cuts<00:04:34.740> on<00:04:34.980> both<00:04:35.250> sides<00:04:35.580> and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
same number of cuts on both sides and

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.680 
same number of cuts on both sides and
you<00:04:38.130> can<00:04:38.280> insert<00:04:38.550> tying<00:04:38.850> your<00:04:39.060> fringe<00:04:39.330> make

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
you can insert tying your fringe make

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.320 
you can insert tying your fringe make
sure<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.110> start<00:04:40.410> on<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.770> outside<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.730> the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
sure to start on the outside and the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.210 
sure to start on the outside and the
reason<00:04:42.720> for<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.350> because<00:04:43.380> if<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.980> start

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
reason for this is because if you start

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.750 
reason for this is because if you start
coming<00:04:44.700> from<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.060> inside<00:04:45.480> as<00:04:45.750> you<00:04:46.590> tie<00:04:46.830> you're

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
coming from the inside as you tie you're

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.690 
coming from the inside as you tie you're
not<00:04:47.940> going<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.180> notice<00:04:48.390> when<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.990> stop<00:04:49.700> so

not going to notice when to stop so

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.540 
not going to notice when to stop so
start<00:04:51.180> telling<00:04:51.510> them<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.930> outside<00:04:52.550> tie

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
start telling them on the outside tie

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.270 
start telling them on the outside tie
these<00:04:53.610> together<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:55.350> knees<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.800> the
