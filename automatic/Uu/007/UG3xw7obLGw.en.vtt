00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.339
 current socket 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
 this is his main screen 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.189
 is 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.029
 let's start ahahah see one of the first because of this comment 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.170
 puppies so singly 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.960
 brocon unit 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.150
 14 below 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.570
 below the screen 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.640
 for 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.820
 as for the line it is usually displayed 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 a nice jet to make us 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.960
 to see 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.970
 for how many twitters 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.210
 if we don't have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.130
 or 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.260
 we miss them from reading from the last quite bed 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.250
 in this case we will have no berger so don't go 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.470
 we won't know how many tweets we should read our lines 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.530
 but a gray bar will appear pooh 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.540
 up 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.740
 we end up being also quick to try to understand 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 how many twitters we will have to read 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240
 the only thing that 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.060
 makes us understand 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.060
 in which we are close to the conclusion 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.420
 discover see here there is a black vat bar 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.050
 which indicates 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.100
 how much is missing at the end 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 of the page 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.410
 so this is his screen anyway 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.920
 main 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.430

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.669
 let's look at the settings instead with regards to this 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.830
 application we will simply have to 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.709

 there is the possibility of managing more than one house. 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.409

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.610
 here at the bottom right we will have the settings button 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.659
 simple settings we will have only two themes 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.459

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.749
 the date format 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:32.670

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.370
 but we will have the possibility to activate it only 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.749

 of the peculiarities of this application sound the driver 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.069
