 with broadway the riding the songs was 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.280
 very funny because it was something like this very 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.160

 In Tabasco the public is fabulous and 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.700

 is what we are transmitting loyal to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.310
 the people of tabasco and I think that the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.430

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.920
