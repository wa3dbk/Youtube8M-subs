00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.030
 how are friends and friends we are in the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.120
 chapter number 12 for which I have 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.040
 reserved something very important the handling 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.730
 of light as we said in the chapter 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.590
 number one photographs write with light 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.080
 I as a videographer usually 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.020
 work with constant lights 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.970
 these are cold lights lamps without 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.450
 However there are photographers who prefer 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.120
 work with flash and others that use light 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.790
 combined constant lights with flashes 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.170
 I personally work only with light 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.360
 constant 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.760
 I want to tell him and I will go talking to him 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.820
 while the effects are seen I have two 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.160
 lights in front a principal in my 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 and a secondary angle here here that 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.590
 flame fill light and a light that I have 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.990
 in the back that is the part that 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.870
 give me a line with the background in English of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.550
 amman backlight I'm going to turn off the 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.920
 lights for you to see the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.580
 effects that these cause in me we are going to 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.580
 see this example 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.500

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.600
