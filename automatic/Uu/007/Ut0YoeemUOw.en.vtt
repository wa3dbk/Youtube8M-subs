00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.689 

because<00:00:19.230> paper<00:00:19.529> tear<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.039> easily<00:00:20.520> you're

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
because paper tear is easily you're

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.310 
because paper tear is easily you're
going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> need<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> face<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.779> glue<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> paper

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
going to need a face to glue the paper

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.200 
going to need a face to glue the paper
onto<00:00:23.689> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.820> to<00:00:26.820> create

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
onto this is what I use now to create

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.339 
onto this is what I use now to create
the<00:00:27.449> pop-tart<00:00:29.390> start<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> piece<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.109> black

anything<00:00:55.180> close<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:59.260> cut<00:00:59.559> off<00:00:59.710> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
anything close to that then cut off the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
anything close to that then cut off the
second<00:01:00.370> stair<00:01:00.640> step<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.879> create<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.940> sliver

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
second stair step and create a sliver

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.130 
second stair step and create a sliver
when<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.000> paste<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.390> on<00:01:07.509> this<00:01:07.690> is<00:01:07.840> what<00:01:08.020> it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
when you paste it on this is what it

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:19.250 
when you paste it on this is what it
should<00:01:08.170> look<00:01:08.350> like

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.990 

the<00:01:20.260> frosting<00:01:20.650> was<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:20.860> little<00:01:21.310> tricky<00:01:21.610> but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the frosting was a little tricky but

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.480 
the frosting was a little tricky but
it's<00:01:22.180> not<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.600> hard

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it's not that hard

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.070
