00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
pensions were something that a lot of

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.760 
pensions were something that a lot of
advanced<00:00:21.460> lead<00:00:21.850> guitar<00:00:22.180> players<00:00:22.450> use<00:00:22.770> but

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
advanced lead guitar players use but

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.050 
advanced lead guitar players use but
even<00:00:23.980> if<00:00:24.070> you're<00:00:24.160> not<00:00:24.250> that<00:00:24.310> advanced<00:00:24.849> you<00:00:25.000> can

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
even if you're not that advanced you can

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.210 
even if you're not that advanced you can
use<00:00:25.300> them<00:00:25.450> too<00:00:25.630> they're<00:00:26.470> not<00:00:26.619> that<00:00:26.740> hard<00:00:27.009> and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
use them too they're not that hard and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.790 
use them too they're not that hard and
they're<00:00:27.460> very<00:00:27.730> effective<00:00:28.270> very<00:00:28.450> musical<00:00:29.080> so

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
they're very effective very musical so

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.310 
they're very effective very musical so
first<00:00:30.009> of<00:00:30.130> all<00:00:30.189> what<00:00:30.609> is<00:00:30.760> an<00:00:30.880> arpeggio<00:00:31.359> an

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
first of all what is an arpeggio an

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.950 
first of all what is an arpeggio an
arpeggio<00:00:32.830> is<00:00:33.129> the<00:00:33.879> notes<00:00:34.120> of<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.300> chord<00:00:34.330> played

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
arpeggio is the notes of a chord played

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.330 
arpeggio is the notes of a chord played
separately<00:00:35.260> that's<00:00:35.769> all<00:00:35.949> it<00:00:36.040> is

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
separately that's all it is

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.470 
separately that's all it is
so<00:00:36.550> for<00:00:36.699> example<00:00:37.059> a<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:38.640> major<00:00:39.640> chord<00:00:39.970> has<00:00:40.300> to

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
so for example a a major chord has to

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.900 
so for example a a major chord has to
know<00:00:40.570> it's<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.809> C<00:00:41.440> sharp<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.800> E<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:42.610> if<00:00:42.670> you<00:00:42.730> play

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
know it's a C sharp and E so if you play

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.190 
know it's a C sharp and E so if you play
those<00:00:43.090> one<00:00:43.300> at<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.449> time<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:49.719> all<00:00:50.079> an

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
those one at a time that's all an

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.560 
those one at a time that's all an
arpeggio<00:00:50.680> is<00:00:50.860> it's<00:00:51.190> very<00:00:51.460> simple<00:00:51.820> right

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.779 

alright<00:00:58.570> now<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:59.079> want<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.010> stress<00:01:00.250> something

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
alright now I want to stress something

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.910 
alright now I want to stress something
and<00:01:01.030> that's<00:01:01.210> an<00:01:01.449> arpeggio<00:01:01.960> by<00:01:02.199> itself<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.860> not

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
and that's an arpeggio by itself is not

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.480 
and that's an arpeggio by itself is not
music<00:01:03.699> just<00:01:04.119> like<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> scale<00:01:04.629> by<00:01:04.899> itself<00:01:05.199> is

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
music just like a scale by itself is

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.580 
music just like a scale by itself is
just<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.610> scale<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.119> just<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.360> tool<00:01:07.630> same<00:01:08.470> with

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
just a scale it's just a tool same with

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.430 
just a scale it's just a tool same with
an<00:01:08.680> arpeggio<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.910> can<00:01:10.090> use<00:01:10.330> our<00:01:10.509> pay<00:01:10.660> Geo's<00:01:11.020> in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
an arpeggio you can use our pay Geo's in

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.020 
an arpeggio you can use our pay Geo's in
a<00:01:11.649> number<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:11.950> ways<00:01:12.039> such<00:01:12.399> as<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.850> know<00:01:12.940> you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
a number of ways such as you know you

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.300 
a number of ways such as you know you
can<00:01:13.119> write<00:01:13.270> licks<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:14.259> write<00:01:14.500> riffs<00:01:14.710> parts<00:01:15.190> of

a lot of different cool effects okay so
what<00:01:33.399> can<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.580> do<00:01:33.700> with<00:01:33.819> arpeggios<00:01:34.380> let<00:01:35.380> me

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
what can you do with arpeggios let me

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.930 
what can you do with arpeggios let me
start<00:01:35.709> you<00:01:35.740> off<00:01:35.890> with<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:36.220> simple<00:01:36.700> exercise

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
start you off with a simple exercise

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.020 
start you off with a simple exercise
which<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.959> simply<00:01:38.319> to<00:01:38.560> learn<00:01:38.740> all<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.580> notes

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
which is simply to learn all the notes

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.199 
which is simply to learn all the notes
of<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.360> chord<00:01:40.390> every<00:01:40.810> where<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.200> neck<00:01:41.380> so

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
of a chord every where in the neck so

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.580 
of a chord every where in the neck so
it's<00:01:43.209> actually<00:01:43.420> not<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:43.810> hard

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
it's actually not that hard

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.979 
it's actually not that hard
let's<00:01:45.039> let's<00:01:45.399> take<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.759> major<00:01:45.970> which<00:01:46.539> has<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.929> C

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:46.989 
let's let's take a major which has a C

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.499 
let's let's take a major which has a C
sharp<00:01:47.200> indeed<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:48.520> can<00:01:48.640> start<00:01:48.910> for<00:01:49.090> example

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
sharp indeed you can start for example

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.609 
sharp indeed you can start for example
on<00:01:49.569> your<00:01:49.720> second<00:01:50.110> fret<00:01:50.289> of<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.410> g<00:01:50.590> string

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
on your second fret of the g string

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.999 
on your second fret of the g string
which<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.009> 4a<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.289> next<00:01:53.470> note<00:01:53.649> will<00:01:53.739> be<00:01:53.830> C

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
which is 4a so the next note will be C

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.419 
which is 4a so the next note will be C
sharp<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.700> play<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.030> either<00:01:55.209> here<00:01:56.429> which

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
sharp you can play it either here which

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.339 
sharp you can play it either here which
is<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.700> same<00:01:57.910> string<00:01:58.270> but<00:01:58.840> higher<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
is the same string but higher up the

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.419 
is the same string but higher up the
frets<00:01:59.590> or<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:01.149> play<00:02:01.330> here<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.399> just

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
frets or you play here which is just

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.279 
frets or you play here which is just
basically<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.780> higher<00:02:05.349> string<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.899> let's<00:02:07.989> say

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
basically the higher string so let's say

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.940 
basically the higher string so let's say
I<00:02:08.319> play<00:02:08.770> this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
I play this

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.920 
I play this
now<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> next<00:02:11.910> note<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> chord<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> an<00:02:12.660> e

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
now the next note of the chord is an e

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.040 
now the next note of the chord is an e
again<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.709> play<00:02:13.860> either<00:02:14.130> higher<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.550> here

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
again I can play either higher up here

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.979 
again I can play either higher up here
or<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.470> go<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> next<00:02:16.800> ring

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.510 

so<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.860> learned<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.190> you'll<00:02:23.370> learn<00:02:23.459> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
so as you learned that you'll learn a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.210 
so as you learned that you'll learn a
lot<00:02:23.640> about<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.000> fret<00:02:24.209> board<00:02:24.239> for<00:02:24.989> example<00:02:25.220> if

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
lot about the fret board for example if

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.309 
lot about the fret board for example if
you<00:02:26.370> take<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.730> shape<00:02:28.550> which<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.989> D

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
you take this shape which is just the D

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.920 
you take this shape which is just the D
G<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.650> B<00:02:31.800> strings<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> use<00:02:36.090> those<00:02:36.330> three

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
G and B strings and you use those three

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.140 
G and B strings and you use those three
strings<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.130> go<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.550> neck<00:02:39.000> like

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
strings it you can go up the neck like

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.520 
strings it you can go up the neck like
this<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.750> you're<00:02:45.959> gonna<00:02:46.050> be<00:02:46.140> learning

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
this so you're gonna be learning

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.460 
this so you're gonna be learning
actually<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.069> shapes<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> these<00:02:47.760> chords<00:02:48.209> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.990 

the<00:02:52.470> arpeggios<00:02:52.920> at<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.130> same<00:02:53.310> time<00:02:53.519> kind<00:02:53.910> of

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
the arpeggios at the same time kind of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.259 
the arpeggios at the same time kind of
killing<00:02:54.299> two<00:02:54.390> birds<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.900> stone<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:56.269> it's

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
killing two birds with one stone so it's

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.940 
killing two birds with one stone so it's
better<00:02:57.420> for<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.780> explore<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.260> figure<00:02:58.920> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
better for you to explore and figure it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.840 
better for you to explore and figure it
out<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.160> your<00:02:59.370> own

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
out on your own

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.610 
out on your own
you'll<00:03:00.239> get<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.600> like<00:03:00.780> deeper<00:03:01.290> within

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
you'll get it like deeper within

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.890 
you'll get it like deeper within
yourself<00:03:02.180> rather<00:03:03.180> than<00:03:03.330> if<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:03.540> showed

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
yourself rather than if I just showed

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.449 
yourself rather than if I just showed
you<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.049> bunch<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.319> shapes<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.830> go<00:03:05.280> ahead<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you a bunch of shapes so go ahead and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.430 
you a bunch of shapes so go ahead and
experiment<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:07.019> actually<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> lot

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
experiment with that it's actually a lot

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.430 
experiment with that it's actually a lot
of<00:03:07.470> fun<00:03:08.090> alright<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.390> next<00:03:09.420> thing<00:03:09.630> let's

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
of fun alright so the next thing let's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.600 
of fun alright so the next thing let's
talk<00:03:10.590> about<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.920> particular<00:03:11.160> shape<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:13.769> mean

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
talk about this particular shape I mean

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.069 
talk about this particular shape I mean
there's<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:14.880> many<00:03:14.970> shapes<00:03:15.359> but<00:03:15.600> let's<00:03:15.930> just

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
there's so many shapes but let's just

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.870 
there's so many shapes but let's just
learn<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.410> one<00:03:16.590> for<00:03:16.769> starters<00:03:17.160> middle

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
fret of the g string even I remember

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.750 
fret of the g string even I remember
playing<00:03:31.799> one<00:03:32.010> at<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.160> time

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
playing one at a time

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.670 
playing one at a time
and<00:03:35.459> really<00:03:36.459> try<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.640> get<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.909> tonality<00:03:37.680> down

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
and really try to get the tonality down

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.930 
and really try to get the tonality down
into<00:03:38.980> your<00:03:39.069> fingers<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.459> what<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.610> mean<00:03:39.790> by

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
into your fingers and what I mean by

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.869 
into your fingers and what I mean by
that<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:41.290> know<00:03:41.379> if<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.590> had<00:03:41.769> let's<00:03:42.760> say<00:03:42.819> a

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
that is you know if I had let's say a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.530 
that is you know if I had let's say a
scale<00:03:43.209> like<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.720> minute<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.590> mean<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.360> can

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
scale like a minute I mean and I can

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.539 
scale like a minute I mean and I can
play<00:03:46.720> around<00:03:46.840> at<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.230> scale<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.830> wherever<00:03:48.370> I

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
play around at this scale go wherever I

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.570 
play around at this scale go wherever I
want<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.780> my<00:03:53.140> ear<00:03:53.410> wants<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.799> land<00:03:54.010> me<00:03:54.190> back<00:03:54.370> on

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
want but my ear wants to land me back on

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:04.350 
want but my ear wants to land me back on
that<00:03:54.610> route<00:04:02.220> okay<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:04.090> it's<00:04:04.209> got<00:04:04.299> that

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
that route okay so it's got that

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.600 
that route okay so it's got that
tonality<00:04:04.720> same<00:04:05.500> thing<00:04:05.680> with<00:04:05.829> like<00:04:05.860> major

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
tonality same thing with like major

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.770 
tonality same thing with like major
scale<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:12.730> got<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:12.879> certain<00:04:13.000> sound<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.629> it

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
scale it's got a certain sound to it

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.349 
scale it's got a certain sound to it
that's<00:04:14.140> time<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.829> root<00:04:15.010> within<00:04:15.849> our<00:04:16.000> patio

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that's time to the root within our patio

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.849 
that's time to the root within our patio
it's<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.600> same<00:04:16.780> thing<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.320> like<00:04:17.410> think<00:04:17.829> of

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
it's the same thing it's like think of

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.439 
it's the same thing it's like think of
it<00:04:17.919> as<00:04:18.039> almost<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.489> three<00:04:18.669> note<00:04:18.820> scale<00:04:24.449> I

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
it as almost like a three note scale I

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.860 
it as almost like a three note scale I
just<00:04:26.199> hit<00:04:26.289> an<00:04:26.380> extra<00:04:26.590> note

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.080 

so<00:04:33.870> get<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.800> sound<00:04:35.220> into<00:04:35.400> your<00:04:35.460> into<00:04:35.970> your

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so get that sound into your into your

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.930 
so get that sound into your into your
hands<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.480> fingers<00:04:37.220> some<00:04:38.220> real<00:04:38.400> simple<00:04:38.760> licks

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
hands and fingers some real simple licks

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.920 
hands and fingers some real simple licks
could<00:04:39.240> be<00:04:39.390> just<00:04:39.630> like<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:42.270> straight<00:04:42.630> up<00:04:42.780> your

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
could be just like just straight up your

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:57.630 
could be just like just straight up your
page<00:04:43.140> eo3<00:04:43.470> noise

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:11.840 

go<00:04:58.640> down<00:05:02.800> back<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.010> forth

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.300 

and<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:13.020> nice<00:05:13.500> thing<00:05:13.680> about<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:13.919> little<00:05:14.069> shape

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
and I nice thing about this little shape

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.450 
and I nice thing about this little shape
