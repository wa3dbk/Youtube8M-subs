00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.770
 you think it's a normal thing 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.809
 then swarm of indie two defeats 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.330
 diablo iii did not go down from the normal sky 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.699
 it can happen that who is this 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.989
 stoppix color let's say so a little 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:19.869
 leave a little 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.619
 a little fearful we say so but I think it's a normal thing csa badly 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.019
 so it was the fourteenth of the championship is not that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.839
 ok it's all over there 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.509
 is there now 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.609
 just one win is enough to give all this normality 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.850
 moment a little so maybe these two victories acts 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.100
 translated a little bit &amp; gt never dies 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.409
 abnormal look normal moments of difficulty there is 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.420
 however, it is not an emilio crisis I do not see any crisis 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.170
 frascati that ranks there is no crisis 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 let's play 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 ooh of Wednesday, Sunday to Thursday 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 may be thinner 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.769
 and the game only on Sundays jokes that it's easier 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.810
 we put the parma we didn't play that spoke to them prepared the match 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.920
 for good 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.829
 we are not open to preparing properly because we are playing Wednesday 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.330
 if he prepares a team 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660
 then I prepare another is not that 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.460
 it fascinates you but it is not so 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.530
 yes if we don't want to move forward we have to adapt this thing think 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.360
 nobody would complain in my opinion you are doing and lele 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.260
 the wrong questions that are beating me is doing a great championship there 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.010
 these questions do not exist 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.240
 you can lose how you can win we go to the field to always give the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.570
 maximum if they do so and they are champions and we are not one 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.130
 team that we are doing a great championship we have a very big one 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.550
 neovia tv date to reach we are in our midst goal we do not talk about 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.140
 scudetto because this word does not exist 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.580
 verissimo rods win so they are champions 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.650
 that we 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.050
 we try to go to their place but we see that our team is a 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.300
 large margins of improvement are never in Roman that the inter 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.780
 si palermo comes down from palermo in the field necklace comets in any difficulty 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.769
 team 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.969
 for that even we just have to play from Palermo we have to think about 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.209
 Rome either 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.290
 inter we have to think about our goal is to go champiosn 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.279
 in just that 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.189
 salas confiteor voted. 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.119
 + giuse 'cola del cagliari 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.139
 progeco bites thesis been lose is not that 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 that is, there is to be lost with the internet 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.239
 you understand if you are ferns can 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.629
 according to me the step is also a bit 'had been to cagliari face if 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.980
 does not arrive at the ninetieth we were dancing the game in questions we have 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.569
 lost 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.789
 one thing a 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.549
 but what to play with inter inter has a great team 'their movement 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.379
 beyond the episodes too 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.659
 normal 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.199
 I repeated Palermo plays death on playing from Palermo can put in 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.860
 difficulty passes as we were two weeks ago fimi input input 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.209
 classifies perhaps someone from annoyance that sa matessi maybe we had to be 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.529
 first 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.939
 I could do a little everyone 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.349
 fucking et 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.459
 but I say that we do the masses we do extraordinary championships we must instead 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.799
 she said instead of ibs 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.889
 not just us player malpensa that all the all the 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.429
 the fans to the company the coach all the players must be with you e 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.280
 of me fader text making an extraordinary championship 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.070
 here we say that we are the fourteenth of the championship mica the end so there is 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.569
 a whole championship from 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.999
 give back a whole championship also to suffer because 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.959
 no we do not say that from here the end we win all the games I hope that 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.019
 balls I can always do maximum as it is doing the moments though 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.949
 there is always difficulty and I do not know the palermo also everywhere also 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.799
 schools teams can from a match 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.260
 important because they are fine too 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.129
 however we have the advantages that play at home so we have to be den 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.209
 concentrated 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.449
 you make me do a great game I just hope to 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.539
 to do well this week and that on Saturday night we can 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.990
 give our fans our victory this is because it is 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.080
 Palermo deserves it
