00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
out to the Colorado what will you be

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.120 
out to the Colorado what will you be
program<00:06:08.090> if<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.450> like<00:06:08.740> well<00:06:09.740> we've<00:06:09.860> had<00:06:09.890> all

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
program if you like well we've had all

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.670 
program if you like well we've had all
our<00:06:10.310> scans<00:06:10.610> done<00:06:10.850> over<00:06:11.150> here<00:06:11.330> and<00:06:11.680> basically

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
our scans done over here and basically

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.270 
our scans done over here and basically
we're<00:06:13.550> thinking<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.240> mother<00:06:15.050> scans<00:06:15.710> say<00:06:16.010> that

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
we're thinking and mother scans say that

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.410 
we're thinking and mother scans say that
it's<00:06:16.630> it's<00:06:17.630> a<00:06:17.720> cruise<00:06:17.960> ship<00:06:21.130> lot<00:06:22.130> sir<00:06:22.420> rupture

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
it's it's a cruise ship lot sir rupture

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.380 
it's it's a cruise ship lot sir rupture
so<00:06:23.920> you<00:06:24.920> know<00:06:25.040> you<00:06:25.130> can't<00:06:25.310> see<00:06:25.550> makuch<00:06:26.030> on<00:06:26.210> the

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
so you know you can't see makuch on the

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.090 
so you know you can't see makuch on the
scan<00:06:26.600> so<00:06:26.810> it's<00:06:26.930> obviously<00:06:27.200> flowing<00:06:27.920> about

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
scan so it's obviously flowing about

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.920 
scan so it's obviously flowing about
something<00:06:28.400> moment<00:06:28.670> in<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.210> neighbor<00:06:29.420> apart

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
something moment in the neighbor apart

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.350 
something moment in the neighbor apart
from<00:06:30.050> that<00:06:30.350> then<00:06:30.860> was<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.490> minimal<00:06:32.150> damage

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
from that then was a minimal damage

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.810 
from that then was a minimal damage
really<00:06:32.870> there's<00:06:33.070> nothing<00:06:34.070> else<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:34.520> needs

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
really there's nothing else that needs

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.480 
really there's nothing else that needs
operating<00:06:35.330> on<00:06:35.420> which<00:06:35.600> is<00:06:35.780> a<00:06:35.810> big<00:06:36.290> bonus<00:06:36.530> not<00:06:37.340> so

operating on which is a big bonus not so

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.700 
operating on which is a big bonus not so
much<00:06:37.640> in<00:06:37.790> time<00:06:38.330> limits<00:06:38.750> but<00:06:38.930> just<00:06:39.290> in<00:06:39.410> coming

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
much in time limits but just in coming

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.380 
much in time limits but just in coming
back<00:06:39.860> then<00:06:40.100> you've<00:06:40.220> only<00:06:40.340> got<00:06:40.550> one<00:06:40.580> injury<00:06:41.240> to

sort<00:07:28.849> of<00:07:28.969> stuff<00:07:29.029> I<00:07:29.269> mean<00:07:29.419> it's<00:07:29.569> probably<00:07:29.839> too

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:30.289 
sort of stuff I mean it's probably too

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:32.499 
sort of stuff I mean it's probably too
soon<00:07:30.319> to<00:07:30.679> see<00:07:30.889> when<00:07:31.489> they<00:07:31.610> be<00:07:31.729> buckling<00:07:32.179> up<00:07:32.329> in

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:32.509 
soon to see when they be buckling up in

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:34.419 
soon to see when they be buckling up in
a<00:07:32.539> rough<00:07:32.749> estimate<00:07:33.229> when<00:07:33.409> when<00:07:34.129> would<00:07:34.309> you

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:34.429 
a rough estimate when when would you

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:35.949 
a rough estimate when when would you
ideally<00:07:34.879> like<00:07:34.999> the<00:07:35.239> button<00:07:35.719> of<00:07:35.809> lack<00:07:35.929> of

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:35.959 
ideally like the button of lack of

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:38.829 
ideally like the button of lack of
moisture<00:07:36.909> well<00:07:37.909> obviously<00:07:38.149> as<00:07:38.569> soon<00:07:38.719> as

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:38.839 
moisture well obviously as soon as

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:42.040 
moisture well obviously as soon as
possible<00:07:39.259> and<00:07:39.349> the<00:07:40.599> operation<00:07:41.599> needs<00:07:41.779> to<00:07:41.929> go

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
possible and the operation needs to go

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.769 
possible and the operation needs to go
according<00:07:42.619> to<00:07:42.829> plan<00:07:43.129> and<00:07:43.519> first<00:07:44.029> we'll<00:07:44.629> get

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:44.779 
according to plan and first we'll get

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.959 
according to plan and first we'll get
that<00:07:44.959> out<00:07:45.079> the<00:07:45.229> way<00:07:45.379> first<00:07:45.819> hopefully<00:07:46.819> that

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:46.969 
that out the way first hopefully that

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:49.119 
that out the way first hopefully that
that<00:07:47.329> goes<00:07:47.539> fine<00:07:47.809> and<00:07:48.079> then<00:07:48.169> we're<00:07:48.769> just<00:07:48.800> going

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:49.129 
that goes fine and then we're just going

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:50.979 
that goes fine and then we're just going
for<00:07:49.249> the<00:07:49.550> smooth<00:07:49.939> really<00:07:50.300> happen<00:07:50.629> if

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:50.989 
for the smooth really happen if

00:07:50.989 --> 00:07:55.329 
for the smooth really happen if
everything<00:07:51.499> goes<00:07:51.649> well<00:07:51.829> then<00:07:53.769> you<00:07:54.769> know<00:07:54.889> i'd

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:55.339 
everything goes well then you know i'd

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:57.850 
everything goes well then you know i'd
like<00:07:55.519> to<00:07:55.669> say<00:07:55.819> covered<00:07:56.209> play<00:07:56.809> soon<00:07:57.529> as
