00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.530
 for today I have a 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.980
 advice rather a beauty recipe 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.419
 Super practical and super easy is something that 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.719
 can do both men and women 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.420
 and we can take it everywhere is 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.550
 to refresh our skin and nourish the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.340
 because it's full of antioxidants this 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.780
 prevents aging of the skin and 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.940
 apart, it will keep us very 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.820
 refresh these right now that does so much 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.020
 hot but high is prescribing nothing more 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.020
 it's for women men 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.640
 in contrast if you have heat you want 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 cool off this recipe is going to be 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.030
 super useful we're going to need some 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.989
 atomizer containers 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 green 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.460
 purified water that is not the key and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.500
 ice 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.850
 Let's start by putting all the ice in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 our mass in this way 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.670
 we're going to put our tea bags 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.070
 green to the container 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.320
 the only thing I did was open the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 green tea packet and take away the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 liter that comes hanging 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.469
 ah 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.040
 since they are inside we are going to put the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.770
 water inside our container 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.829
 ah 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.829
 ah 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.079
 and now we are going to close it and we are going to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.079
 put in the refrigerator for two hours 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.360
 after two hours we will be left 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 something like this color 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.320
 is ready to put them in our 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.970
 containers let's help us from a funnel 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.970
 to not make a dump 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.380
 do not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.190
 and now the little one he always goes to 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.190
 bring in bag 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.610
 ready so we will stay 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.909
 I used to use similar products 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.890
 but the truth is that they left my face 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.260
 super dry and this product part of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.019
 be a thousand times cheaper leaves the face 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 super soft and very hydrated and now yes 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.670
 I'm leaving because I already have a super 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.610
 administrator 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.590
 the pure freshness of healing and now yes 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.350
 enjoy the heat and love but to the beach 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.120
 take it from work in the car in the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.120
 super rich traffic 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.340
 terrific work great super tactical 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.310
 super useful is good detail served this 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.390
 advice I hope I put it here 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.390
 the phrase of the day 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.820
 ah 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.070
 although they were close you can find 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.050
 send motivation on instagram and I'm 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.550

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.500

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.360
 description box as always I hope 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.670
 that with this guy it was easy so much heat 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.040
 or at least spend a little bit better 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.040

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.980
