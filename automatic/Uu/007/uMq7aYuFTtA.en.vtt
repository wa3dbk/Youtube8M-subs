you so nuke them down the first
possibility<00:01:41.640> wasn't<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> problem<00:01:42.299> only<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
possibility wasn't a problem only in the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.380 
possibility wasn't a problem only in the
fact<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.040> liked<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.520> dive<00:01:44.759> beneath<00:01:45.090> the
