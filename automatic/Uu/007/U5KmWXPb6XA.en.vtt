this would be for like all things on
trees<00:02:45.920> these<00:02:46.920> are<00:02:46.980> items<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.880> if<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.120> did<00:02:48.300> try<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
trees these are items so if I did try to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.690 
trees these are items so if I did try to
spawn<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:50.450> let's<00:02:51.450> say<00:02:55.340> something<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.610> you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
spawn a let's say something that you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.950 
spawn a let's say something that you
can't<00:02:56.970> place<00:02:57.350> or<00:02:58.350> doesn't<00:02:59.250> work<00:02:59.540> say<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> ladder

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
can't place or doesn't work say a ladder

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.840 
can't place or doesn't work say a ladder
if<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.770> put<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> fight<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.430> ooh<00:03:02.460> place<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> lot

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
if you put a fight right ooh place a lot

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.350 
if you put a fight right ooh place a lot
it<00:03:03.000> will<00:03:03.360> become<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:04.040> block<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.700> try<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.000> place

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
it will become a block if I try to place

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.900 
it will become a block if I try to place
a<00:03:06.630> snowball<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.650> would<00:03:07.770> become<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.310> sand<00:03:08.610> block

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
a snowball it would become a sand block

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.740 
a snowball it would become a sand block
that's<00:03:09.360> default<00:03:10.020> block<00:03:10.230> apparently<00:03:11.450> then<00:03:12.450> all

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that's default block apparently then all

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.570 
that's default block apparently then all
plants<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.410> would<00:03:13.530> assume<00:03:13.740> are<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.370> this

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
plants I would assume are be like this

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.910 
plants I would assume are be like this
so<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.540> run<00:03:15.690> through<00:03:15.900> every<00:03:16.350> single<00:03:16.740> one

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
so you can run through every single one

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.800 
so you can run through every single one
of<00:03:16.980> these<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:19.430> some<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.970> them<00:03:21.120> have<00:03:21.150> animation

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
of these but some of them have animation

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.150 
of these but some of them have animation
so<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.020> could<00:03:22.260> have<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.560> adventure<00:03:22.950> maps

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
so you could have like adventure maps

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.490 
so you could have like adventure maps
wait<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:23.640> front<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.990> can<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.170> go

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
wait in front of you and you can just go

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
wait in front of you and you can just go
around<00:03:26.090> doing<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.510> could<00:03:27.660> even

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
around doing that you could even

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.170 
around doing that you could even
recapture<00:03:28.530> these<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.490> some<00:03:29.820> really

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
recapture these to have like some really

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.340 
recapture these to have like some really
cool<00:03:30.420> animations<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:33.090> that's<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:34.050> all

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
cool animations so that's really all

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.150 
cool animations so that's really all
there<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:36.270> just<00:03:36.480> do<00:03:36.630> block<00:03:37.110> 36<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
there is to it you just do block 36 and

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.550 
there is to it you just do block 36 and
then<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.540> command<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:41.220> does<00:03:41.820> work<00:03:42.330> in<00:03:45.560> command

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
then the command it does work in command

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.900 
then the command it does work in command
blocks<00:03:46.800> but<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.220> works<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.550> little<00:03:47.670> bit

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
blocks but it works a little bit

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.600 
blocks but it works a little bit
different<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.020> did<00:03:49.260> place<00:03:49.560> Spock<00:03:50.070> 36

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
different so if I did place Spock 36

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.220 
different so if I did place Spock 36
here<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:52.080> do<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:53.459> does<00:03:54.180> shift<00:03:54.630> over<00:03:54.930> a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
here and I do that it does shift over a

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.880 
here and I do that it does shift over a
block<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:57.120> still<00:03:57.420> unbreakable<00:03:58.140> but<00:03:58.800> you

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
block and it's still unbreakable but you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.650 
block and it's still unbreakable but you
can't<00:03:59.070> break<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.520> this<00:03:59.670> block<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.270> then<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
can't break in this block and then it

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.480 
can't break in this block and then it
become<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.080> normal<00:04:01.440> one<00:04:01.530> which<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.070> really

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
become the normal one which is really

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.760 
become the normal one which is really
really<00:04:02.820> weird<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.510> don't<00:04:04.110> understand<00:04:04.620> why

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
really weird I don't understand why

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.670 
really weird I don't understand why
command<00:04:05.160> blocks<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:06.150> just

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
command blocks do that you just

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.199 
command blocks do that you just
uncentered<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.550> could<00:04:08.790> have<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> cool

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
uncentered it you could have a cool

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.660 
uncentered it you could have a cool
design<00:04:09.420> like

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
design like

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.009 
design like
if<00:04:12.670> you're<00:04:12.879> making<00:04:13.120> adventure<00:04:13.599> maps<00:04:13.810> you

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
if you're making adventure maps you

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.420 
if you're making adventure maps you
could<00:04:14.140> have<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:14.379> cool<00:04:14.650> sound<00:04:14.950> like<00:04:15.099> that<00:04:15.570> or

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
could have like cool sound like that or

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.650 
could have like cool sound like that or
you<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.549> still<00:04:18.759> go<00:04:18.880> through<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.239> whole<00:04:19.389> block

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
you can still go through the whole block

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.870 
you can still go through the whole block
there<00:04:20.530> is<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:20.979> space<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.549> between<00:04:21.669> each

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
there is a little space in between each

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.779 
there is a little space in between each
blocks<00:04:22.389> but<00:04:23.169> it's<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.860> bit<00:04:24.130> weird<00:04:24.310> how<00:04:24.580> that

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
blocks but it's a bit weird how that

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.200 
blocks but it's a bit weird how that
works<00:04:24.970> up<00:04:25.590> with<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.770> blocks<00:04:27.699> from<00:04:27.910> command

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
works up with the blocks from command

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510 
works up with the blocks from command
blocks<00:04:28.449> I<00:04:28.780> would<00:04:29.440> assume<00:04:29.650> it's<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.009> momentum

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
blocks I would assume it's the momentum

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.080 
blocks I would assume it's the momentum
I<00:04:30.780> don't<00:04:31.780> know<00:04:31.900> but<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.669> go<00:04:33.789> figure<00:04:33.970> that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
I don't know but you can go figure that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.080 
I don't know but you can go figure that
out<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.509> test<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.810> out<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.500> could<00:04:36.090> create

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
out and test it out and you could create

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.779 
out and test it out and you could create
something<00:04:37.419> new<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.960> guess<00:04:38.289> but<00:04:39.070> how<00:04:39.340> thank<00:04:39.669> you

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
something new I guess but how thank you

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.400 
something new I guess but how thank you
guys<00:04:39.940> for<00:04:40.090> watching<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.690> I'll<00:04:40.810> see<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.199> guys
