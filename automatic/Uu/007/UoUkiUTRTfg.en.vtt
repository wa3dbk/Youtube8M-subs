00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
so my next project I'm gonna do and I

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.369 
so my next project I'm gonna do and I
haven't<00:00:05.509> haven't<00:00:06.509> been<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.899> while

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
haven't haven't been on in a while

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.660 
haven't haven't been on in a while
we've<00:00:07.620> moved<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:09.349> got<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> nice<00:00:10.800> area<00:00:11.550> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
we've moved and got this nice area on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.160 
we've moved and got this nice area on
the<00:00:11.759> back<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> deck

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the back of the deck

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.010 
the back of the deck
there's<00:00:13.590> Gracie<00:00:14.130> again<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:17.810> shared<00:00:18.810> in

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
there's Gracie again that I shared in

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
there's Gracie again that I shared in
one<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.439> videos<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:20.400> important<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.210> think

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
one of my videos how important I think

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.040 
one of my videos how important I think
it<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:22.039> environment<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.240> having<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it is environment and just having some a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.310 
it is environment and just having some a
nice<00:00:25.470> setting<00:00:25.980> maybe<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.460> nice<00:00:26.580> music

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
nice setting maybe some nice music

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.509 
nice setting maybe some nice music
anyway<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:28.710> gonna<00:00:28.830> try<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.250> something

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
anyway so I'm gonna try and do something

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.179 
anyway so I'm gonna try and do something
a<00:00:29.730> little<00:00:29.970> unusual<00:00:30.859> something<00:00:31.859> very

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
a little unusual something very

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.510 
a little unusual something very
monochromatic<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.280> table<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.309> my

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
monochromatic this is a table that my

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.560 
monochromatic this is a table that my
son<00:00:36.149> did<00:00:37.100> ceramic<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.550> cool<00:00:38.820> but

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
son did ceramic but it's pretty cool but

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
son did ceramic but it's pretty cool but
this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.290> image<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.399> next

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this is the image that I'm gonna do next

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
this is the image that I'm gonna do next
and<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.989> gonna<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.469> maple<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.129> couple<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and it's gonna be on maple a couple of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.690 
and it's gonna be on maple a couple of
skulls<00:00:45.390> that'll<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.399> kind<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
skulls that'll be kind of just kind of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.760 
skulls that'll be kind of just kind of
off<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> wall<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.660> different<00:00:49.079> see

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
off the wall a little bit different see

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.690 
off the wall a little bit different see
what<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> guys<00:00:50.129> think

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
what you guys think

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
what you guys think
and<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.930> feedback<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.890> there's<00:00:53.070> an

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and get some feedback so there's an

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.720 
and get some feedback so there's an
image<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.960> gonna<00:00:55.110> transfer<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.190> image

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
image so I'm gonna transfer this image

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.650 
image so I'm gonna transfer this image
onto<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.750> maple<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.940> I've<00:00:59.940> already<00:01:00.390> pre

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
onto the maple and I've already pre

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.860 
onto the maple and I've already pre
sanded<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.430> pre<00:01:02.430> routered<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> edges<00:01:03.390> I'll

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
sanded and pre routered the edges I'll

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.490 
sanded and pre routered the edges I'll
probably<00:01:04.409> re<00:01:05.220> router<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.880> edges<00:01:06.330> because<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
probably re router the edges because the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
probably re router the edges because the
grooves<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.549> quite<00:01:08.850> deep<00:01:09.150> enough<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.659> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
grooves are not quite deep enough as you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.190 
grooves are not quite deep enough as you
can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.290> hopefully<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.200> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
can see hopefully you can see that so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
can see hopefully you can see that so
I'm<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.350> sand<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> maybe<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> little

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I'm gonna sand it maybe do it a little

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
I'm gonna sand it maybe do it a little
bit<00:01:15.240> better<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.720> looked<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.619> some<00:01:17.189> grain

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
bit better I looked for some some grain

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
bit better I looked for some some grain
again<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.909> talked<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> my

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
again I talked about that in one of my

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.219 
again I talked about that in one of my
earlier<00:01:19.439> videos<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.610> picking<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> grain<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
earlier videos of picking a grain that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.289 
earlier videos of picking a grain that
would<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.880> probably<00:01:24.420> gonna<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:25.140> with

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
would go well I'm probably gonna go with

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
would go well I'm probably gonna go with
it<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.840> way<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.799> thinking<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.159> you<00:01:32.159> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it this way I'm thinking so that you can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
it this way I'm thinking so that you can
see<00:01:32.549> some<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> grains<00:01:33.299> kind<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.320> shape

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
see some of the grains kind of a shape

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.069 
see some of the grains kind of a shape
going<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> same<00:01:36.659> thing<00:01:36.930> on

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
going like this and the same thing on

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
going like this and the same thing on
the<00:01:37.200> skulls<00:01:37.530> where<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> shapes<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the skulls where the shapes you know a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.399 
the skulls where the shapes you know a
little<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.970> narrower<00:01:41.970> top<00:01:42.509> widening<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
little bit narrower top widening at the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.030 
little bit narrower top widening at the
bottom<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.750> we'll<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.200> how<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> works<00:01:46.770> out

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bottom and we'll see how that works out

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.639 
bottom and we'll see how that works out
I<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.990> thing<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.229> didn't<00:01:49.500> talk<00:01:49.590> about

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I also one thing I didn't talk about

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.889 
I also one thing I didn't talk about
before<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.750> also<00:01:51.930> sand<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> back<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
before is I also sand the back and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.530 
before is I also sand the back and
that's<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.560> give<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.920> extra

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
that's just to kind of give it an extra

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
that's just to kind of give it an extra
finish<00:01:58.369> just<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.640> lends<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.750> an<00:02:00.899> another

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
finish just it just lends to an another

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.190 
finish just it just lends to an another
level<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.310> quality<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.630> I'll<00:02:03.990> be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
level of quality and then I'll be

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
level of quality and then I'll be
putting<00:02:04.530> either<00:02:04.799> router<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> slot<00:02:05.909> or

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
putting either router in a slot or

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.240 
putting either router in a slot or
adding<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.140> picture<00:02:08.810> hanging<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.619> device

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
adding a picture hanging you know device

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
adding a picture hanging you know device
some<00:02:11.849> sort<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.120> metal

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
some sort of metal

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.170 
some sort of metal
we've<00:02:14.129> seen<00:02:14.459> them<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.849> know<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.090> get

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
we've seen them you know you can get

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.210

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
and the other thing you can do is you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.470 
and the other thing you can do is you
can<00:03:01.739> enlarge<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:03.349> reduce<00:03:04.349> as<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:06.060> know<00:03:06.180> your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
can enlarge or reduce as you know your

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.160 
can enlarge or reduce as you know your
your<00:03:06.810> medium<00:03:07.579> requires<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.959> other<00:03:10.079> thing

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
your medium requires it the other thing

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.280 
your medium requires it the other thing
I<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.359> may<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:12.599> may<00:03:12.720> not<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.959> seen<00:03:13.140> in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
I do and you may or may not have seen in

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
I do and you may or may not have seen in
other<00:03:13.440> videos<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.010> keep<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.549> background<00:03:14.970> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
other videos I keep the background I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.240 
other videos I keep the background I
always<00:03:15.510> keep<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.840> background<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.890> reason<00:03:17.190> I

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
always keep the background the reason I

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.650 
always keep the background the reason I
do<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.510> might<00:03:18.599> be

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
do that is because there might be

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.210 
do that is because there might be
something<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.739> case<00:03:19.919> it's<00:03:20.160> just

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
something in it in this case it's just

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.300 
something in it in this case it's just
black<00:03:20.549> like<00:03:20.819> it's<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.120> monochrome<00:03:21.660> type

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
black like it's a monochrome type

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.390 
black like it's a monochrome type
arrangement<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:24.260> what<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.889> that<00:03:26.190> is

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
arrangement but what I do that is

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.050 
arrangement but what I do that is
because<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.760> might<00:03:27.030> want<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:28.700> decide<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> might

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
because I might want to decide I might

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.050 
because I might want to decide I might
want<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.299> cut<00:03:30.510> out<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:31.079> example<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:32.280> shadow

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
want to cut out for example a shadow

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.629 
want to cut out for example a shadow
area<00:03:33.599> around<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.440> lay<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.889> on<00:03:34.950> there<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
area around and lay that on there and

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.819 
area around and lay that on there and
see<00:03:36.329> how<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.540> looks<00:03:36.690> before<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.260> go<00:03:37.470> burning

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
see how that looks before I go burning

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.190 
see how that looks before I go burning
all<00:03:37.919> that<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.790> I'm<00:03:38.880> all<00:03:39.060> probably<00:03:39.840> burn<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
all that on so I'm all probably burn the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.080

and<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> couple<00:04:26.110> lines<00:04:26.470> are<00:04:26.650> gonna<00:04:26.740> come

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
and so a couple lines are gonna come

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.350 
and so a couple lines are gonna come
away<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.639> then<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.330> just<00:04:28.360> gonna<00:04:28.599> do<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.840> final

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
away and then I'm just gonna do a final

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.520 
away and then I'm just gonna do a final
final<00:04:31.360> thing<00:04:33.539> so<00:04:34.539> this<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:34.990> again<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:35.469> is

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
final thing so this is again this is

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.520 
final thing so this is again this is
just<00:04:35.830> roughing<00:04:36.189> in<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.460> templates<00:04:37.319> so<00:04:38.319> here

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
just roughing in the templates so here

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.709 
just roughing in the templates so here
you<00:04:38.650> can<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:39.009> I've<00:04:39.159> laid<00:04:39.400> in<00:04:39.580> some<00:04:39.849> interior

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
you can see I've laid in some interior

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.929 
you can see I've laid in some interior
lines<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:42.340> eyes<00:04:42.870> teeth<00:04:43.870> nose<00:04:44.639> kind<00:04:45.639> of<00:04:45.759> funny

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:45.939 
lines the eyes teeth nose kind of funny

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.390 
lines the eyes teeth nose kind of funny
how<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.180> nose<00:04:46.449> reminds<00:04:47.020> me<00:04:47.229> of<00:04:47.349> an<00:04:47.469> upside

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
how the nose reminds me of an upside

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.129 
how the nose reminds me of an upside
down<00:04:48.430> heart<00:04:48.849> but<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.479> guess<00:04:49.629> that's<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> way<00:04:50.050> it

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
down heart but I guess that's the way it

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.510 
down heart but I guess that's the way it
is<00:04:50.259> with<00:04:50.379> a<00:04:50.439> skull<00:04:52.500> dark<00:04:53.500> darkened<00:04:54.219> areas

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
is with a skull dark darkened areas

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.999 
is with a skull dark darkened areas
haven't<00:04:54.909> laid<00:04:55.030> in<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.300> teeth<00:04:55.509> of<00:04:55.719> the<00:04:56.009> lower

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
haven't laid in the teeth of the lower

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.619 
haven't laid in the teeth of the lower
skull<00:04:57.430> yet<00:04:57.639> but<00:04:57.879> you<00:04:57.940> can<00:04:58.090> just<00:04:58.240> see<00:04:58.419> some

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
skull yet but you can just see some

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:04.170 
skull yet but you can just see some
blocking<00:04:59.199> that<00:05:00.099> I'm<00:05:00.250> doing<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:02.940> that's<00:05:03.940> gonna

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
blocking that I'm doing and that's gonna

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.369 
blocking that I'm doing and that's gonna
be<00:05:04.389> general<00:05:04.870> areas<00:05:05.289> for<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:06.310> light<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.729> dark

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
be general areas for the light and dark

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.520 
be general areas for the light and dark
and<00:05:08.379> then<00:05:08.680> just<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.129> know<00:05:09.159> they<00:05:09.759> continue<00:05:10.300> to

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
and then just you know they continue to

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.580 
and then just you know they continue to
draw<00:05:11.530> any<00:05:11.770> race<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:12.310> as<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.520> can<00:05:12.699> see<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.590> did

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
draw any race and as you can see I did

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.890 
draw any race and as you can see I did
it<00:05:14.620> larger<00:05:15.190> than<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.550> actual<00:05:15.940> image<00:05:16.330> so

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
it larger than the actual image so

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.140 
it larger than the actual image so
there's<00:05:17.710> some<00:05:17.860> scaling<00:05:18.400> going<00:05:18.699> on<00:05:18.849> and<00:05:19.090> it

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
there's some scaling going on and it

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.790 
there's some scaling going on and it
gets<00:05:19.300> kind<00:05:19.659> of<00:05:19.719> tricky<00:05:19.870> on<00:05:20.139> the<00:05:20.259> interior

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
gets kind of tricky on the interior

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.269 
gets kind of tricky on the interior
because<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.520> have<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.729> scale<00:05:22.000> up<00:05:22.270> without

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
because you have to scale up without

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.469 
because you have to scale up without
distorting<00:05:24.279> things<00:05:25.740> but<00:05:26.740> again<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.580> you

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
distorting things but again it's you

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.570 
distorting things but again it's you
know<00:05:28.569> don't<00:05:28.810> have<00:05:28.960> fear<00:05:29.349> of<00:05:29.400> doing<00:05:30.400> those

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
know don't have fear of doing those

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.089 
know don't have fear of doing those
things<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:31.319> keep<00:05:32.319> in<00:05:32.469> mind<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:32.860> things

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
things just keep in mind that things

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.890 
things just keep in mind that things
that<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.550> takes<00:05:33.819> to<00:05:34.210> put<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:34.960> together<00:05:35.110> so

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
that it takes to put it together so

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.559 
that it takes to put it together so
anyway<00:05:37.900> there's<00:05:38.379> probably<00:05:39.339> my<00:05:39.569> finished

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
anyway there's probably my finished

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.029 
anyway there's probably my finished
layout<00:05:42.479> when<00:05:43.479> I'm<00:05:43.569> gonna<00:05:43.690> start<00:05:43.990> with<00:05:44.139> and<00:05:44.949> I

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
layout when I'm gonna start with and I

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.809 
layout when I'm gonna start with and I
can<00:05:45.190> always<00:05:45.460> erase<00:05:46.060> some<00:05:46.360> more<00:05:46.569> or<00:05:47.699> you<00:05:48.699> know

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
can always erase some more or you know

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.740 
can always erase some more or you know
sand<00:05:49.360> out<00:05:49.860> Italy<00:05:50.860> race<00:05:51.069> now<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.849> then<00:05:52.419> also

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
sand out Italy race now and then also

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.829 
sand out Italy race now and then also
after<00:05:53.229> you<00:05:53.409> would<00:05:53.620> burn<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:53.979> you<00:05:54.599> race<00:05:55.599> out

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
after you would burn it you race out

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.670 
after you would burn it you race out
your<00:05:55.990> finish<00:05:56.259> lines<00:05:56.469> anyway<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:58.440> there<00:05:59.440> we'll

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
your finish lines anyway so there we'll

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.490 
your finish lines anyway so there we'll
give<00:06:00.580> it<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.699> start<00:06:00.969> and<00:06:01.270> jump<00:06:01.900> right<00:06:02.050> into<00:06:02.289> the

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
give it a start and jump right into the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.029 
give it a start and jump right into the
burning<00:06:02.650> part<00:06:03.839> so<00:06:04.839> here<00:06:05.110> this<00:06:05.289> morning<00:06:05.710> no

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
burning part so here this morning no

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.159 
burning part so here this morning no
yeah<00:06:06.460> there's<00:06:06.819> crazy<00:06:07.089> she's<00:06:07.659> looking<00:06:07.900> for<00:06:08.080> her

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
yeah there's crazy she's looking for her

ball<00:06:08.349> I<00:06:08.680> have<00:06:09.639> it<00:06:09.759> hidden<00:06:09.909> because<00:06:10.300> she<00:06:10.710> gets

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
ball I have it hidden because she gets

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.670 
ball I have it hidden because she gets
so<00:06:12.009> noisy<00:06:12.219> and<00:06:12.430> crazy<00:06:12.759> when<00:06:13.029> I<00:06:13.289> when<00:06:14.289> she<00:06:14.469> sees

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
so noisy and crazy when I when she sees

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.930 
so noisy and crazy when I when she sees
it<00:06:14.710> anyway<00:06:15.639> here<00:06:16.360> we<00:06:16.479> are<00:06:16.740> it's<00:06:17.740> morning

it anyway here we are it's morning

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.990 
it anyway here we are it's morning
last<00:06:19.419> night<00:06:19.690> it<00:06:19.960> did<00:06:20.139> some<00:06:20.789> filling<00:06:21.789> in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
last night it did some filling in

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.760 
last night it did some filling in
shading<00:06:22.719> you<00:06:22.839> can<00:06:23.020> see<00:06:23.349> the<00:06:24.009> various<00:06:25.770> areas

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
shading you can see the various areas

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.920 
shading you can see the various areas
where<00:06:26.979> there<00:06:27.129> was<00:06:27.389> there's<00:06:28.389> still<00:06:28.599> a<00:06:28.629> lot<00:06:28.810> of

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
where there was there's still a lot of

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.439 
where there was there's still a lot of
pencil<00:06:29.289> marks<00:06:29.669> but<00:06:30.669> it<00:06:30.819> kind<00:06:31.000> of<00:06:31.029> gives<00:06:31.240> you<00:06:31.300> an

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
pencil marks but it kind of gives you an

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.350 
pencil marks but it kind of gives you an
idea<00:06:31.599> of

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.159 

you<00:06:34.720> know<00:06:35.490> just<00:06:36.490> laying<00:06:36.729> out<00:06:36.909> the<00:06:37.240> boundary

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
you know just laying out the boundary

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.399 
you know just laying out the boundary
I'm<00:06:38.289> gonna<00:06:38.470> create<00:06:39.069> a<00:06:39.129> lot<00:06:39.310> more<00:06:39.419> black<00:06:40.419> the

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
I'm gonna create a lot more black the

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.559 
I'm gonna create a lot more black the
outside<00:06:41.889> they'll<00:06:42.159> be<00:06:42.310> the<00:06:42.610> eyes<00:06:42.819> will<00:06:43.120> be<00:06:43.300> a

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
outside they'll be the eyes will be a

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:48.839 
outside they'll be the eyes will be a
lot<00:06:44.530> darker<00:06:44.860> and<00:06:47.400> there'll<00:06:48.400> be<00:06:48.430> a<00:06:48.550> lot<00:06:48.669> more

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
lot darker and there'll be a lot more
