Lavigne<00:00:21.330> yeah<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.840> first<00:00:22.080> step<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.619> no

with<00:01:01.500> nebulous<00:01:02.070> Neptune<00:01:02.579> there's<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.270> element

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
with nebulous Neptune there's an element

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
with nebulous Neptune there's an element

that which is real versus that which is
not<00:01:10.080> real<00:01:11.299> doesn't<00:01:12.299> matter<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
not real doesn't matter right and I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
not real doesn't matter right and I
think<00:01:13.950> another<00:01:14.220> reason<00:01:14.490> we're<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> push

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
think another reason we're going to push

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
think another reason we're going to push
the<00:01:15.330> edges<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> Sun<00:01:16.049> runs<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> hard

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the edges the Sun runs into a hard

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
the edges the Sun runs into a hard
aspect<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.580> expansive<00:01:18.150> Jupiter<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.170> diverse

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
aspect with expansive Jupiter in diverse

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
aspect with expansive Jupiter in diverse
Gemini<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.670> we're<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
Gemini so we're going to get a lot more

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
Gemini so we're going to get a lot more
ideas<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> lot<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:22.470> choices<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.250> we

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
ideas and a lot more choices that we

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.910 
ideas and a lot more choices that we
then<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.210> possibly<00:01:24.509> apply<00:01:25.110> yeah<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
then we can possibly apply yeah and I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.859 
then we can possibly apply yeah and I
think<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> key<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> day<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.630> with

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
think here the key to the day is with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
think here the key to the day is with
all<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.380> outgoing<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.220> expansive<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
all of this outgoing and expansive of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
all of this outgoing and expansive of
energy<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.470> Jupiter<00:01:31.950> opening<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.640> minds

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
energy with Jupiter opening our minds

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.530 
energy with Jupiter opening our minds
and<00:01:33.210> Neptune<00:01:33.799> flooding<00:01:34.799> our<00:01:35.070> minds<00:01:35.610> wide<00:01:36.000> open

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and Neptune flooding our minds wide open

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
and Neptune flooding our minds wide open
I<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> key<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.950> we're<00:01:38.100> going

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I think the key is that if we're going

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
I think the key is that if we're going
to<00:01:38.280> make<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> most<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.060> intellectual

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to make the most of that intellectual

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.410 
to make the most of that intellectual
Aquarius<00:01:40.290> moon<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:41.070> simply<00:01:41.430> recognize<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
Aquarius moon to simply recognize that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
Aquarius moon to simply recognize that
we<00:01:42.570> can't<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.110> everything<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.220> everywhere

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
we can't be everything and everywhere

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.020 
we can't be everything and everywhere
