now<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:08.970> more<00:01:09.000> work<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
now where I can do some more work and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.980 
now where I can do some more work and
get<00:01:10.290> back<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> my<00:01:10.770> hobbies<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.299> took<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> out

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
get back to my hobbies so I took it out

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
get back to my hobbies so I took it out
of<00:01:13.140> mothballs<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.979> used<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> first

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
of mothballs and I used it for the first

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.010 
of mothballs and I used it for the first
time<00:01:15.020> last<00:01:16.020> week<00:01:16.939> anyway<00:01:17.939> I'd<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> give

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
time last week anyway I'd like to give

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you an overview what the machine is all

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.070 
you an overview what the machine is all
about<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> near<00:01:24.180> future<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.780> going

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
about and in the near future I'm going

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
about and in the near future I'm going
to<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.670> doing<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:27.060> projects<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.640> using<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to be doing some projects and using this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.480 
to be doing some projects and using this
machine<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.540> I'll<00:01:31.170> post<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.710> short<00:01:31.860> video

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
machine and I'll post a short video

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.450 
machine and I'll post a short video
clips<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.960> versatile<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.950> machine<00:01:35.310> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
clips of how versatile a machine like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
clips of how versatile a machine like
this<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:39.650> first<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:41.659> start<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.720> an

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this can be first of all start with an

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
this can be first of all start with an
engine<00:01:43.530> block<00:01:43.770> four-cylinder<00:01:44.579> engine<00:01:44.880> block

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
engine block four-cylinder engine block

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.760 
engine block four-cylinder engine block
and<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:47.579> made<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:49.250> spindle<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.200> one

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and I made a spindle to go in in the one

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.609 
and I made a spindle to go in in the one
of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> end<00:01:53.130> cylinders<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.990> spindle<00:01:55.470> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of the end cylinders the spindle I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.429 
of the end cylinders the spindle I
turned<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.670> accepts<00:01:57.439> c5

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
turned it out so that it accepts c5

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.670 
turned it out so that it accepts c5
kaulitz<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.750> right<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:00.899> there's<00:02:01.170> an<00:02:01.350> end

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
kaulitz and right now there's an end

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560 
kaulitz and right now there's an end
mill<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.000> job<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.450> was

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
mill in there because the job I was

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
mill in there because the job I was
doing<00:02:03.869> required<00:02:04.259> me<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
doing required me to to use that but I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.930 
doing required me to to use that but I
also<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> tooling<00:02:09.209> for

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
also have the tooling for

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.840 
also have the tooling for
milling<00:02:11.840> cutters<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.250> over<00:02:13.670> arm

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
milling cutters and this is the over arm

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.340 
milling cutters and this is the over arm
support<00:02:14.500> when<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:16.420> put<00:02:17.420> your<00:02:17.570> milling<00:02:18.140> cutter

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
support when you put your milling cutter

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.980 
support when you put your milling cutter
shaft<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.890> here<00:02:19.160> it's<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:20.180> connecting<00:02:20.960> rod

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
shaft in here it's just a connecting rod

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.940 
shaft in here it's just a connecting rod
that<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.410> use<00:02:21.590> for<00:02:21.860> an<00:02:22.100> overarm<00:02:22.640> support<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
that I use for an overarm support the

that I use for an overarm support the
milling<00:02:25.670> table<00:02:26.090> itself<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:27.080> a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
milling table itself is just a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.810 
milling table itself is just a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
chinese-made the small cross fly table

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.450 
chinese-made the small cross fly table
that<00:02:32.000> came<00:02:32.240> from<00:02:32.510> busy<00:02:33.260> be<00:02:33.380> tools<00:02:33.740> in<00:02:33.950> Canada

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
that came from busy be tools in Canada

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.670 
that came from busy be tools in Canada
and<00:02:36.130> for<00:02:37.130> my<00:02:37.340> vertical<00:02:38.150> movement<00:02:38.720> I've<00:02:38.840> got<00:02:39.080> a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
and for my vertical movement I've got a
