I usually put one up and one going down

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
I usually put one up and one going down
because<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.090> seems<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
because that way it it just seems a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.200 
because that way it it just seems a
little<00:01:24.420> more<00:01:24.720> secure<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:26.009> me

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.980 
so we've got one side taken care of and
let's<00:02:10.310> move<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.759> other<00:02:10.880> side<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.810> just

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
let's move to the other side you just

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.840 
let's move to the other side you just
repeat<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> same<00:02:12.620> steps<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.250> take<00:02:13.490> half<00:02:13.760> of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
repeat the same steps you take half of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.480 
repeat the same steps you take half of
the<00:02:13.970> hair<00:02:14.180> that's<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:16.340> don't
