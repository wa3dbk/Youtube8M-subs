00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.490 
and down come up and turn the head and
shoulders<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.670> turn<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> turn<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
shoulders and down turn up and turn the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.819 
shoulders and down turn up and turn the
head<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.799> shoulders<00:01:59.159> so<00:02:00.680> when<00:02:01.680> you're

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
head and shoulders so when you're

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
head and shoulders so when you're
putting<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.399> together<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.119> practice

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
putting it all together you can practice

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
putting it all together you can practice
just<00:02:03.869> standing<00:02:04.020> still<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.770> board<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
just standing still on your board and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.460 
just standing still on your board and
just<00:02:06.090> dragging<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.720> front<00:02:07.020> foot<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
just dragging your front foot up the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.190 
just dragging your front foot up the
board<00:02:07.710> over<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.519> over<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.239> over<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.629> over

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
board over and over and over and over

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
board over and over and over and over
again<00:02:10.499> while<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:11.700> turning<00:02:11.939> your<00:02:12.209> head<00:02:12.359> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
again while you're turning your head and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.710 
again while you're turning your head and
shoulders<00:02:12.719> now<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:14.069> for<00:02:14.309> you<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.669> fills<00:02:14.969> more

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
shoulders now if for you it fills more

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
shoulders now if for you it fills more
durable<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.710> way<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.910> learn

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
durable to go this way you can learn

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.660 
durable to go this way you can learn
this<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:18.660> eighty-first<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.710> honestly<00:02:20.580> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
this one eighty-first but honestly I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.670 
this one eighty-first but honestly I
suggest<00:02:21.570> learning<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> front<00:02:22.200> side<00:02:22.410> 180

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
suggest learning the front side 180

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.710 
suggest learning the front side 180
first<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.400> going<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> other<00:02:24.390> direction

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
first which is going the other direction

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.760 
first which is going the other direction
that<00:02:25.560> would<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.610> me<00:02:26.640> turning<00:02:27.630> my<00:02:27.900> head<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
that would be for me turning my head to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.700 
that would be for me turning my head to
the<00:02:29.160> right<00:02:29.430> side<00:02:29.760> rather<00:02:30.540> than<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.470> left

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
the right side rather than to the left

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.920 
the right side rather than to the left
side<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:33.180> what<00:02:33.330> you're<00:02:33.510> doing<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.870> you're

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
side so but what you're doing is you're

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.600 
side so but what you're doing is you're
turning<00:02:34.320> your<00:02:34.410> head<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.740> left<00:02:34.830> side<00:02:35.160> which

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
turning your head to the left side which

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.300 
turning your head to the left side which
is<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> backside<00:02:36.450> 180<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.710> when<00:02:37.890> you're<00:02:38.010> going

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
is a backside 180 so when you're going

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.580 
is a backside 180 so when you're going
straight<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.540> pop<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
straight and you pop up and you do the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
straight and you pop up and you do the
180<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.250> your<00:02:41.880> back<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.390> facing<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.900> direction

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
180 if your back is facing the direction

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.800 
180 if your back is facing the direction
you're<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.790> backside<00:02:45.210> 180<00:02:45.570> if

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
you're going that's a backside 180 if

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.620 
you're going that's a backside 180 if
you<00:02:46.470> pop<00:02:46.740> up<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> turn<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.000> front<00:02:48.360> is

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
you pop up and turn in your front is

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.390 
you pop up and turn in your front is
facing<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.380> direction<00:02:49.560> you're<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.010> that's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
facing the direction you're going that's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.790 
facing the direction you're going that's
a<00:02:50.550> frontside<00:02:50.940> 180<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.050> that's<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.530> little

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
a frontside 180 so that's just a little

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.240 
a frontside 180 so that's just a little
tidbit<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:54.260> help<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.560> know<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.950> difference

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
tidbit on to help to know the difference

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
tidbit on to help to know the difference
between<00:02:56.280> frontside<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.030> backside<00:02:57.290> cool<00:02:58.290> so

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
between frontside and backside cool so

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.199 
between frontside and backside cool so
what<00:02:58.590> i'm<00:02:58.680> doing<00:02:58.920> here<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.340> popping<00:03:00.060> up

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
what i'm doing here is just popping up

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.880 
what i'm doing here is just popping up
landing<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> nose<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.530> then<00:03:01.620> doing<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
landing on the nose and then doing a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.880 
landing on the nose and then doing a
little<00:03:02.070> pivot<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:03.300> requires<00:03:04.080> quite<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> bit

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
little pivot this requires quite a bit

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.370 
little pivot this requires quite a bit
of<00:03:05.040> board<00:03:05.340> control<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.810> i<00:03:06.840> think<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.200> you're

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
of board control so i think if you're

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.720 
of board control so i think if you're
going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.590> learn<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.800> do<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> pivot<00:03:08.550> you're

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
going to learn to do the pivot you're

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.190 
going to learn to do the pivot you're
going<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.209> get<00:03:09.450> your<00:03:09.600> Ollie's<00:03:09.959> down<00:03:09.990> a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
going to have to get your Ollie's down a

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.620 
going to have to get your Ollie's down a
little<00:03:10.500> bit<00:03:10.740> better<00:03:11.040> because<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:12.150> only<00:03:12.180> then

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
little bit better because not only then

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.570 
little bit better because not only then
you<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.020> learn<00:03:13.110> how<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.320> ollie<00:03:13.520> but<00:03:14.520> you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
you have to learn how to ollie but you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.550 
you have to learn how to ollie but you
have<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> learn<00:03:14.910> how<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.120> ollie<00:03:15.260> land<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
have to learn how to ollie land on the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.440 
have to learn how to ollie land on the
nose<00:03:16.770> while<00:03:17.670> turning<00:03:17.940> your<00:03:18.180> head<00:03:18.300> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
nose while turning your head and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
nose while turning your head and
shoulders<00:03:18.630> remain<00:03:19.140> balanced<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:19.920> then<00:03:20.070> turn

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
shoulders remain balanced and then turn

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.360 
shoulders remain balanced and then turn
your<00:03:20.519> feet<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.660> yeah<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.709> learn<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.160> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
your feet so yeah you can learn that it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
your feet so yeah you can learn that it
is<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.519> good<00:03:23.790> gradient<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> good<00:03:24.930> step<00:03:25.200> on

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
is a good gradient it is a good step on

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.759 
is a good gradient it is a good step on
the<00:03:25.950> 180<00:03:26.550> but<00:03:27.269> other<00:03:27.540> than<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.170> highly

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the 180 but other than that I highly

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.400 
the 180 but other than that I highly
suggest<00:03:29.090> just<00:03:30.090> practicing<00:03:30.870> turning<00:03:31.260> your

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
suggest just practicing turning your

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.370 
suggest just practicing turning your
head<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.709> shoulders<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:33.300> stand<00:03:33.840> still<00:03:34.170> on

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
head and shoulders as you stand still on

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.920 
head and shoulders as you stand still on
the<00:03:34.470> board<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.920> stand<00:03:35.280> perfectly<00:03:35.550> still<00:03:35.930> just

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the board so stand perfectly still just

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.870 
the board so stand perfectly still just
drag<00:03:37.200> your<00:03:37.230> foot<00:03:37.590> up<00:03:37.769> over<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.400> over<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.760> over
