 salty meat that I have not tasted 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.660
 but it is a delight to note the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.939
 recipe 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 We cut the corn in the two 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.210
 ends and withdraws paid with enough 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.059
 be careful to at least get 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.579
 three or four whole leaves the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.699
 whole pages are blanched in water 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.859
 fervent just to be inflexible and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.980
 on a damp cloth not to dry 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.290
 now kneads and agrees spike in the middle 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 to facilitate the removal of the grains 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.810
 is made on the knife and corn goes to 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810
 blender 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.460
 the dough in the bowl is mixed with the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.040
 melted butter and still hot is this 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.530
 that will prevent the tamale is dry 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.470

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.470
 basic mass of pamonha and can make 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.979
 two choices or choose the sweet pamonha 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.380
 Are you going to use clove and cinnamon sugar or 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.810
 salt that igor will do 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.360
 only that more implemented the touch 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.150

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.630

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.220
 I yelled before putting them on and now 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.550
 the seasonings half a spoonful of cumin 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.790
 the same amount of pepper and attention 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.310
 flexal saves normally and then when 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.130
 think it's fine, put some more 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.979
 because the water of cooking aa germany 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.729
 will only lose the little pack of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.070
 fool 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.019
 we will fold the middle and middle of 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.049
 and double again in this direction and 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.269
 open like a cup 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.810

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.190

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.549

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.549
 We'll close the little pack of ammonia. 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.180
 the pamonhas cook in salted water for 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.700
 half an hour 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.590
