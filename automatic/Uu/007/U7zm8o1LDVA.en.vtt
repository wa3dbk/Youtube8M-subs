00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.650
 composed of several elements that 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.689
 intertwine that intertwine for 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.180
 pay tribute to the legacy of Cervantes 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.530
 so we had fun with dancers 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.110
 who come from different backgrounds of 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.500
 to form a new ballet corps 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.880
 still ball and today who 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.200
 proposes a new way of being 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.270
 together or everyone is different matters 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.670

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.909
 I asked carole if he would 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.700
 to teach some of my dancers and 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.189
 of my dancers variations of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.749
 leave of bailiff of the ballet in the 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.869
 original ballet 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:17.240
 some are squarely 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.009
 fragments of variation of small steps and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.049
 after he is cases lille and diverts 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.030
 with a contemporary urban gesture 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.390
 or sometimes dance elements 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.390
 African 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.410
 the choice of patrice it was necessary all 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 choreographers know it to create a 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.890
 work that is humor they are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.830
 burlesque you need a great interpreter 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.320
 who himself is already an interpreter 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.390
 let's say new burlesque who the sense of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 humor the team that can wear 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.830
 work and honors 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.800
 he made me the friendship to participate in this 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.500
 project is to bring a little bit of 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.550
 to play the role of a don quixote 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.910
 completely quirky very funny very who 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.360
 tilts between the hostel sometimes at 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.580
 ballet of small steps but at the same time 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.090
 the reversal of meaning humor irony 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.520
 etc. 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.970
 these are different postures he 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.970
 embodies very flamboyantly 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.200
 we tried to imagine a Don Quixote 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.850
 urban ie to someone from whom 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 knows that by the force of his desire he 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.360
 does not want to transform the world but who 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.819
 dream of transforming in any case of life 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.090
 everyday in the can 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.069
 what life and we imagined a person 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.450
 who could be patrice where all 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.969
 could also be who is also a 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.849
 old man patrice old man who is 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:49.159
 walk in the Paris metro and who in 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.409
 according to the aggressions of the ads of the 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.989
 who see who reinvents 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.849
 every time a little bit there is 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.120
 a lot of room given to dance and 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.210
 with very elaborate punctuations a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.820
 a whole game of 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.790
 interaction technology image 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.590
 between the real and the logical imaginary 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.380
 but much less present than in 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.620
 our brooms indoors I think more 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.620
 strong
