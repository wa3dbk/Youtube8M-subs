full-size<00:02:09.610> boards<00:02:12.720> we've<00:02:13.720> done<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.110> by

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
full-size boards we've done this by

what<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:26.920> does<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.970> gives<00:02:28.239> us<00:02:28.480> more<00:02:29.110> room<00:02:29.170> for

what this does it gives us more room for

what this does it gives us more room for
a<00:02:29.830> motherboard<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.720> reduces<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.319> size<00:02:32.500> of
