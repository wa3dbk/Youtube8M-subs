00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 Tell me guys, Bruno, just seven back. 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 everything beauty good 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.549
 in today's video bringing you a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.949
 quick tim booth medium in the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.320
 map Plaza art of cool that I 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.150
 get what's very different even to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.189
 I therefore play how much to bring to the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.560
 channel a match tim neff medium has 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 played much with the fame but 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.609
 lately i have a little staying 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.189
 a little tired of what you consume no 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 Understand me poorly is still my way of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 favorite game but the matches 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.380
 they are taking too long and they are being 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.879
 always very big and sometimes people 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.710
 want a more dynamic match a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.899
 Faster team and the team 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 deathmatch this is it's come in to kill one 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.320
 Little died a little bit already. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
 party for another party already experiencing 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 new weapons, etc., which is still the case 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 my favorite mode 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600
 but it's not always that I'm stingy 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.670
 to be able to play games always of ten 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.859
 minutes there is a lot these parties have 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.969
 finished on time inclusive is not always 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.800
 I 'm in this pique sometimes I want 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.719
 one more run something more dynamic 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.820
 mine it was always my way 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.260
 Favorite thing recently stopped being me 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 I already explained this to you in video if 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.619
 You suddenly did not get this video there. 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 I will leave the registration if the woman who 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.010
 a pretty good video that I speak to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.780
 respect of my thinking about the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.700
 change in what they did 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 problem the two can see that I am 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.150
 playing and with the copies 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.009
 I'm doing what's beyond her to 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 picking up the hemp goal is the last 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.770
 Lack of picking up my first class from the NGO. 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.869
 I love that it will be the obvious smg I will 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 to exchange goal also in the research is 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.189
 that mine that left lc but more to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.680
 forward for now I'll do more 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.930
 because it's the one I need to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.310
 search does not count to diamond for you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.619
 To get diamond in her you have to have 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.780
 gold but you do not depend on it to have gold 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.360
 to be able to catch daemon in the others 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 Armines there, then, to be soon. 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.390
 You will see another game place school 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.369
 piollin because mine that I have 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.100
 I used it or unlock most of the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.340
 who made chÃ©ri on this weapon and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.170
 unlocked with a tokin prestige but 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.299
 I'd rather not because I do not like 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.280
 this weapon not at all then I turn 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.170
 prestige time that arrives there from download 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.420
 and I think it's 40 and I do not even know the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.099
 level that she releases but when she gets there 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.110
 I use a little bit so she 's being 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.530
 time is being difficult but it has no 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.810
 hurry 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.880
 I also know there about seven prestigious 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.400
 in front then you can do it there 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.530
 rest assured 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.580
 good people left touching a subject with 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.140
 you quickly 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.890
 It's one of the ones I wanted to talk to you about. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.480
 It is just to clarify a situation with 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.459
 relation to some comments that I 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.420
 I have received from you and I usually 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.350
 I usually respond with attitude 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.580
 bringing in videos when you sometimes have 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.410
 some complaint that you make the time 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.330
 improve in the next video a suggestion 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.700
 and what I want to talk about 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.310
 zombies and multiplayer issue here at 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.500
 my channel is now the end and the middle 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.690
 from December to here I received several 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.730
 message in such a large mass that it is 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.620
 hard to ignore too many people 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.269
 Complaining said on your channel is 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.709
 becoming a bruno multiplayer channel 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.360
 is leaving men aside because 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.400
 I was actually posting a little 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.500
 more multiplayer had already downloaded that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.330
 men's fever that eagerness to play 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.950
 the men then was already playing a 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.600
 bit more multiply and was getting 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.790
 play better also after corrections 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.510
 I entered the room and it got better for 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.250
 can play 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.650
 I like both multiplayer and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.260
 My zombie channel and my channel has always been 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 of the two actually my channel has always been 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.160
 much more multiplayer than men 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.170
 if you will look at my background in your 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.299
 video player multiplayer event I have 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.459
 200 and varied and 50 videos 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.220
 I can assure you and at least 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.320
 150 of these videos is multiplayer 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.600
 So I know there was a galley that 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.989
 arrived on my channel headshot isiely 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.769
 now I love getting this neckline and I know 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.359
 what's up guys who arrived 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.739
 recently from my channel and arrived in 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.959
 moment it was having a movement 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.790
 of men too big this is easy to 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.620
 explain why this is how you launched it. 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.810
 blackbox two guys we were over 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.430
 one year without having anything new in the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 men to play because we had 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.840
 had more than a year ago the last 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.340
 them and the black ops one and then the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.280
 for a long time without having any 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.600
 novelty and carlos came very different 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400
 he came much bigger 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.769
 see with different game mode came 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.940
 with gigantic maps a lot of 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.290
 ministries to cover 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.420
 so I needed to pay more attention 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.040
 for men and it is obvious that I know that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.440
 Did you like this after all? 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.000
 majority of the people who arrived in 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.880
 and it was exactly on account of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.070
 these videos but my channel will never 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.750
 be exclusive to zombies and to guys 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.960
 who complained that he was turning into a 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.960
 multiemployee make a comparative 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.870
 you have an idea is when it came out of the cops 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.630
 2 from when you left cops 2 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.240
 I posted 39 videos of zombies and only 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.009
 12 videos and multiply 13 with this one 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.169
 and I'm not counting the live stream 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.840
 says if not I do not believe I did 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.539
 one of multiplayer and all other 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.979
 were the men then my channel of 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.229
 November here is being very 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.270
 turning a channel of men is actually 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.220
 so just I wanted to justify not me 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.900
 misunderstand I'm not fighting with 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.759
 You complained that you were posting 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.919
 multiplayer I 'm not arguing with you 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.050
 What are you charging me for zombie video? 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.150
 I like this collection well, I like this collection. 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.889
 billing is illegal because if I see that 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.240
 you are active on the channel when you 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.840
 Are you interested that you want more 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.970
 videos 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.889
 so I just like this one so I 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.320
 I need to explain, cara. I needed you. 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.330
 make you understand that you will have multiplayer 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.250
 who will have other games including me 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.740
 I'll pass bring not only can to the 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.090
 the channel will not be 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.669
 exclusive of men of course I go 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.530
 having a huge focus on men is my 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.270
 specialty is the only thing I know 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.319
 to play even though multiplayer is a 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.330
 filth 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.759
 I'm not very good at men but at least 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.349
 but there I defend myself a little better 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.720
 so I 'll continue to have an attention 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.430
 very special omp term for you that 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.259
 subscribed to my channel on behalf of 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.580
 men you will not be disappointed in 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.180
 moment no guy can be sure 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.800
 of this 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.930
 you're going to always be looking at 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.460
 videos you expect to see men 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.409
 here on channel + 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.539
 I will give attention to other games were 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.699
 I also wanted to let multiplayer 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.409
 This is clear because it was a volume like 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.669
 I spoke the volume of messages very large 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.469
 I could not ignore 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.449
 I needed to address this response. 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.009
 You're beauty, but that's it, folks. I'll go. 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.139
 to close the video here I'll ask 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.909
 for you to rate the video and leave a 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.800
 comment and sign up for the channel if 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.599
 you have not registered yet I'll see you in the 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.599
 Next video a hug
