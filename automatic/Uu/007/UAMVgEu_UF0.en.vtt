 terry knife only face so that is a whole 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 large distribution that on blood tracks with 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.190
 tendon the sucade look what it can 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 to make 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.320
 come come come come then pontoon 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.140
 that man that interest already full 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.370
 rue no good apply nice pair of span 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.530
 really who can the who can to the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.000
 paralympics with its pussy base also 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the figures the file now does not equal that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.329
 friend individual to like the past 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.739
 videos have every time around the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.479
 300 achieved 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.610
 To get going now look more goals against 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.290
 view goal against the legs 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 but not done within 10 minutes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.060
 the crazy thing too and how are we doing this 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.650

 person who advocates can take this way 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 activate again 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
