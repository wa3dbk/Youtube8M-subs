now<00:00:26.189> previously<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.029> showed<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.359> how<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
now previously I showed you how to do it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.529 
now previously I showed you how to do it
in<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.039> triangular<00:00:29.039> regular<00:00:29.880> shape<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.359> in

in a triangular regular shape and in

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.250 
in a triangular regular shape and in
this<00:00:30.689> shape<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> fit<00:00:32.640> into<00:00:33.260> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this shape it's going to fit into this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.580 
this shape it's going to fit into this
curved<00:00:34.710> shape<00:00:36.050> what<00:00:37.050> you're<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> need

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
curved shape what you're going to need

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.660 
curved shape what you're going to need
is<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:39.110> ruler<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.520> pencil<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.620> eraser<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:46.670> in

is a ruler a pencil and an eraser and in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
is a ruler a pencil and an eraser and in
the<00:00:47.789> next<00:00:48.000> segments<00:00:48.420> we're<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.190> our

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the next segments we're going to use our

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
the next segments we're going to use our
pens<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.940> take<00:00:54.120> your

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
pens what I want you to do is take your

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.580 
pens what I want you to do is take your
ruler<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.969> measure<00:00:56.989> half<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> distance

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
ruler and measure half of the distance

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.450 
ruler and measure half of the distance
from<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.699> arm<00:01:01.460> you'll

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
from here to here on this arm you'll

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
from here to here on this arm you'll
notice<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
notice that this is going to be the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.740 
notice that this is going to be the
access<00:01:05.549> point<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.080> about<00:01:07.170> 4.5<00:01:08.750> 4

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
access point of it so it's about 4.5 4

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:22.460 
access point of it so it's about 4.5 4
so<00:01:11.210> wait.you<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:15.290> rotate<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:18.840> there

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.860 

I<00:01:22.560> don't<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.390> half<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
I don't see what is it half of this

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.870 
I don't see what is it half of this
distance<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.800> about<00:01:25.980> three<00:01:26.190> point<00:01:26.490> four

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
distance is it's about three point four

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.070 
distance is it's about three point four
so<00:01:28.220> point<00:01:29.220> seven<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.360> doing<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.870> down<00:01:34.050> a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
so point seven so it's doing for down a

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.460 
so point seven so it's doing for down a
little<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:36.500> zero<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.390> points<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
little more zero so it's two points so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.690 
little more zero so it's two points so
you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> distance<00:01:41.370> from<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you can see the distance from here to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.660 
you can see the distance from here to
here<00:01:42.140> two<00:01:43.140> point<00:01:43.410> seven<00:01:43.890> divided<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:44.130> two<00:01:44.400> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
here two point seven divided by two is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.930 
here two point seven divided by two is
about<00:01:44.910> one<00:01:45.120> point<00:01:45.300> three<00:01:45.630> five<00:01:46.760> it's<00:01:47.760> about

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
about one point three five it's about

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.840 
about one point three five it's about
there<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:49.040> little<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:54.890> one<00:01:55.890> point<00:01:56.160> seven

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
there a little more so one point seven

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.590 
there a little more so one point seven
five

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
five

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
five
/<00:01:58.380> -<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.729> about<00:02:00.320> eight<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.590> half<00:02:04.040> there

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
/ - it's about eight and a half there

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.389 
/ - it's about eight and a half there
so<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.380> dots<00:02:07.710> here

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so with these little dots here

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.290 
so with these little dots here
I'm<00:02:08.970> watch<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.300> free<00:02:10.020> hand<00:02:10.259> start<00:02:11.130> here<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
I'm watch a free hand start here at the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.910 
I'm watch a free hand start here at the
bottom<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.720> Crescent<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:15.260> light<00:02:16.260> Li

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
bottom of your Crescent and light Li

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.540 
bottom of your Crescent and light Li
score<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.590> halfway<00:02:19.830> mark

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
score the halfway mark

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.970 
score the halfway mark
so<00:02:21.240> you've<00:02:21.390> divided<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> disk<00:02:22.110> based<00:02:22.290> into

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so you've divided the disk based into

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.580 
so you've divided the disk based into
two<00:02:24.770> next<00:02:27.350> just<00:02:28.350> by<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:29.030> figure<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.410> where<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
two next just by I figure out where the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:43.120 
two next just by I figure out where the
halfway<00:02:32.280> point<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.600> this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.300 

triangle

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
triangle

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:54.350 
triangle
Thanks<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:49.489> pick<00:02:51.020> draw<00:02:52.020> some<00:02:52.290> circles<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:54.330> make

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
Thanks so pick draw some circles to make

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.530 
Thanks so pick draw some circles to make
a<00:02:54.720> grid<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.709> you've<00:02:55.860> got<00:02:56.069> some<00:02:56.760> outer<00:02:56.970> circles

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
a grid so you've got some outer circles

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.320 
a grid so you've got some outer circles
here<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:01.110> are<00:03:01.400> what<00:03:02.400> looks<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> be

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
here that are what looks to be

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.320 
here that are what looks to be
equidistant<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.680> corners<00:03:06.140> next<00:03:08.300> put<00:03:09.300> a

to draw a line cuz you're gonna be
drawing<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.170> spine<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.310> trying

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
drawing the spine of this and trying

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.460 
drawing the spine of this and trying
around<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:36.830> that<00:03:37.830> connects<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.280> their<00:03:39.470> draw

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
around it that connects to their draw

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.330 
around it that connects to their draw
another<00:03:40.830> one<00:03:42.349> like<00:03:43.349> so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.050 

next

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.680 

draw<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.840> line<00:03:57.200> like<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.530> and<00:04:01.240> then<00:04:02.240> from<00:04:02.510> this

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
draw a line like this and then from this

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.680 
draw a line like this and then from this
one<00:04:06.370> draw<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.400> mirrored<00:04:07.790> image<00:04:08.030> line<00:04:08.270> like<00:04:08.510> this

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
one draw a mirrored image line like this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:18.180 
one draw a mirrored image line like this
it<00:04:09.230> almost<00:04:09.380> looks<00:04:09.709> like<00:04:09.770> a<00:04:09.890> fly<00:04:10.190> or<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.490> bee

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.300 

this<00:04:18.880> one<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.269> going<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.630> curve<00:04:21.300> down
