00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
said well we got it to a point where we

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.089 
said well we got it to a point where we
thought<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.379> was<00:04:13.470> hard<00:04:13.650> enough<00:04:13.739> then<00:04:13.979> we

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
thought it was hard enough then we

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.860 
thought it was hard enough then we
doubled<00:04:14.400> difficulty<00:04:14.909> of<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.269> we<00:04:15.659> still

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
doubled difficulty of it and we still

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.969 
doubled difficulty of it and we still
have<00:04:16.049> people<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.409> have<00:04:16.500> already<00:04:16.590> killed
