medium for my students my boys teachers

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
medium for my students my boys teachers
so<00:00:32.369> my<00:00:32.460> students<00:00:32.880> were<00:00:33.090> singing<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.930> want

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
somewhere to sing so we started

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
somewhere to sing so we started
Pandora's<00:00:36.270> box<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> course<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> morphed

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
Pandora's box and of course it morphed

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that the the whole thing is reflected as

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.279 
that the the whole thing is reflected as
being<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.580> group<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.090> well<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:16.020> very

talented<00:01:16.619> soloists

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.670 

I<00:01:43.490> think<00:01:44.180> their<00:01:44.660> drive<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.230> the<00:01:45.350> thing<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.650> I

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
I think their drive is the thing that I

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.110 
I think their drive is the thing that I
think<00:01:46.010> makes<00:01:46.160> them<00:01:46.310> unique<00:01:46.610> because<00:01:46.790> they're

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
think makes them unique because they're

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.660 
think makes them unique because they're
all<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.480> type<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:48.470> go-getters<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.610> don't

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
all a type really go-getters and I don't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.610 
all a type really go-getters and I don't
have<00:01:49.910> to<00:01:50.030> really<00:01:50.300> push<00:01:50.690> them<00:01:50.930> they<00:01:51.080> just<00:01:51.470> will

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
have to really push them they just will

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.410 
have to really push them they just will
organize<00:01:52.010> themselves<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.730> put<00:01:53.150> in<00:01:53.240> whatever

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
organize themselves and put in whatever

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.910 
organize themselves and put in whatever
time<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.870> takes<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.380> takes<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.680> lot<00:01:54.800> from

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
time it takes and that takes a lot from

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950 
time it takes and that takes a lot from
a<00:01:55.040> group<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.730> takes<00:01:55.910> hours<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.450> hours<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
quite fanciful I think that the Broadway

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:21.450 
quite fanciful I think that the Broadway
looks<00:03:06.769> great<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.220> kind<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.489> stuff

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.340 

everyone<00:03:22.460> who<00:03:22.550> comes<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.120> box<00:03:23.330> concert<00:03:23.750> I

everyone who comes to a box concert I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.950 
everyone who comes to a box concert I
would<00:03:24.950> say<00:03:25.130> 910<00:03:25.760> people<00:03:26.060> say<00:03:26.210> it<00:03:26.570> was<00:03:26.780> totally

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
would say 910 people say it was totally

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.360 
would say 910 people say it was totally
different<00:03:27.410> than<00:03:27.530> what<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.650> was<00:03:27.770> expecting<00:03:28.280> it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
different than what I was expecting it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.100 
different than what I was expecting it
was<00:03:28.490> totally<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:28.910> always<00:03:29.030> over<00:03:29.450> delivers<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
was totally it always over delivers and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.950 
was totally it always over delivers and
I<00:03:30.170> am<00:03:30.290> very<00:03:30.560> very<00:03:30.590> impressed<00:03:31.100> about<00:03:31.160> that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.690 

we<00:03:36.960> have<00:03:37.050> all<00:03:37.170> sorts<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.470> quirky<00:03:37.800> little<00:03:37.980> turns

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
we have all sorts of quirky little turns

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.660 
we have all sorts of quirky little turns
that<00:03:39.240> we<00:03:39.360> do<00:03:39.540> with<00:03:39.960> our<00:03:40.290> concerts<00:03:40.830> there's<00:03:41.610> a

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that we do with our concerts there's a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.580 
that we do with our concerts there's a
lot<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:41.910> humor<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.360> think<00:03:42.660> had<00:03:42.990> it<00:03:43.020> added<00:03:43.410> with<00:03:43.560> a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
lot of humor I think had it added with a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.920 
lot of humor I think had it added with a
theatrical<00:03:43.890> touch<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.640> think<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.210> it<00:03:45.720> makes

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
theatrical touch I think that it makes

00:03:45.930 --> 00:04:23.920 
theatrical touch I think that it makes
for<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> real<00:03:46.380> fun<00:03:46.620> time

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.270 

well<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:24.960> think<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:25.349> it<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.800> be<00:04:25.889> in<00:04:26.009> the<00:04:26.129> box

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
well I think that it to be in the box

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.010 
well I think that it to be in the box
you<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.610> watch<00:04:26.939> certain<00:04:27.270> things<00:04:27.659> and<00:04:27.960> you

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
you have to watch certain things and you

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.320 
you have to watch certain things and you
have<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.710> want<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.099> end<00:04:29.340> result<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.120> box

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
have to want the end result that the box

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.589 
have to want the end result that the box
can<00:04:30.509> give<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:32.610> everyone<00:04:32.939> is<00:04:33.030> willing<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.389> put

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
can give not everyone is willing to put

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:34.580 
can give not everyone is willing to put
in<00:04:33.689> at<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> time<00:04:34.229> and<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.560> course

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
in at the time and of course

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.899 
in at the time and of course
everything's<00:04:35.069> from<00:04:35.250> memory<00:04:35.550> they<00:04:35.699> have<00:04:35.819> to

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
everything's from memory they have to

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:36.950 
everything's from memory they have to
memorize<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> music<00:04:36.569> but<00:04:36.689> it's<00:04:36.810> also

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
memorize the music but it's also

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.350

choreographed and it's it's done a
theatrical<00:04:39.629> environment<00:04:40.080> most<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.770> time

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
theatrical environment most of the time

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.700 
theatrical environment most of the time
