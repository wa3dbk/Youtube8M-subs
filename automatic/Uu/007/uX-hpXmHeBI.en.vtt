home button and then we will do is it
will<00:01:38.740> be<00:01:38.950> spring<00:01:39.280> your<00:01:39.580> springboard<00:01:40.890> you'll

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
will be spring your springboard you'll

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.419 
will be spring your springboard you'll
see<00:01:42.160> now<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.700> your<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:44.229> your<00:01:45.039> lockscreen

so now if we go into this thing called

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.680 
so now if we go into this thing called
winterboard<00:01:53.380> app<00:01:53.590> you'll<00:01:54.580> see<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.420> gives<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
winterboard app you'll see it it gives a

variety<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.590> things<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.250> use<00:01:57.490> now<00:01:58.390> if

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
variety of things we have to use now if

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.639 
variety of things we have to use now if
we<00:01:58.600> go<00:01:58.750> into<00:01:58.869> this<00:01:59.020> eyeglass<00:01:59.530> soul<00:01:59.860> part<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
we go into this eyeglass soul part it
