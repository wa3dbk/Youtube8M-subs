experience in the pc market in Europe

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.599 
experience in the pc market in Europe
but<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.200> think<00:01:17.530> smartphone<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.280> quite<00:01:18.579> a

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
but I think smartphone is quite a

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.319 
but I think smartphone is quite a
different<00:01:19.420> thing<00:01:20.130> how<00:01:21.130> do<00:01:21.189> you<00:01:21.340> see<00:01:21.639> will<00:01:22.210> it

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
different thing how do you see will it

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.599 
different thing how do you see will it
be<00:01:22.479> a<00:01:22.509> big<00:01:22.719> challenge<00:01:22.899> for<00:01:23.139> lenovo<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:24.100> you

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
be a big challenge for lenovo to you

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:25.830 
be a big challenge for lenovo to you
know<00:01:24.759> success<00:01:25.209> in<00:01:25.359> the<00:01:25.450> european<00:01:25.810> market

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
know success in the european market

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.020 
know success in the european market
because<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:26.590> really<00:01:27.039> different<00:01:27.340> from<00:01:27.850> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
because it's really different from the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.749 
because it's really different from the
nature<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:29.200> well<00:01:29.770> i<00:01:29.799> mean<00:01:30.039> i<00:01:30.159> agree<00:01:30.280> with<00:01:30.579> you

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
nature and well i mean i agree with you

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.309 
nature and well i mean i agree with you
that<00:01:30.789> I<00:01:30.969> think<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.479> there<00:01:31.780> are<00:01:31.810> differences

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
that I think that there are differences

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.190 
that I think that there are differences
between<00:01:32.709> a<00:01:32.920> pc<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:34.299> smartphone<00:01:34.780> but<00:01:34.929> I<00:01:35.049> mean

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
between a pc and a smartphone but I mean

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.349 
between a pc and a smartphone but I mean
our<00:01:35.530> industries<00:01:36.100> are<00:01:36.249> being<00:01:36.399> converging<00:01:36.999> over

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
our industries are being converging over

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.629 
our industries are being converging over
the<00:01:37.479> last<00:01:37.659> few<00:01:37.840> years<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.950> there<00:01:39.369> are<00:01:39.429> a<00:01:39.490> lot<00:01:39.609> of

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
the last few years so there are a lot of

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.029 
the last few years so there are a lot of
similarities<00:01:40.359> as<00:01:40.569> well<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.409> think<00:01:41.679> well

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
similarities as well so I think well

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.410 
similarities as well so I think well
enough<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.520> was<00:01:42.639> in<00:01:42.789> a<00:01:42.880> very<00:01:43.029> very<00:01:43.270> special

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
enough I was in a very very special

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.480 
enough I was in a very very special
situation<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.499> that<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.709> can<00:01:44.829> leverage<00:01:45.100> off

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
situation is that we can leverage off

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.059 
situation is that we can leverage off
the<00:01:45.999> strength<00:01:46.299> that<00:01:46.450> we<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:46.869> from<00:01:47.259> pc<00:01:47.709> and

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
the strength that we have from pc and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.760 
the strength that we have from pc and
the<00:01:48.249> brand<00:01:48.539> we<00:01:49.539> can<00:01:49.689> also<00:01:49.810> leverage<00:01:50.109> off<00:01:50.529> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
the brand we can also leverage off the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.649 
the brand we can also leverage off the
innovation<00:01:51.459> and<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.789> capability<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.599> we

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
innovation and the capability that we

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.230 
innovation and the capability that we
have<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:52.990> pcs<00:01:53.499> and<00:01:53.849> transfer<00:01:54.849> that<00:01:54.880> into

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
have in pcs and transfer that into

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.480 
have in pcs and transfer that into
smartphones<00:01:55.719> place<00:01:56.229> but<00:01:56.889> you<00:01:57.219> know<00:01:57.340> we

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
smartphones place but you know we

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.949 
smartphones place but you know we
recognize<00:01:57.999> is<00:01:58.179> different<00:01:58.539> i<00:01:58.630> mean<00:01:58.810> its

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
recognize is different i mean its

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.870 
recognize is different i mean its
smartphones<00:01:59.950> are<00:02:00.130> more<00:02:00.279> you<00:02:00.520> know<00:02:00.609> more<00:02:00.639> about

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
smartphones are more you know more about

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.179
