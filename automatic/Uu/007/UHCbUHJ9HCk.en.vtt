00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.330
 we are on board rm 12 and 60 of the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.310
 French shipyard forming in a boat 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.070
 for large offshore sailing like 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.200
 we see a very large boat with everyone 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.830
 the canons of the ca de la oceanica boat 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.670
 plus a very particular construction 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.300
 rm are boats made of wood 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.970
 they are all plywood boats 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.620
 plywood then resinated and this gives 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.379
 great advantages from a point of view 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.750
 structural the boat is more rigid and more 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.810
 solid at the same time the artifact 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.850
 breathes so even from the inside the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.850
 boat remains more comfortable 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.210
 also internally the reindeer 12 and 60 e 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.010
 denounces its nature as an ocean boat 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.680
 of the boat made for long 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.670
 navigations we see the decor 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.950
 it is finished and cared for but it is anyway 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.650
 there is nothing superfluous essential 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.170
 precisely because it is designed for one 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.360
 navigation that must last several days 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.050
 in conditions not even particularly 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.050
 easy 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.640
 the boat is structured with three cabins 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.939
 classic a cabin two bow cabin 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.750
 twins aft, one for or for 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.990
 bathroom pass a large kitchen 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.080
 Central to bow away in this area 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.729
 we have the divanry two sofas one of 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.500
 opposite the other a central table 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.759
 suitable for dante raising where it is 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.509
 possible to eat in 56 people 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.509
 interesting also the bunk 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.000
 emergency on the left side above 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.000
 to the back of the sofa
