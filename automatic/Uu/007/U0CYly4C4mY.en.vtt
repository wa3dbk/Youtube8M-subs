00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.150
 hello in this video we will learn to 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.969
 Realize very natural waters 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.730
 refreshing and healthy we are going to 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.549
 need glass container like 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.599
 these can be jams 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.910
 even peanut butter sauces 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.740
 we only wash very well inside and 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.089
 we remove the labels with water and with 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.519
 soap will also be using kiwi I 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.619
 I am using this fruit but you 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.670
 they can use whatever they have in 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:41.860
 your house or your reach like as strawberries 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.860
 berries pineapple watermelon etcetera also 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.609
 we will be using a spoon and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.350
 sugar also ice and natural water 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:56.250
 let's start pouring natural water 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.250
 In a jar 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.610
 I used it up there because we're going to add 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.280
 ice and also the kiwi and then it goes to 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.940
 raise the water and we want it to reach 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.940
 butt we're also going to add the kiwi 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.950
 here we add all point 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 in that way 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:50.110
 already being like this we are going to crush with a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.030
 stick or a kitchen utensil but 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.960
 necessary that this utensil is 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.880
 totally clean since then we are going to 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.119
 take the water 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.090
 so so so until we apachurra 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.539
 stay 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.810
 very dissolved our kiwi in our 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.810
 Water 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.030
 ah 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yes Yes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.110
 it looks strange but at the last one there is a 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.480
 spectacular flavor 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.000
 the most important thing is how is it 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 confusing natural is in the others themselves 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.290
 we do it in our house 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 let's get there 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.140
 at 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.260
 and again like for portugal 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.150
 They can also use or combine routes 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.720
 like blackberries with strawberries with watermelon 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.760
 in the orange with the lemon 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.760
 you can make different combinations 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:33.920
 ready now let's add you should stay 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.920
 well the water and we are going to add ice 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.680
 can use the amount of full 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.680
 that require 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.310
 and finally the sugar 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.920
 I'm just adding 2 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.720
 spoonfuls but you can add 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.720
 the spoons you want 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.580
 and we stir very well 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.340
 here 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.090
 our water is almost ready 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:42.330
 so it ends and to decorate we can put 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.330
 a kiwi 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.300
 and our water is kiwi lists a 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.300
 natural and ready to take
