halogen<00:00:35.790> lights<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> fact<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.440> has<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
halogen lights is the fact that it has a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.560 
halogen lights is the fact that it has a
short<00:00:37.710> life<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.850> between<00:00:39.210> anywhere

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
short life it has between anywhere

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.459 
short life it has between anywhere
between<00:00:39.690> two<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> three<00:00:40.379> thousand<00:00:40.940> hours<00:00:41.940> and

halogens<00:00:43.640> are<00:00:44.640> well<00:00:45.030> known<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.629> not

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
halogens are well known that they do not

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
halogens are well known that they do not
like<00:00:46.110> any<00:00:46.320> type<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> vibration<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> burn

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
like any type of vibration so the burn

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.869 
like any type of vibration so the burn
out<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> vibration<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
out out of vibration so I'm going to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
out out of vibration so I'm going to
turn<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.210> housing<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> show<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
turn this housing on to show you the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
turn this housing on to show you the
brightness<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> 50<00:00:53.460> watt<00:00:53.610> bulb<00:00:53.989> okay<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
brightness of a 50 watt bulb okay and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
brightness of a 50 watt bulb okay and
the<00:00:55.680> new<00:00:55.860> bulb<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.760> today<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> 3

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the new bulb that we have today is a 3

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.490 
the new bulb that we have today is a 3
watt<00:00:57.899> LED<00:00:58.410> lamp<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.309> same<00:00:59.550> base<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.120> g9

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
watt LED lamp in a same base as a g9

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
watt LED lamp in a same base as a g9
okay<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> lamp<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.789> $30,000<00:01:03.719> die<00:01:03.930> for

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
okay and this lamp has a $30,000 die for

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
okay and this lamp has a $30,000 die for
three<00:01:04.439> year<00:01:04.589> warranty<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.189> only<00:01:05.580> consumes

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
three year warranty it only consumes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.170 
three year warranty it only consumes
three<00:01:06.390> watts<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.170> tell<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:08.180> just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
three watts and as you can tell is just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
three watts and as you can tell is just
as<00:01:09.299> bright<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.869> nice<00:01:10.710> part<00:01:10.950> about<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
as bright a nice part about it is that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.149 
as bright a nice part about it is that
it<00:01:11.970> does<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.360> generate<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> heat<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it does not generate a lot of heat it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
it does not generate a lot of heat it
only<00:01:14.460> burns<00:01:14.670> three<00:01:15.000> watts<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.479> has<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> 30,000

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
only burns three watts it has a 30,000

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
only burns three watts it has a 30,000
our<00:01:16.710> life<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.970> mentioned<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
our life like I like I mentioned it is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
our life like I like I mentioned it is
available<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.439> 3000<00:01:20.100> Kelvin<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> nice

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
available in 3000 Kelvin so it is a nice

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.340 
available in 3000 Kelvin so it is a nice
warm<00:01:21.750> creamy<00:01:22.259> color<00:01:22.560> light<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.350> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
warm creamy color light and it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.620 
warm creamy color light and it
illuminates<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.939> challenges<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
illuminates a lot of challenges one of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
illuminates a lot of challenges one of
the<00:01:27.750> biggest<00:01:27.840> challenge<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> find<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the biggest challenge we find with that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
the biggest challenge we find with that
is<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> heat<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.439> generates<00:01:31.920> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
is from the heat that it generates it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.730 
is from the heat that it generates it
burns<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.299> wires<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.409> makes<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
burns out a lot of wires it makes the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.800 
burns out a lot of wires it makes the
wires<00:01:34.920> brittle<00:01:35.420> burns<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.630> through

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
wires brittle burns out through

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.649 
wires brittle burns out through
vibration<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> touch<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
vibration the more you have to touch the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
vibration the more you have to touch the
fixture<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.400> pull<00:01:41.820> out<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
fixture because you have to pull out the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.990 
fixture because you have to pull out the
burn<00:01:42.240> burn<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.689> bulbs<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:44.070> socket<00:01:44.640> keeps<00:01:44.850> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
burn burn out bulbs the socket keeps on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.780 
burn burn out bulbs the socket keeps on
wearing<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> LED<00:01:47.549> bulb

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
wearing out so with with the LED bulb

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.850 
wearing out so with with the LED bulb
you<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> problem<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you don't have that problem because the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
you don't have that problem because the
fact<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.579> thirty<00:01:50.790> thousand<00:01:51.210> our

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
fact that it's a thirty thousand our

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.679 
fact that it's a thirty thousand our
life<00:01:51.570> lamp<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> once<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.970> put<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> will

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
life lamp so once you put it in you will
