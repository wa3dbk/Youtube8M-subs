00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.540
 the singer 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.660
 and now all and well I'm already 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.820
 tiring the voice of so much recording and I already 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.410
 it starts a little throat but only 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.860
 two videos are missing so I do not owe 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.119
 have very well this is something pretty 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.449
 interesting and fun that surely 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.449
 you love them as some 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.090
 you know you can do a TNT cannon 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:40.120
 but you need to 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 how to say obsidian water and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.420
 redstone very well that could be a 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.220
 survival five controls or nothing or what 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.050
 can save with a simple block of 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.080
 commands and a bit of text that I'm going 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.330
 to teach how to do very well here 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.750
 this is the basic command suman prime 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.879
 understand the coordinates that I give them 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.440
 I recommend that no left blank 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.020
 they need to put nothing but if they want 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.220
 you can put something to shoot 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.950
 I know from a do not get clicked and 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.570
 the projectile is going to come out of a cannon that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.820
 on your map adventures and there will be a 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.430
 ship but they are watching from a window 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.410
 where are they going to click the button so 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.290
 you click and from that coordinate 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:29.300
 the shot will come out like that would be a use 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.340
 now this plus that is fuse fuse is the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.070
 time left for them to exploit them 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.500
 I recommend 20 that are more or less two 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.800
 seconds or so three would be three 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.280
 four seconds have four seconds and 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.620
 so not then this of motion would be towards 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.520
 where will it go shooting this is x 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.110
 this is and this is z this I'm not going to 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 modify here but here here arribita 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.160
 we are going to destroy the moon as well as 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.460
 filling in fact not very well this according to 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.710
 my cannon consume and everything according to me and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.759
 well here we can modify everything 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.519
 so that it comes out if she is with -3 because 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.239
 how can they be because x is less 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.920
 towards here if x comes out negative 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.989
 it means that it's valence if it comes out in 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 positive means that it will go towards 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.590
 there if it comes out c is in negative 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.540
 it means that it will go out there and 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.150
 comes out positive means it's going to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.230
 continue there and it was not very clear 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.269
 I know it and it's x zeta 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.670
 and it's the height here I can put it for 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:45.080
 example 10 in motion we put 30 and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.900
 here 4 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.230
 and we can shoot good projectiles from 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.230
 tnt 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.740
 but I do not understand why it does not rise 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.740
 3 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.510
 I do not explain it completely because here 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.330
 had done one up in this role here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.350
 joins and comes out better look more 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.350
 nice has shot I do not explain it very 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.200
 well everything is the same I do not understand why 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.960
 I do not get as good as there to see 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.980
 I copied the command 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.690
 with control to make this better 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.890
 The base command is left by the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.020
 description right now I'm just 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.850
 explaining how to use it so that it does not 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.970
 go kill with him 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.970
 it could be because of this you also see it 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.319
 fire does not come out the same good if it goes 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.989
 right but I do not understand why he does not take 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.290
 consider the height the first value 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.730
 it would be minus 4 that we were going to put 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.610
 negative 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.930
 this is already with more height we are 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.930
 destroying the mountain that 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.640
 very well and to leave a little 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.180
 on the side we're going to put you minus 3 we're not going 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.180
 to put him 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.000
 and 0.5 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:22.139
 and it's going to go that way is the good side would be 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.300
 negative minus 0.5 and so you can 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.410
 go configuring your shots where 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.220
 they want them to go out 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.430
 so we're firing several projectiles 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.630
 As you can see it's very funny, believe me and 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.070
 it can be command to say that this 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.710
 description is already a matter of which 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.750
 you are adjusting with this and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.150
 because this technique cannon the truth is 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.390
 that I love then tides a map of 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.100
 battle of ships or something like that and then 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.720
 well we filled in a following video 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.300
 I have nothing left for a video by luck 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.280
 Well, it hurts me to talk and good 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.290
 we see in a following video up to asylum 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.630
 forget forgotten the broken mind I 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.950
 same twice but good here abajito 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.740
 comes out 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.500
 the videos that I will upload with a 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.710
 small image below similar to this one 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.140
 you do not click and will take them 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.420
 the video just comes with the name very 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.710
 well now if not sir be a next 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.130
 video until next time 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.130
 goodbye
