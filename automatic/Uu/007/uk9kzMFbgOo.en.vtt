my opinion now I have yet to play the

my opinion now I have yet to play the
ps1<00:02:25.080> version<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.769> this<00:02:25.890> game<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.850> suspect

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
ps1 version of this game and I suspect

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.330 
ps1 version of this game and I suspect
it<00:02:27.420> may<00:02:27.540> play<00:02:27.810> significantly<00:02:28.709> differently

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
it may play significantly differently

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.490 
it may play significantly differently
than<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:29.970> because<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> Sega<00:02:31.260> Saturn

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
than this one because in the Sega Saturn

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.890 
than this one because in the Sega Saturn
version<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:33.060> almost<00:02:33.269> feels<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:33.690> your

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
version it almost feels like your

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.840 
version it almost feels like your
character<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.440> leaving<00:02:34.860> underwater<00:02:35.519> or

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
character is leaving underwater or

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.020 
character is leaving underwater or
through<00:02:36.420> some<00:02:36.690> type<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.959> fluid<00:02:37.830> or<00:02:38.220> dense<00:02:38.700> gas

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
through some type of fluid or dense gas

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.120 
through some type of fluid or dense gas
because

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
because

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.910 
because
just<00:02:41.490> moves<00:02:41.700> extremely<00:02:42.450> slow<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.680> almost

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
just moves extremely slow and it almost

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.550 
just moves extremely slow and it almost
feels<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.730> there's<00:02:45.420> added<00:02:45.900> weight<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.170> your

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
feels like there's added weight to your

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
character like it they can't get out of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.780 
character like it they can't get out of
their<00:02:49.020> own<00:02:49.170> way<00:02:49.470> almost<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.950> as<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.610> play<00:02:53.760> the

in with a big pile of Sega Saturn games
I<00:05:37.669> didn't<00:05:38.630> know<00:05:38.719> much<00:05:38.870> about<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.229> series<00:05:39.590> I

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
I didn't know much about the series I

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.010 
I didn't know much about the series I
had<00:05:40.219> heard<00:05:40.430> of<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.610> but<00:05:41.060> hadn't<00:05:41.539> really<00:05:41.780> played

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
had heard of it but hadn't really played

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.570 
had heard of it but hadn't really played
it<00:05:42.199> too<00:05:42.500> much<00:05:43.190> back<00:05:43.550> in<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.789> day<00:05:44.710> in<00:05:45.710> fact<00:05:45.949> by

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
it too much back in the day in fact by

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.450 
it too much back in the day in fact by
not<00:05:46.789> too<00:05:46.940> much<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.240> mean<00:05:47.360> not<00:05:47.599> at<00:05:47.719> all<00:05:48.340> but<00:05:49.340> I<00:05:49.370> was

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
not too much I mean not at all but I was

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.939 
not too much I mean not at all but I was
aware<00:05:49.880> of<00:05:49.909> this<00:05:50.120> series<00:05:50.539> in<00:05:50.719> some<00:05:51.020> ancillary

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
aware of this series in some ancillary

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.219 
aware of this series in some ancillary
way<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:53.150> I<00:05:53.180> was<00:05:53.330> kind<00:05:53.539> of<00:05:53.569> curious<00:05:53.779> to<00:05:53.990> see<00:05:54.050> what

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229
