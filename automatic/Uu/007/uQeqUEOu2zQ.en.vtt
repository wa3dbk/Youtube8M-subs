00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.710
 once a manager who was reputed to be very serious 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 he turned 100 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.350
 the event was received with great joy since everyone loved their 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.620
 voice 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.290
 in the palace a great party was organized so that at night and they were 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.290
 invited by the tower roceÃ±os at airports 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.860
 the day of the birthday arrived a mountain of gifts piled into the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 entrance of the hall with the maharaja was going to greet his guests 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.150
 during the dinner the monarch asked his clients to separate the gifts in 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.870
 two groups 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.579
 those who had a sender and those who did not know who knows 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.340
 to desserts tremendous to have all the gifts are two worlds 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.110
 one of hundreds of large and expensive gifts 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.479
 and another smaller one with only a few dozen presidents 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 in decks began to open the gifts of the first world and was calling 15 the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.210
 leases 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.410
 to each one and so assume the throne and said I thank you for your gift 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.340
 of the flights and we are as before 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.799
 and having said that he returned the gift no matter what it is when he finished with the 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.520
 first heap and returned every day he approached the second mountain 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.290
 these gifts 5 these are the ones that have no sender 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.020
 and for that reason they do not force me to marc 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.710
 can no longer backlight 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.790
 the floods in india 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 you can have your spirit or in the one of the other transforms of sedar 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.119
 if it were like that 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.039
 I think it's better not to say anything 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.969
 if you are able to give without waiting for payments 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.699
 without feeling obligations then 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.060
 can give or not received not 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.169
 but never 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.839
 Remains pending 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:30.829
 and most importantly, no one will ever stop paying but because you 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.129
 never anyone 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.549
 you should never win 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.459
 when Jorge finished speaking 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.499
 nor bad mood had disappeared 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.409
 I realized that I had no obligation to take the notes to 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.469
 my friend 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.199
 I realized that Juan had given me his help without expecting anything 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.809
 change 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:55.219
 and even more so if he had done it so that I owed him something was a mean guy and I 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.169
 I did not want to do favors 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 that way he owed nothing and could do what he wanted 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:03.359
 so I kissed Jorge 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.549
 and I went to take the notes to play
