 from Toyota this Japanese brand has achieved 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.020
 a solid fusion with our 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.199

 making cars this company carried the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.390
 the sales manager of the company 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:01.460
 shotaro stretcher who argued the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.000
 need to find a new logo 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.630
 to attract more car customers is 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 they received in total approximately 27 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.689
 thousand ideas 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 the winning design was a logo that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.990
 incorporated the name 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 Toyoda written horizontally 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.390
 inside a circle the name of the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.789
 company also needed a change and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.820
 was a relative of the president of the 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.590
 company who insisted on changing the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.979
 toyota name 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.189
 the reason the number of characters 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.969
 Japanese to write toyota were 8 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.520
 number considered good luck 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.850
 besides this word in Japanese does not have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.310
 meaning unlike toyota then 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 the family was wondering why to call 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.459
 to a fertile rice field car outside 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.789

 in 1989 the logo of toyota is introduced

 with a somewhat odd design however 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 these three intercepting ellipses 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.140
 represent the heart of toyota the

 relationship between the Japanese brand of 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:51.180

 Blank background represents the desire 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.519
