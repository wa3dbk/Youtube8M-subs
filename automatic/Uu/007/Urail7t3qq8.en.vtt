this is a part two of growing quinoa I

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.669 
this is a part two of growing quinoa I
want<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> give<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.870> guys<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> little<00:00:10.139> update<00:00:10.320> on

how it's doing it's been about a month
since<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> last<00:00:13.320> video<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.460> mean<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> can

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
since the last video and I mean you can

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.369 
since the last video and I mean you can
see<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> quinoa<00:00:15.719> plant<00:00:15.960> right<00:00:16.199> here

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
see this is the quinoa plant right here

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.880 
see this is the quinoa plant right here
I<00:00:16.410> mean<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:17.070> sprouted<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.550> really<00:00:17.789> tall

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
I mean it really sprouted up really tall

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.230 
I mean it really sprouted up really tall
I'd<00:00:19.890> probably<00:00:20.070> say<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.460> almost<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.910> it's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
I'd probably say it's almost about it's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.460 
I'd probably say it's almost about it's
about<00:00:21.359> two<00:00:21.570> feet<00:00:21.750> tall<00:00:21.810> right<00:00:22.170> now

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
about two feet tall right now

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.400 
about two feet tall right now
and<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:24.300> flower<00:00:24.900> heads<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.320> actually

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and this flower heads are actually

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
and this flower heads are actually
getting<00:00:25.740> pretty<00:00:25.830> big<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.640> seeds

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
getting pretty big on there the seeds

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580 
getting pretty big on there the seeds
are<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
are actually in there and this is

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
are actually in there and this is
actually<00:00:29.160> red<00:00:29.400> quinoa<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:30.539> seed<00:00:30.840> heads

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
actually red quinoa so these seed heads

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
actually red quinoa so these seed heads
actually<00:00:31.439> should<00:00:31.619> should<00:00:31.920> start<00:00:32.160> turning<00:00:32.489> red

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
actually should should start turning red

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.860 
actually should should start turning red
right<00:00:32.910> when<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.300> ready<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.840> can

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
right when they're about ready and I can

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.350 
right when they're about ready and I can
kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:36.090> well

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
kind of see it a little bit now well

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.020 
kind of see it a little bit now well
everything<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.500> plant<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.010> edible<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
everything on this plant is edible the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.590 
everything on this plant is edible the
leaves<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> stems<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.520> flower<00:00:41.850> heads<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
leaves the stems the flower heads the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
leaves the stems the flower heads the
seeds<00:00:42.899> everything<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.610> almost<00:00:45.300> hate<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> do

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
seeds everything and I almost hate to do

00:00:45.840 --> 00:01:05.090 
seeds everything and I almost hate to do
this<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> wondering<00:01:03.920> yeah<00:01:04.920> this

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this but I'm kind of wondering yeah this

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.770 
this but I'm kind of wondering yeah this
is<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.339> big<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is how big it is right here now the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.719 
is how big it is right here now the
bottom<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.890> actually<00:01:08.189> starting<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.520> lose

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
bottom it's actually starting to lose

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.780 
bottom it's actually starting to lose
the<00:01:08.909> leaves<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> bottom<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.860> heard

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the leaves on the bottom and I heard

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.160 
the leaves on the bottom and I heard
boom<00:01:11.939> quinoa<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.750> ready<00:01:12.960> it'll

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
boom quinoa is just about ready it'll

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
boom quinoa is just about ready it'll
start<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> lose<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> leaves<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
start to lose the leaves and that's the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.850 
start to lose the leaves and that's the
reason<00:01:15.540> why<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.140> focuses<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.710> its

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
reason why is because it focuses all its

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
reason why is because it focuses all its
energy<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.610> seed<00:01:18.090> heads<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> flowers

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
energy on the seed heads and the flowers

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.340 
energy on the seed heads and the flowers
and<00:01:19.520> reproduce<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> basically<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and reproduce it basically I want to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.480 
and reproduce it basically I want to
give<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> guys<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> close-up<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
give you guys a close-up of what it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
give you guys a close-up of what it
looks<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.759> now<00:01:24.570> here's<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> seed

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
looks like now here's what the seed

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.249 
looks like now here's what the seed
heads<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.659> sorry<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> winds<00:01:27.990> blowing

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
heads look like sorry the winds blowing

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
heads look like sorry the winds blowing
a<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:28.470> bit<00:01:28.680> I'll<00:01:28.770> try<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> stabilize<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a little bit I'll try to stabilize the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.840 
a little bit I'll try to stabilize the
plant<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> see

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
plant so you can see it and you can see

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
plant so you can see it and you can see
the<00:01:32.970> seed<00:01:33.240> heads

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the seed heads

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.740 
the seed heads
and<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.790> starting<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.150> lose<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.540> leaves

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
and it is starting to lose the leaves

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.330 
and it is starting to lose the leaves
right<00:01:38.050> down<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:38.470> on<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.680> bottom<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:39.190> a

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
right down here on the bottom just a

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.990 
right down here on the bottom just a
little<00:01:39.580> bit<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.430> reason<00:01:42.580> why<00:01:42.820> is<00:01:42.880> because

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
little bit and the reason why is because

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.570 
little bit and the reason why is because
as<00:01:43.420> they<00:01:43.570> get<00:01:43.690> bigger<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:45.070> focus<00:01:45.400> all<00:01:45.550> our

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
as they get bigger they focus all our

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.820 
as they get bigger they focus all our
energy<00:01:45.730> on<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.120> flowers<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.780> they<00:01:47.440> start<00:01:47.740> to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
energy on the flowers and they start to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.740 
energy on the flowers and they start to
lose<00:01:47.950> all<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.190> leaves<00:01:48.370> now<00:01:49.120> you<00:01:49.210> can<00:01:49.510> grow

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
lose all the leaves now you can grow

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.040 
lose all the leaves now you can grow
this<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.320> for<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.880> for<00:01:52.060> eating<00:01:52.210> us<00:01:52.450> lettuce

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
this just for just for eating us lettuce

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.990 
this just for just for eating us lettuce
or<00:01:53.200> spinach<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.460> kind<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.670> start<00:01:54.820> you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
or spinach you just kind of start you

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.310 
or spinach you just kind of start you
harvest<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.450> right<00:01:55.600> when<00:01:55.750> it's<00:01:55.870> about<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.050> foot

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
harvest it right when it's about a foot

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.370 
harvest it right when it's about a foot
tall<00:01:56.610> before<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.670> goes<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:58.000> flower<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:02.229> gonna

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
tall before it goes to flower I'm gonna

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.310 
tall before it goes to flower I'm gonna
actually<00:02:02.740> planted<00:02:03.280> some<00:02:03.430> over<00:02:03.670> here<00:02:03.700> too<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
actually planted some over here too the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
they look like in the Sun and you can

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.680 
they look like in the Sun and you can
see<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.530> crystals<00:02:12.040> actually<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.480> seed

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
see the crystals actually on the seed

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.740 
see the crystals actually on the seed
heads<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.640> those<00:02:15.790> crystals<00:02:16.300> are<00:02:16.360> actually

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
heads and those crystals are actually

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.000 
heads and those crystals are actually
calcium<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:20.080> these<00:02:20.200> plants<00:02:20.620> here<00:02:20.740> they're<00:02:20.980> I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
calcium so these plants here they're I

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.170 
calcium so these plants here they're I
mean<00:02:21.220> they're<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.370> loaded<00:02:21.700> with<00:02:21.850> good<00:02:22.150> stuff

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.899 

all<00:02:26.689> right<00:02:26.810> guys<00:02:27.340> now<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.519> pretty<00:02:28.730> much

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
all right guys now that's pretty much

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.160 
all right guys now that's pretty much
everything<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.329> found<00:02:29.510> out<00:02:29.689> about<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.019> quinoa

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
everything I found out about the quinoa

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.789 
everything I found out about the quinoa
so<00:02:30.470> far<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> cold<00:02:32.209> weather<00:02:32.420> plan<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
so far it is a cold weather plan the

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.530 
so far it is a cold weather plan the
best<00:02:33.980> time<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.400> harvest<00:02:34.579> this<00:02:34.970> thing<00:02:35.269> I

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
best time to harvest this thing I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.630 
best time to harvest this thing I
actually<00:02:36.290> de<00:02:36.379> plan<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.890> actually<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.459> to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
actually de plan it actually is to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.490 
actually de plan it actually is to
either<00:02:37.760> plant<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.360> fall<00:02:38.420> season<00:02:38.840> or

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
either plant it in the fall season or

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.339 
either plant it in the fall season or
early<00:02:39.890> early<00:02:40.159> early<00:02:40.220> spring<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:41.230> think<00:02:42.230> what

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
early early early spring I think what

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.270 
early early early spring I think what
you<00:02:42.439> could<00:02:42.560> probably<00:02:42.680> do<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.159> could

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you could probably do is you could

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.069 
you could probably do is you could
actually<00:02:43.340> meet<00:02:43.849> time<00:02:44.000> after<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.359> winter

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
actually meet time after the winter

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.009 
actually meet time after the winter
solstice<00:02:45.349> after<00:02:45.980> December<00:02:46.340> 22nd<00:02:46.879> of<00:02:47.629> any<00:02:47.780> year

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
solstice after December 22nd of any year

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.020 
solstice after December 22nd of any year
you<00:02:48.709> actually<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.220> spread<00:02:49.430> some<00:02:49.459> seeds<00:02:49.849> out

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
you actually just spread some seeds out

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.190 
you actually just spread some seeds out
there<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.420> they'll<00:02:50.540> actually<00:02:50.659> grow<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.079> on

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
there and they'll actually grow up on

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.229 
there and they'll actually grow up on
their<00:02:51.319> own<00:02:51.409> when<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.709> time<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.010> good<00:02:52.159> and<00:02:53.000> just

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
their own when the time is good and just

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.220 
their own when the time is good and just
kind<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.420> let<00:02:53.540> nature<00:02:53.750> do<00:02:53.959> its<00:02:53.989> own<00:02:54.200> thing<00:02:56.230> so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
kind of let nature do its own thing so

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.700 
kind of let nature do its own thing so
that's<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.220> thanks<00:02:58.519> for<00:02:58.639> watching
