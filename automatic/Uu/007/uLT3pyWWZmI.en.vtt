00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hello, I was in contact with violet 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.849
 Today we have the third video about how 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 grow a lotus seed one of the most 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.160
 responsible so how are we going 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 transplant 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.130
 lotuses from their temporary storage there 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 where not constantly germinated constantly 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.240
 the vault will look like sees vessels 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.359
 one will be the ground 2 soaps of us 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.750
 the aquarium was found home and we will 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.110
 immerse the grain first in the ground and then 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.230
 capacity ground into the aquarium so you see 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.450
 in two weeks the lotus grow is already very 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 big they absolutely do not fit in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.440
 container 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 here I left the weakest 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.780
 of which versions are the smallest 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.830
 the biggest active 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.900
 look at their roots 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.040
 wonderful already evolved of course 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.580
 requires that they be planted some even 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.739
 already started to open the first leaf 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.140
 I remind you that from the moment I went down 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.020
 they need sprouting exactly two passed 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.320
 weeks and in fact now we will 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 But if our plant in a container with 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.479
 I poured a layer of earth on one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 sand approximately one centimeter to the ground 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:32.759
 made a mixture of empty land which in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.729
 which is planted with raccoon cacti and I do not know 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.399
 right there is no but so decided 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.719
 do I actually plant seeds 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.450
 tits will be planted 7 pieces probably 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:49.079
 for them it will be cramped of course well 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.530
 we have to endure with them until July 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.539
 because let's say June probably because 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.929
 the optimum water temperature at which 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.090
 the growth of the globe to 25-30 degrees but 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.040
 before June it is not likely to wait 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 worth it and then I'll land 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.180
 in the open air probably something like that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 I will bury them now I will plant everything 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.920
 nine seeds and continue to plant here 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.000
 seeds included 7 seeds in this pot 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.050
 now we transfer it to the aquarium of course 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.050
 a small one was formed 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.230
 even in my place will be small and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.570
 hold on till june will anything 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:45.950
 think of a transplant while pouring so 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:49.730
 so burrowed leaf and begin to slowly 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.730
 fill the aquarium with water 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:59.880
 shake and dolim the rest 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.850
 ugliness we have a pot 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.860
 placed in an aquarium and not to pop up 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.530
 Of course it would be desirable to impose all 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.440
 stones or ugly that found the houses we 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.050
 survived which particles I 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.040
 I think that everything will sit down now the most important thing 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:24.000
 so that the lotuses raised their leaves above 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.489
 water so they like here they intermeddle here in 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.510
 tom container where germination but there 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.299
 adapt 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.780
 everything should be fine water level i 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:38.370
 measured by a small leaf so that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.250
 they were over water too 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.530
 I'll get them good because one 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.900
 I have already rotten leaf 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.200
 just for not 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.439
 could break through to the surface now 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.870
 we put the aquarium on the windowsill 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.989
 sunny lotuses are very fond of the sun 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.060
 many well and we expect that there will be well with 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.359
 the moment we planted our seeds 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.340
 It took exactly two days and you can see that 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.319
 it's really real though 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.730
 little lotus and steel leaves 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.980
 unfold they find the surface and 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:17.150
 already in such a beautiful aquarium 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.820
 we get subscribe to the channel 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.410
 and the next video will probably be about 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.410
 how found before bloom
