to have an all new hello kitty series at

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.129 
to have an all new hello kitty series at
sephora<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> they<00:00:11.910> had<00:00:12.150> an<00:00:12.300> old<00:00:12.540> one<00:00:12.750> before

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
sephora and they had an old one before

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.629 
sephora and they had an old one before
and<00:00:13.170> i<00:00:13.320> think<00:00:13.530> i<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.830> really<00:00:14.040> old<00:00:14.370> video

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and i think i have a really old video

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.930 
and i think i have a really old video
about<00:00:15.179> some<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> products<00:00:16.230> i<00:00:16.410> bought<00:00:16.650> um

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
about some of the products i bought um

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.720 
about some of the products i bought um
but<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.619> kind<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.680> feel<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:19.890> maybe<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
but I kind of feel like maybe some of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.090 
but I kind of feel like maybe some of
the<00:00:20.789> products<00:00:21.180> weren't<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.720> high<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.050> high<00:00:22.949> of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the products weren't as high as high of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640 
the products weren't as high as high of
quality<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.510> sold<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.109> kind<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> high

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
quality and they sold for kind of high

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.640 
quality and they sold for kind of high
prices<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.000> had<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> lot<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> products<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
prices so I had a lot of products that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.400 
prices so I had a lot of products that
actually<00:00:28.800> liked<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.580> collection<00:00:30.410> but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
actually liked from that collection but

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.880 
actually liked from that collection but
i<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.650> their<00:00:32.070> new<00:00:32.279> collection<00:00:32.969> i'm

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
i do think their new collection i'm

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.350 
i do think their new collection i'm
assuming<00:00:34.890> probably<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.640> quality<00:00:36.149> will<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
assuming probably the quality will be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
assuming probably the quality will be
higher<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> better<00:00:37.739> than<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.280> one

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
higher and better than the first one

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
higher and better than the first one
because<00:00:38.850> i<00:00:39.030> noticed<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.690> those<00:00:39.899> old

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
because i noticed that all those old

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.619 
because i noticed that all those old
things<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:40.829> those<00:00:41.610> old<00:00:41.820> products<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.480> either

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
definitely different than the compact

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
definitely different than the compact

at one I actually bought the old one and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.539 
at one I actually bought the old one and
I<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> say<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.950> mean<00:01:17.220> there's<00:01:17.369> nothing

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
I have to say I mean there's nothing

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
I have to say I mean there's nothing
wrong<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.390> fact<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.200> looking<00:01:19.500> at

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
wrong with this fact I'm just looking at

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
wrong with this fact I'm just looking at
a<00:01:19.650> picture<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.159> their<00:01:20.340> website<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
a picture on their website and what I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
a picture on their website and what I
look<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> inside<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.580> much<00:01:23.790> looks

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
look at the inside it pretty much looks

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.550 
look at the inside it pretty much looks
exactly<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.290> same<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.890> mine<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
exactly the same as mine so I kind of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
exactly the same as mine so I kind of
think<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> same<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.180> outside

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
think it's the same one it just outside

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.530 
think it's the same one it just outside
has<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.890> rhinestones<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> does<00:01:33.360> look

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
has the rhinestones and it does look

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
has the rhinestones and it does look
pretty<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pretty so you can look at that and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.520 
pretty so you can look at that and
that's<00:01:35.850> priced<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.360> forty<00:01:36.780> nine<00:01:36.960> dollars<00:01:36.990> so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that's priced at forty nine dollars so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.219 
that's priced at forty nine dollars so
it's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.070> high<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.990> got

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it's a little bit high I think I got

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
it's a little bit high I think I got
this<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> collection<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.299> came

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this in a like a collection and it came

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
this in a like a collection and it came
with<00:01:43.009> nail<00:01:44.009> polish<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.460> stuff<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.340> wasn't

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
with nail polish and stuff so it wasn't

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
with nail polish and stuff so it wasn't
that<00:01:47.729> expensive<00:01:47.939> i<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.720> pay<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.079> much

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that expensive i do not pay that much

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.520 
that expensive i do not pay that much
for<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.790> second<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.990> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
for it and then the second one is this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.760 
for it and then the second one is this
eyeshadow<00:01:53.399> palette<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:55.590> $52<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.770> the

in my purse because i was using it and I

it's<00:03:31.750> great<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.200> travel<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:33.010> definitely

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
it's great for travel but definitely

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.759 
it's great for travel but definitely
this<00:03:34.090> thing<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.420> moves<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.049> not<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.500> great

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
this thing that moves is not that great

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.699 
this thing that moves is not that great
of<00:03:35.829> quality<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.230> would<00:03:38.650> be

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
of quality so I think that would be

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.159 
of quality so I think that would be
improved<00:03:39.310> hopefully<00:03:40.269> if<00:03:40.420> they<00:03:40.599> ever<00:03:40.720> come<00:03:41.019> out

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
improved hopefully if they ever come out

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.559 
improved hopefully if they ever come out
with<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.440> again<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.579> it<00:03:42.849> works<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.419> doesn't

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
with this again but it works it doesn't

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.449 
with this again but it works it doesn't
break<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.079> don't<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.349> a<00:03:44.440> problem<00:03:44.680> with<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:44.980> and
