just a little hole for the base like you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.410 
just a little hole for the base like you
know<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.500> air<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.070> come<00:02:57.220> out<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.580> one<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.180> is

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
know the air to come out of one this is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.000 
know the air to come out of one this is
getting<00:02:58.840> pretty<00:02:59.290> loud<00:02:59.530> then<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.860> air<00:02:59.980> will

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
getting pretty loud then the air will

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.070 
getting pretty loud then the air will
start<00:03:00.220> coming<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.819> on<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.750> bottom<00:03:02.019> we

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
start coming on to that on the bottom we

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
portable and it stays in there so you're

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.309 
portable and it stays in there so you're
not<00:03:16.330> gonna<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.660> worry<00:03:16.810> about<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.170> wire

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
not gonna have to worry about the wire

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.750 
not gonna have to worry about the wire
like<00:03:17.530> tangling<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.130> or<00:03:18.280> anything<00:03:18.459> like<00:03:18.700> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
like tangling up or anything like that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.670 
like tangling up or anything like that
since<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.690> always<00:03:19.840> gonna<00:03:20.049> be<00:03:20.260> with<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
since it's always gonna be with the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.650 
since it's always gonna be with the
speaker<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.610> that's<00:03:21.790> really<00:03:22.090> cool<00:03:22.329> we<00:03:22.540> also

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
speaker so that's really cool we also

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.789 
speaker so that's really cool we also
have<00:03:22.840> rubber<00:03:23.019> feet<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.410> bottom<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.769> that

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
have rubber feet on the bottom so that

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.550 
have rubber feet on the bottom so that
it<00:03:23.980> doesn't<00:03:24.160> scratch<00:03:24.400> your<00:03:24.610> table<00:03:25.290> now<00:03:26.290> what<00:03:26.530> I

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
it doesn't scratch your table now what I

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.289 
it doesn't scratch your table now what I
was<00:03:26.709> saying<00:03:26.890> about<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.160> top<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.670> if<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.000> twist

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
was saying about the top is if you twist

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.630 
was saying about the top is if you twist
right<00:03:28.450> here<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.870> base<00:03:29.440> chamber<00:03:29.920> will<00:03:30.190> come<00:03:30.430> out

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
right here a base chamber will come out

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.670 
right here a base chamber will come out
on<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.480> just<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:31.930> extend<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.530> base

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
on this is to just like extend the base

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.350 
on this is to just like extend the base
and<00:03:32.920> make<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.160> louder<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.760> boost<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.120> base

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
and make it louder is to boost the base

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.870 
and make it louder is to boost the base
basically<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.250> but<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.340> sounds<00:03:36.610> pretty<00:03:36.640> good

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
basically like but it sounds pretty good

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.970 
basically like but it sounds pretty good
when<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.269> open<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.630> up<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.680> basic

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
when you open it up like this the basic

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.319 
when you open it up like this the basic
it's<00:03:39.130> much<00:03:39.280> louder<00:03:39.549> than<00:03:39.670> when<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:40.209> like

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
it's much louder than when it's like

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.990 
it's much louder than when it's like
this<00:03:40.570> but<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.010> sort<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.489> standard<00:03:42.880> on

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
this but this is sort of standard on

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.880 
this but this is sort of standard on
most<00:03:43.030> portable<00:03:43.840> speakers<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:44.650> they

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
most portable speakers like this they

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.830 
most portable speakers like this they
almost<00:03:45.190> all<00:03:45.790> have<00:03:46.030> bass<00:03:46.269> chambers<00:03:46.720> right

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
almost all have bass chambers right

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.509 
almost all have bass chambers right
there<00:03:47.049> but<00:03:47.530> you'll<00:03:47.680> see<00:03:47.829> my<00:03:47.980> thoughts<00:03:48.400> in<00:03:48.489> a

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
there but you'll see my thoughts in a

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.340 
there but you'll see my thoughts in a
few<00:03:48.700> minutes<00:03:48.970> about<00:03:49.060> how<00:03:49.359> these<00:03:49.570> size<00:03:49.900> up<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
few minutes about how these size up to

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.039 
few minutes about how these size up to
the<00:03:50.530> competitors<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.790> $40<00:03:52.480> for<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:52.840> one

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
the competitors it is $40 for just one

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.900 
the competitors it is $40 for just one
or<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.799> pick<00:03:53.920> all<00:03:54.130> three<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.519> these<00:03:54.700> up

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
or you can pick all three of these up

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.860 
or you can pick all three of these up
for<00:03:55.530> $99<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:58.030> really<00:03:58.329> cool<00:03:58.510> design<00:03:58.690> I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
for $99 but it's a really cool design I

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.539 
for $99 but it's a really cool design I
think<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.350> definitely<00:03:59.500> looks<00:03:59.920> really<00:04:00.340> really

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
think it definitely looks really really

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.370 
think it definitely looks really really
snazzy<00:04:00.790> alright<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:01.690> let's<00:04:01.870> talk<00:04:01.959> about<00:04:02.230> some

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
snazzy alright so let's talk about some

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.870 
snazzy alright so let's talk about some
of<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.530> specs<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.950> these<00:04:03.190> speakers<00:04:03.459> right

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
of the specs of these speakers right

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.699 
of the specs of these speakers right
here<00:04:04.209> they<00:04:04.329> do<00:04:04.390> feature<00:04:04.840> good<00:04:04.989> specs<00:04:05.290> actually

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
here they do feature good specs actually

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.710 
here they do feature good specs actually
um<00:04:05.890> they're<00:04:06.130> very<00:04:06.310> small<00:04:06.609> they're<00:04:06.850> about<00:04:07.420> a

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
um they're very small they're about a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.750 
um they're very small they're about a
sixty<00:04:08.290> eight<00:04:08.380> point<00:04:08.620> five<00:04:08.890> millimeters<00:04:09.549> wide

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
sixty eight point five millimeters wide

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.210 
sixty eight point five millimeters wide
and<00:04:10.150> also<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.290> know<00:04:11.380> like<00:04:11.590> tall<00:04:11.829> or<00:04:11.980> whatever

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
and also you know like tall or whatever

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.400 
and also you know like tall or whatever
and<00:04:12.430> then<00:04:12.519> 42<00:04:13.090> millimeters<00:04:13.690> tall<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.260> they're

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
and then 42 millimeters tall so they're

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.920 
and then 42 millimeters tall so they're
sixty<00:04:15.160> eight<00:04:15.280> point<00:04:15.700> five<00:04:15.940> millimeters<00:04:16.539> sixty

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
sixty eight point five millimeters sixty

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.300 
sixty eight point five millimeters sixty
eight<00:04:17.019> point<00:04:17.200> five<00:04:17.350> million<00:04:17.709> years<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.130> then

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
eight point five million years and then

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.490 
eight point five million years and then
forty<00:04:18.640> two<00:04:19.140> millimeters<00:04:20.140> when<00:04:20.320> they're

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
forty two millimeters when they're

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.200 
forty two millimeters when they're
closed<00:04:20.859> when<00:04:21.519> they're<00:04:21.640> open<00:04:21.760> they're<00:04:22.000> just

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
closed when they're open they're just

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.089 
closed when they're open they're just
like<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.360> tiny<00:04:22.690> bit<00:04:22.900> bigger<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:23.680> too<00:04:23.919> much

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
like a tiny bit bigger but not too much

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.529 
like a tiny bit bigger but not too much

get louder than my bookshelf speakers
that<00:07:25.939> I<00:07:25.969> have<00:07:26.180> and<00:07:26.360> they<00:07:26.419> sound<00:07:26.659> a<00:07:26.749> little<00:07:26.930> bit

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
that I have and they sound a little bit

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.170 
that I have and they sound a little bit
better<00:07:27.229> also<00:07:27.610> like<00:07:28.610> when<00:07:28.759> they're<00:07:28.879> daisy

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
better also like when they're daisy

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.779 
better also like when they're daisy
chained<00:07:29.509> together<00:07:29.659> um<00:07:30.339> when<00:07:31.339> one<00:07:31.580> of<00:07:31.669> them

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:31.789 
chained together um when one of them

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:33.189 
chained together um when one of them
that's<00:07:31.969> hooked<00:07:32.120> up<00:07:32.240> it<00:07:32.389> doesn't<00:07:32.629> get<00:07:32.719> as<00:07:32.899> loud

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
that's hooked up it doesn't get as loud

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.659 
that's hooked up it doesn't get as loud
but<00:07:33.499> still<00:07:33.709> gets<00:07:33.860> pretty<00:07:34.069> loud<00:07:34.249> and<00:07:34.309> it<00:07:34.490> does

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:34.669 
but still gets pretty loud and it does

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.149 
but still gets pretty loud and it does
sound<00:07:34.909> good<00:07:35.120> I<00:07:35.870> do<00:07:36.169> think<00:07:36.680> they<00:07:36.800> don't<00:07:36.979> sound

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:37.159 
sound good I do think they don't sound

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.679 
sound good I do think they don't sound
as<00:07:37.339> good<00:07:37.370> without<00:07:37.699> the<00:07:37.999> bass<00:07:38.180> chamber<00:07:38.539> being

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:38.689 
as good without the bass chamber being

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:40.929 
as good without the bass chamber being
extended<00:07:39.139> that's<00:07:39.469> just<00:07:39.680> my<00:07:39.830> opinion<00:07:39.979> but<00:07:40.879> I

00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:40.939 
extended that's just my opinion but I

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.579 
extended that's just my opinion but I
think<00:07:40.999> that<00:07:41.300> these<00:07:41.419> are<00:07:41.599> very<00:07:41.930> very<00:07:42.199> solid

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:42.589 
think that these are very very solid

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.469 
think that these are very very solid
