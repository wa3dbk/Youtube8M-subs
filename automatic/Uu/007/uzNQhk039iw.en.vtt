00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:05.070
 to me 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.099
 for me 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.099
 to me 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.160
 Y 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.340
 hello that such good kids I'm trenzano 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.490
 corporation and today I bring you a new 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.050
 trick here come in if I agree because 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.489
 many of you were asking me 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.379
 that if I was not going to upload some trick 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.840
 trÃ nsit that please upload any 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.120
 Well, this week I present this 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.370
 new trick is a trick for a single 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.170
 player specifically but good can 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 be several in game 1 doing the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.220
 trick and the others can go 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.780
 moving a little bit around there but what 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.449
 What happens is that there is not a place 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.820
 concrete where they can put themselves but 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.219
 it can be fun according to all 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.250
 ways I present it as a trick for 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.560
 one player 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.750
 well first of all tell you that the 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.960
 trick is more complicated than it seems 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.120
 you know I'm not going to paint it like a trick 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.190
 easy because it is not, but it is 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.210
 it 's a pretty curious trick 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.650
 we need a turbine and a shield to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.360
 then I have put the camera in 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.830
 third person this movie camera that 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.990
 has useful heat so you can see the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.690
 detail what happens when you get 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.880
 do the trick you see we get right in 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.190
 the trunk of the car since I put it 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.350
 because in the first person as you see in 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.750
 the game so you can get an idea of 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.090
 the measures that you can take you could 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.610
 guide a little when putting the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.840
 objects but I 'm telling you it's not easy 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.960
 in agreement you have to pull towards 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.940
 go ahead and release the shield if it breaks 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.259
 as in this case the good thing that you have 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.630
 inside the shield and you can go back to 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.490
 catch it without any problem 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.200
 we return to take the shield we went out 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.090
 the turbine always the corner to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 remember we throw a little bit towards 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.830
 in front and let's go back and we 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.960
 have to do this what I'm seeing in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.030
 the video a kind of how it starts to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.470
 shake the screen according to shake 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.520
 like he wants to get us out for some 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.879
 side 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.819
 we started jumping and so on 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.370
 until we get into the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.780
 trunk we are already inside be careful 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.330
 because it is a trick from which we can 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.760
 leave easily and inadvertently we could 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 leave not now you can make rounds 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.410
 very high if you had some weapon in the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.780
 farm then take them we can catch 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.000
 all the bonuses I also bought the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.129
 galvanized cuffs because when you want 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.989
 leave to keep money in the bank then 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.299
 It is always helpful for them 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.459
 beings of the fog so they do not bother 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.130
 so much so the trick is sometimes 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.560
 I've only tested it until round 20 already 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.910
 you know that I like to deepen 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.130
 very much the tricks and get to rounds 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.470
 very high but due to circumstances or 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.140
 I was freezing the play or the voice was going 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.540
 of the game or some bullshit 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.209
 agreement then I decided to finish off 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.099
 speak in round 20 I want to give you the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.760
