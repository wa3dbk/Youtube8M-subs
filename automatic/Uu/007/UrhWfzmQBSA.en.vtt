00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.960
 and I was that team this video I'm going 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.330
 This is teaching. It's not. I'll show it to you. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.790
 How do you correct some errors there? 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.800
 your old server database 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.800
 so there goes the first mistake 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.290
 well this first mistake is common in 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.930
 32-bit computers that this is not 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.870
 is known with the internal command or 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 external a program took nine rebounds 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.360
 To solve this, look, you see. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.430
 here on your main disk here you 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.470
 here are the programs if it were 64 bits 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.080
 selling x86 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.980
 if I do not see normal I am x feather or 32 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.300
 bits 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.300
 open will not have the java square achaque 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.820
 abraham we go higher here in the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.030
 61 highest version I want here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.710
 on top of this bar here will have this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:24.479
 address here sir some flaws 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:28.649
 java from a copy will start you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.810
 Click to click the item 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.610
 It's not really what you've done in 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.960
 computer here that does not endorse external 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.960
 credit on system properties 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.469
 Advanced Settings 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.219
 this is not going to change much the xp 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.500
 You go to my iac computer 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:59.360
 left corner will have this is the one 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.210
 same thing as system ownership 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.090
 then the same thing appears and goes 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.700
 open it here mine or you see that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.410
 there are environment variables 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.490
 Ok here you go a new one here I cede 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.210
 time all a capital all a control 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.460
 with this place here in ok 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.080
 here you will probably find a 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.400
 variable efe 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.610
 you will already have and edit and until the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.390
 Finally, place a semicolon and paste the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.170
 same bad thing if you did not have pf only 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.170
 click new 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.470
 After that, just for you, it worked. 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:55.310
 here ok click I was already thinking 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:59.680
 in you believe cmd there are java for 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.970
 see if you are spending the week if you do not 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.280
 it's working, it's going to work 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.900
 Error here is starting your 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.310
 life 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.310
 so let's go to the next mistake 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.350
 this other error occurs because with your 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.240
 processor is half old or the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.930
 program is not compatible with your 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.150
 computer 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.569
 So you're going to open the link I put 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.950
 in the description here does not change anything and is that 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.100
 You will find the version of your 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.810
 computer here will usually be this 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:43.700
 here is if it is 32 bits and if it were 64 it is 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.060
 this in 30 or medium 38 you download and 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.900
 install also I did there in the video 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.010
 because this is an older version 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.450
 so the installation will not change anything 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.450
 and we also have this other error here 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.959
 usually occurs because you do not 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:13.549
 wrote a year in this passage here 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:16.639
 achaque this file is that the steps m 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.820
 6 click edit and check 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.850
 again this is correct since 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.610
 you installed your version 5.1 you're going 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.800
 have to also change the version 5.1 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.000
 here the envy, but with 5 I 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.130
 I put it there in the video 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.340
 and here you put files of 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:43.460
 close the program and then save these 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.840
 three corrected bugs will likely 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.180
 run your 2064 server that 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.610
 now until the next video has worked 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.699
 idea of ​​a young man and shares this 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.539
 video only for your favorite friends 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.389
 will also help to grow the channel 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.810
 So this has now spoken until the next 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.810
