00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.830
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.830
 On, on, pending 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.630
 this is the proof that my mechanism of 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 defense is unbreakable with these 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.580
 walls nobody can cross my 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.350
 fort there are many guys welcome 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.390
 to a new video and this we are here in 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.670
 minecraft xbox 360 with a new video 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.739
 total that I bring to you and this time 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.770
 I bring as the title of the video says 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.020
 how to make a self repairable wall worth 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.809
 how they saw there at the beginning that is super 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.190
 great of this this tutorial 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.530
 It is quite small because it can be good 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.629
 make walls without doing so much 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.460
 effort is worth it and what we are going to need 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.100
 the material alonsitos 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.559
 we're going to need redstone torches 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.970
 redstone reddish stone repeaters 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.309
 we're going to need lava water pistons not 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.830
 sticky and construction material 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.630
 In my case, this block cited that what 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.480
 first thing we 're going to do we 're going to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.290
 place a platform with 11 pistons 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.280
 it's worth 1 2 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.420
 is 4 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.680
 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 is worth this moment that 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.180
 I is getting dark and I can not 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 Believe the boys once we have 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.520
 our piston platform is going to 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.960
 to be something like that and it's worth now with 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.759
 our construction material that goes 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.210
 to do this let's do the following 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.759
 ok let's leave two blocks of 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.619
 space on this side two blocks of 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.140
 space also on this side is worth of 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.540
 each side and we will teach everything 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.909
 ok let's cover well well fine 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.100
 legal 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.909
 we take this we take this this and 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.520
 this is valid and here it can be in this 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.909
 or in this but vilar action of this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.179
 we make a hole worth a hole of 1 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.840
 x 11 same here and here that we are going to do 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.929
 let's throw water let's throw water 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.109
 we throw water 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.250
 and on this side we will throw the spittle 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:20.269
 lava we have the lava lava lava lava lava 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.480
 wash and wash until pebbles are made 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.180
 very well perfect and now we are going to do 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.079
 a hole here is worth to enter below 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.079
 of the platform 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.130
 let's dig and I'll put here a 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.300
 limit so you know where I'm at 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.300
 digging to see here 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.549
 up to here, it's up to here we're already 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.299
 below now 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.299
 let's break this 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.790
 let's break let's break let's go 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.549
 to break 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.079
 it's not over here it's up to here I think and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.140
 we will complete in the back 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.510
 to leave us more space 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.060
 very well very well I hope not to do them 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.660
 so much fun with these guys very well 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.980
 now you are here and now 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.330
 right here we are going to place 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.980
 repeaters worth repeaters cities 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.080
 repeaters up here here we go to 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.330
 place more blocks 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.430
 because right there behind is the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.590
 redstone 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.069
 very good here redstone redstone redstone 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.200
 redstone and redstone to see if we are 11 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:35.790
 verify that if he said in the 11 guys 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.569
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 perfect that 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.930
 is the following 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.299
 let's make a clock worth a watch and 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.790
 this is going to be 2 x 2 here I mean 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.439
 this is going to make a clock 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.220
 remember to make a clock of these 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.550
 is 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.760
 clockwise 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:59.510
 worth the redundancy here two and here 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.530
 again two is worth now let's join them 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.680
 and we are going to activate them 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:15.670
 since they are like this we are going to give each 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:18.010
 repeater 31 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 and 23 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.780
 because he has to have a 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.760
 moderate speed so you can 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.060
 operate the mechanism now yes already 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.650
 we can join the ones I want 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.650
 here we can join them 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.389
 and here we are going to place a repeater 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.600
 equal to guys is his his auto wall 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.960
 repairable 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.539
 and it is being built alone 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.400
 I'm going to leave a moment of incidence 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.400
 for this incredibly amazing moment 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:06.180
 and okay girls this has a clear limit 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.580
 has a limit of how much that block was 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.760
 If you had a limit of 13 blocks worth of 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.710
 high or is not much high but as 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.980
 can see there they can expand it 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.230
 very much very much mechanism and is 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.870
 super cool that is me I flip with this 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.040
 and he sees it I think that until here he limits 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.040
 up to here it's worth 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:34.319
 very well very well up there that limit and 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:38.520
 that limit would simply be that 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:41.969
 yes yes destroy them here we are going to break 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.129
 a little bit is repaired, we're going to do the 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.249
 test with the same as the start of 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:50.090
 video with tnt 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:57.010
 so they can see that yes 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:06:01.430
 as well as repair this and we give it good 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:03.610
 we give to this as you can see it's going to 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.610
 to break 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:11.650
 that is, it is still preparing very well and 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.930
 good guys this has been practically 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.939
 all the tutorial in the next 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.830
 tutorial that already has already been 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.919
 planning is going to be also how to do 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.259
 a bridge is worth a self-repairing bridge 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.409
 it's going to be like this but in a vertical position 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.249
 it's going to be a lot more complicated guys 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.249
 you liked it 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.800
 the videos I ask God 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:44.899
 struggling 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.099
 A) Yes
