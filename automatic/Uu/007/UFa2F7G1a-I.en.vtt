00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.450
 Sharp and Icube Institute 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.950
 Has 4 times the resolution of full high definition 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.299
 We released prototype of next-generation LCD TV 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.240
 This TV was developed by Icube Research Institute 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.100
 Using ICC (Integrated Cognitive Creation) technology 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.590
 It occurs when a human looks at a real scene or subject directly 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 Experience equivalent to cognitive work 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.820
 What can be obtained when watching a video 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.020
 The purpose is 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.380
 I really want to see this feeling of depth 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.070
 Normally you enter from here 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.230
 Climb up all the way up 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.329
 You can see the way to go 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.820
 Then, here is the distance 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.460
 Maybe not go about 100 meters 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.650
 I do not go to there 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.480
 You can see the bridge instantly 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.370
 When you say why you understand 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.120
 Because the eyes scan 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.260
 From this bridge to here 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.940
 Go to the stairs, dive and climb 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 When you scan your eyes 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.050
 Each position has the correct resolution 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.620
 As it is not so with a camera 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 If the focus is on somewhere 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.320
 There is a lot of bandwidth there 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 There is no sense of distance if there are no more 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.409
 Because it is bad 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.500
 I want to do the next 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.200
 This time somehow from the incoming electrical signal 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 The original real world light signal 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.179
 I want to create a technology to replace video 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.090
 The video released this time is the video taken with a high-definition camera 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.100
 Although up-converted to 4K resolution 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.510
 High resolution video and noise reduction 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.390
 Not only conventional super resolution technology 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.750
 Perspective and three-dimensional 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 It is something to be recognized in a form closer to nature 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.900
 For example, now there is a broadcast of HD 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.770
 Though 4K monitor came out 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.090
 When there is no 4K content 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.450
 As a goal the electrical signal taken with a 4K camera 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.810
 From HD signal to 4K signal 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.420
 It is super resolution to up convert 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 It's 100% up to 4K 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.399
 It is only an electrical signal 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.510
 In the light signal, not the electrical signal 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.160
 The place where you are making a picture 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.220
 I want to see 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.310
 This prototype is from October 4 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.000
 It will be held at Makuhari Messe 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.300
 Displayed for reference at CEATEC JAPAN 2011 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.489
 Sharp and Icube Institute 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.239
 For practical use next year 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.169
 We will jointly develop in the future
