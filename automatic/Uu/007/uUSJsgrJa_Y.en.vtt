like round Madrid players like Cristiano
Ronaldo<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.430> fucking<00:01:33.030> sick<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
Ronaldo would be fucking sick now I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.330 
Ronaldo would be fucking sick now I
don't<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.320> why<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> already

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't see why they don't do that already

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
don't see why they don't do that already
I<00:01:35.579> guess<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.939> would<00:01:36.030> add<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.869> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I guess it would add a bit more of a you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
I guess it would add a bit more of a you
know<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.619> interesting<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> game

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
know an interesting thing to the game

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.120 
know an interesting thing to the game
however<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.750> doubt<00:01:39.990> they'll<00:01:40.380> bring<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.860> but

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
however I doubt they'll bring it in but

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370 
however I doubt they'll bring it in but
I<00:01:41.310> mean<00:01:41.520> Ronaldo<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.270> probably<00:01:42.720> my<00:01:42.930> favorite

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

which is why I don't think he will be in
nine<00:01:58.259> well<00:01:58.560> he<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> legend<00:01:59.369> anytime

to<00:02:47.400> Ebro<00:02:47.879> if<00:02:48.150> they<00:02:48.390> added<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:49.260> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
to Ebro if they added that in but I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.780 
to Ebro if they added that in but I
don't<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.769> they'd<00:02:49.859> go<00:02:50.040> anyway<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.489> we'll

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
don't think they'd go anyway so we'll

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.280 
don't think they'd go anyway so we'll
stop<00:02:51.000> talking<00:02:51.120> about<00:02:51.389> that<00:02:51.629> but<00:02:51.870> Beckham

personally<00:06:41.590> think<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.340> Liga<00:06:42.730> is<00:06:43.060> essentially

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
personally think the Liga is essentially

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.810 
personally think the Liga is essentially
like<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.990> two-man<00:06:44.470> League<00:06:44.800> Barcelona<00:06:45.460> Real

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
like a two-man League Barcelona Real

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.430 
like a two-man League Barcelona Real
Madrid<00:06:46.150> obviously<00:06:46.570> now<00:06:46.780> it's<00:06:46.810> not<00:06:47.260> as

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
Madrid obviously now it's not as

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.140 
Madrid obviously now it's not as
starting<00:06:47.770> to<00:06:47.830> come<00:06:47.980> with<00:06:48.190> like<00:06:48.340> Athletico<00:06:48.970> and

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
starting to come with like Athletico and

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.120 
starting to come with like Athletico and
whatnot<00:06:49.510> but<00:06:49.540> back<00:06:49.870> then<00:06:50.140> it<00:06:50.590> was<00:06:50.770> pretty<00:06:50.980> much

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
whatnot but back then it was pretty much

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.030 
whatnot but back then it was pretty much
a<00:06:51.190> two<00:06:51.520> team<00:06:51.760> lead<00:06:52.030> so<00:06:52.390> as<00:06:52.630> you<00:06:52.930> know<00:06:53.050> I've<00:06:53.590> lost
