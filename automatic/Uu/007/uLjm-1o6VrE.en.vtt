week<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> low<00:01:21.940> 20s<00:01:22.540> I<00:01:22.869> have<00:01:23.530> been<00:01:23.740> letting

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
week in the low 20s I have been letting

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.830 
week in the low 20s I have been letting
it<00:01:24.340> breathe<00:01:24.549> a<00:01:24.610> little<00:01:24.790> bit<00:01:24.970> on<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.390> highway

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
it breathe a little bit on the highway

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.260 
it breathe a little bit on the highway
under<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.830> speed<00:01:27.010> limit<00:01:27.040> but<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.090> know<00:01:28.180> those

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
under the speed limit but you know those

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.270 
under the speed limit but you know those
acceleration<00:01:28.960> points<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.619> think<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.130> can

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
acceleration points so I think you can

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.680 
acceleration points so I think you can
get<00:01:30.400> better<00:01:30.610> gas<00:01:30.850> mileage<00:01:30.909> if<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.420> drive<00:01:31.659> a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
get better gas mileage if you drive a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.120 
get better gas mileage if you drive a
little<00:01:31.930> bit<00:01:32.020> smarter<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.830> recommended

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
straight as possible I can hit the
roofline<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:17.560> there<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.860> an<00:02:17.950> indent<00:02:18.400> here<00:02:18.460> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
roofline but there is an indent here so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.980 
roofline but there is an indent here so
that<00:02:18.880> gives<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.240> little<00:02:19.480> bit<00:02:19.569> more<00:02:19.750> room

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
that gives you a little bit more room

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.390 
that gives you a little bit more room
and<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.560> if<00:02:20.650> you're<00:02:20.770> looking<00:02:20.830> at<00:02:21.040> someone<00:02:21.310> who

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and so if you're looking at someone who

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.340 
and so if you're looking at someone who
might<00:02:21.520> be<00:02:21.610> 62<00:02:22.060> or<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.360> unless<00:02:22.990> they<00:02:23.140> want<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
might be 62 or so unless they want to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.559 
might be 62 or so unless they want to
really<00:02:23.650> scootch<00:02:24.160> back<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:25.000> will<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.330> little

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
really scootch back it will be a little

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.210 
really scootch back it will be a little
bit<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> tight<00:02:25.990> side<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.350> someone<00:02:26.560> 6-2<00:02:27.040> and

bit the tight side for someone 6-2 and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.460 
bit the tight side for someone 6-2 and
above<00:02:27.490> there<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.360> sliding<00:02:28.720> roof<00:02:29.020> right<00:02:29.200> here

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
above there is a sliding roof right here

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.920 
above there is a sliding roof right here
it<00:02:29.740> does<00:02:29.950> tilt<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.580> slide<00:02:30.730> back<00:02:30.850> as<00:02:31.300> well<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.480> a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
it does tilt and slide back as well so a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.930 
it does tilt and slide back as well so a
little<00:02:32.230> more<00:02:32.410> space<00:02:32.680> right<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.280> there

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940
