changes that happen with this shoe that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.860 
changes that happen with this shoe that
a<00:03:02.290> lot<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.800> people<00:03:03.130> were<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:04.270> know<00:03:04.390> not

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
a lot of people were you know not

the<00:03:07.390> sole<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:07.870> got<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.560> jump<00:03:08.830> man<00:03:08.980> got<00:03:09.190> heavier

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
the sole we got the jump man got heavier

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.350 
the sole we got the jump man got heavier
he<00:03:10.209> wasn't<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:10.870> big<00:03:11.050> originally<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.360> also

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
he wasn't this big originally and also

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.290 
he wasn't this big originally and also
he<00:03:13.630> got<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> little<00:03:13.900> bit<00:03:14.080> heavier<00:03:14.410> on<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:16.030> front

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
he got a little bit heavier on the front

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.920 
he got a little bit heavier on the front
tongue<00:03:17.160> from<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.280> side<00:03:18.519> view<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
tongue from the side view one of the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.380 
tongue from the side view one of the
things<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.170> changed<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.890> i<00:03:21.190> think<00:03:21.640> it's<00:03:22.239> for

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
things that changed is i think it's for

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.050 
things that changed is i think it's for
the<00:03:22.510> better<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.590> air<00:03:24.100> unit<00:03:24.519> actually<00:03:24.910> got

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
the better is the air unit actually got

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.560 
the better is the air unit actually got
bigger<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.700> upper<00:03:28.090> one<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.510> the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
bigger and in the upper one of the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.290 
bigger and in the upper one of the
things<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.780> I'm<00:03:29.080> really<00:03:29.140> sad<00:03:29.830> about<00:03:29.860> is<00:03:30.400> that

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
things that I'm really sad about is that

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.540 
things that I'm really sad about is that
it<00:03:31.780> no<00:03:32.019> longer<00:03:32.050> has<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.560> reflective<00:03:33.160> material

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
it no longer has a reflective material

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.690 
it no longer has a reflective material
underlay<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.150> was<00:03:34.239> originally<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.720> there

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
underlay that was originally on there

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.790 
underlay that was originally on there
but<00:03:36.700> uh<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:37.269> guess<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.200> can't<00:03:38.380> really<00:03:38.410> tell

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
but uh I guess you can't really tell

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.160 
but uh I guess you can't really tell
because<00:03:38.950> there's<00:03:39.730> no<00:03:39.850> flash<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.080> the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
because there's no flash so but on the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.330 
because there's no flash so but on the
original<00:03:41.500> ones<00:03:41.650> if<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.860> took<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.070> flash

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
original ones if you took a flash

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.340 
original ones if you took a flash
picture<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.360> kind<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.720> light<00:03:43.930> up<00:03:44.080> on<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
picture it kind of light up on the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.720 
picture it kind of light up on the
inside<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:44.830> you'd<00:03:44.950> see<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.250> reflective

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
inside and you'd see the reflective

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.009 
inside and you'd see the reflective
feature<00:03:46.000> um<00:03:46.810> on<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.799> front<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.700> tongues

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
feature um on the front on the tongues

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.300 
feature um on the front on the tongues
one<00:03:50.019> thing<00:03:50.200> that's<00:03:50.290> different<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.950> same<00:03:51.130> as

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
one thing that's different the same as
