00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.450
 January 9 we were talking about 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.130
 nuclear weapons and its constant 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.700
 reduction in the territory of the Russian 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.700
 federations 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.210
 released nuclear submarine yuri 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.509
 long-armed there is a new strategic 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.130
 rocket mace 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.740
 nuclear weapons and we speak with us 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.419
 new nuclear weapons have appeared everywhere 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.759
 on all channels on all media like this 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.289
 consistent with a constant decrease 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.360
 because any struggle even if your 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.600
 army enters separate platoon platoon 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.480
 or battalions may not even produce a 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.800
 knowing just need to call 41 gur forty 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.960
 the first year the war began 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.430
 our unit is some red 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.260
 the army in the south began to attack then 41 years 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.940
 the first day of the war they come because 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.230
 that the contribution was recorded so war 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.810
 on foreign territory therefore it is 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.240
 normal process that is basically we 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.740
 retreat but there is some success here 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.920
 this is a separate success very good 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.329
 congratulations you well here you thank you 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.150
 Then they talked about what we create 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.680
 new arrangements are n't you talking about now 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.060
 nuclear materials but they have 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.800
 shift from one rocket suddenly something 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.830
 there is this here is a new rocket mace 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.750
 also on is a new mechanism with 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.090
 old materials one hundred percent one hundred 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 percent of course just took removed from 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 disarmed and the missiles before this set 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.820
 here because it is more modern 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 the filling is understandable 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.479
 steel was removed from the rocket which is 20 30 years old 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.140
 80 percent sell gave to America 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.450
 shot 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.510
 and the remaining 20 percent put on 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.870
 our small rocket is enough for us 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.490
 bomb and who knows all the same 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.229
 secret strategic weapon 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.940
 deterrence to the Americans 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.520
 do not enter our land 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.090
 they will send an army of invasion upon us 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.490
 so two hundred three hundred thousand the former when those 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.150
 who will not finish the marina 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.369
 which they prepare there for her by 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.979
 finishing off them prepare others 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.049
 ten fan of course destabilization 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.210
 we bring him the number of refugees in that 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.280
 the number of refugees will militants from right there 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 recruit massive quantities cooks a pair 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.460
 years in the camps and not ready yet 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 anywhere is the same mechanism permanent 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.170
 reproduction with an increased truth 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.450
 gifts to a resident 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.110
 Well, blacks too, knives were blacks including 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.750
 fought no secret therefore it is the opposite 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.850
 only strengthens people for pennies 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 on the contrary so the military is there I do not know 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.920
 10 thousand dollars and here it costs 200 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.770
 dollars well that's all what it is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.020
 leads no pension insurance at all 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.680
 nothing of course ready to die any 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.050
 moment so these are the processes and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.610
 to and they are preparing a war but if u 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.870
 we will not be nuclear weapons then they 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.540
 will be like Yugoslavia 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.430
 they themselves will finish that speed up the events 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.489
 He understands and constraints 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.020
 which nobody could apply anyway 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.970
 can not can not apply 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.290
 can not apply there in events from 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.840
 Yugoslavia was mine 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.940
 and what kind of lava events do you have ? 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.860
 allow such events then with no one 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.959
 this line does not step over if it were not 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.810
 It was a nuclear weapon and it was not necessary 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.489
 would cook militants in syria just 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.080
 It could oust him glory wind 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.940
 understood nor well with all of this whole 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.790
 chemical it makes go more 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.430
 difficult long way Americans are not in 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.230
 forehead as they did in the faded spring 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.970
 if i had a nuclear weapon from ukraine 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.459
 would have done which gave on command 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.500
 nuclear weapons by the way and the longer 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.769
 the way as if sthenu under the name 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.780
 Formations of this military army 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.970
 whether the punitive militants are Syrian 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.040
 low then or then they have already done yes 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.519
 they did it as a reaction availability in 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.310
 Russia 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.870
 less than 10 nuclear weapons 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.549
 what was the Soviet Union who 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.920
 all the same anyway there is somewhere won and 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.660
 allowed Russia to gain time that is 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.579
 she played a positive role 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.680
 Putin refused to execute the order 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:04:00.489
 Americans in a united disarmament in 2000 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.440
 well yes from 2000 to 2004 including 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.260
 sounded on the shooting tops ie 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.100
 seriously this is exactly allowed 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.640
 win some time 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.070
 and if he then fulfills the order one would 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.190
 fulfilled the same as the order for Chechnya 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.100
 didn't spill out 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.440
 we wouldn't have everything just wasn't 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.480
 At first there was no yard belly I would have 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.200
 us processes were in 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.200
 at the same time
