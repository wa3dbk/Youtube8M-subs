I'm going to talk to you about the

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.269 
I'm going to talk to you about the
difference<00:00:03.330> between<00:00:03.360> throwing<00:00:03.959> punches<00:00:04.350> with

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
difference between throwing punches with

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
difference between throwing punches with
a<00:00:05.400> vertical<00:00:05.670> fist<00:00:06.150> versus<00:00:07.080> throwing<00:00:07.379> punches

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
a vertical fist versus throwing punches

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.430 
a vertical fist versus throwing punches
with<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> horizontal<00:00:08.519> fist

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
with a horizontal fist

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.770 
with a horizontal fist
vertical<00:00:10.440> fisted<00:00:10.800> punches<00:00:11.190> okay<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:12.660> this

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
vertical fisted punches okay with this

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.660 
vertical fisted punches okay with this
fist<00:00:13.230> standing<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.950> these<00:00:14.519> are

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
fist standing up like this these are

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.090 
fist standing up like this these are
generally<00:00:15.030> easier<00:00:15.450> less<00:00:16.020> effort<00:00:16.470> less<00:00:16.500> energy

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
generally easier less effort less energy

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.710 
generally easier less effort less energy
because<00:00:17.430> you're<00:00:17.520> not<00:00:17.670> using<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> extra

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
because you're not using the extra

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.290 
because you're not using the extra
energy<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.260> focus<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.890> rotate<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.880> arm<00:00:21.119> over

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
energy and focus to rotate this arm over

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
energy and focus to rotate this arm over
you<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.689> kind<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.930> fling<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.320> forward<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.580> for

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you just kind of fling it forward so for

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.640 
you just kind of fling it forward so for
that<00:00:23.910> reason<00:00:23.970> because<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.050> easier<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> would

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that reason because it's easier I would

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
that reason because it's easier I would
say<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.099> little<00:00:26.340> faster<00:00:26.789> generally<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
say it's a little faster generally a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.810 
say it's a little faster generally a
little<00:00:27.960> faster<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.250> reason<00:00:29.310> you'll

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
little faster and for that reason you'll

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.910 
little faster and for that reason you'll
see<00:00:30.000> guys<00:00:30.179> um<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.529> when<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.740> throw

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
see guys um you know when they throw

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740 
see guys um you know when they throw
Shushan<00:00:32.309> combinations<00:00:32.880> they're<00:00:33.090> using<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
Shushan combinations they're using a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.049 
Shushan combinations they're using a
vertical<00:00:33.870> fist<00:00:34.320> okay<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.700> because

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
vertical fist okay that's just because

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
vertical fist okay that's just because
it's<00:00:36.360> less<00:00:36.540> energy<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.770> also<00:00:38.070> why

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's less energy and that's also why

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
it's less energy and that's also why
when<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.790> tired<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.930> end<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.230> throwing

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
when you get tired you end up throwing

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
when you get tired you end up throwing
with<00:00:40.950> vertical<00:00:41.370> fisted<00:00:41.700> punches<00:00:42.030> because

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
with vertical fisted punches because

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.330 
with vertical fisted punches because
you're<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:42.600> turning<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:44.100> fists

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you're not turning over your your fists

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.959 
you're not turning over your your fists
anymore

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
anymore

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.959

naturally they're not like this they
shouldn't<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
shouldn't be like this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.439 
shouldn't be like this
your<00:00:53.190> stand<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.329> an

strategically vertical fisted punches

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.540 
strategically vertical fisted punches
are<00:01:00.870> great<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.469> splitting<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> guard<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.430> up

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
are great for splitting a guard right up

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.860 
are great for splitting a guard right up
the<00:01:02.640> middle<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.629> opponent

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the middle if you have an opponent

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
the middle if you have an opponent
that's<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.880> vertical<00:01:05.880> fist<00:01:06.060> punch

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that's like this vertical fist punch

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
that's like this vertical fist punch
more<00:01:06.600> likely<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> sneak<00:01:07.200> through<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.250> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
more likely to sneak through or if you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
more likely to sneak through or if you
want<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> throw<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:09.479> your

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
opponent's guard it's mimic maybe as an

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
opponent's guard it's mimic maybe as an
elbow<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.549> type<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> throw

around you want to get around here or

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.640 
around you want to get around here or
yes<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> guard<00:01:15.869> ahadees<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> throw

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
yes this guard ahadees going to throw

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
yes this guard ahadees going to throw
around<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.220> probably<00:01:17.369> easier<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> throw<00:01:18.150> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
around it's probably easier to throw it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.789 
around it's probably easier to throw it
with<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> vertical<00:01:18.990> fist<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> punch<00:01:19.470> this

with the vertical fist and punch this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.969 
with the vertical fist and punch this
has<00:01:20.490> easier<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.630> loop<00:01:21.840> around<00:01:21.990> also

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
has easier to just loop around also

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
has easier to just loop around also
let's<00:01:23.280> say<00:01:23.400> he<00:01:23.520> blocks<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.450> probably<00:01:24.869> less

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
let's say he blocks it's probably less

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.840 
let's say he blocks it's probably less
painful<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.770> wrist<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> catch<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.549> this

angle<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.299> kind<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.720> painful<00:01:30.920> small

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

horizontal<00:01:34.829> punches<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.280> generally<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.030> would

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
horizontal punches are generally I would

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.810 
horizontal punches are generally I would
say<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:37.170> powerful<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
say more powerful because when you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
say more powerful because when you
rotate<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.600> fist<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.009> elbow

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
rotate this fist you look at my elbow

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.810 
rotate this fist you look at my elbow
the<00:01:41.520> elbow<00:01:41.610> comes<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.270> faster<00:01:43.189> okay<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.670> go

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the elbow comes up faster okay if I go

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.130 
the elbow comes up faster okay if I go
vertical<00:01:45.240> fisted<00:01:45.540> punch<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:45.990> kind

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
vertical fisted punch it out what kind

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
vertical fisted punch it out what kind
of<00:01:46.229> stays<00:01:46.439> down<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.159> less<00:01:47.280> power<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
of stays down so there's less power and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.569 
of stays down so there's less power and
you<00:01:48.659> want<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.229> want<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.430> give

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you want you want this up this will give

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
you want you want this up this will give
you<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:50.729> power<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> wrist<00:01:51.689> more

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you more power for the wrist more

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.530 
you more power for the wrist more
support<00:01:52.380> okay<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> same<00:01:53.939> time<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.420> also

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
support okay at the same time it's also

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.999 
support okay at the same time it's also
more<00:01:54.869> effort<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.350> energy<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:55.829> now<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
more effort more energy because now you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.539 
more effort more energy because now you
have<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.140> at

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
have to you know you have to do this at

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.969 
have to you know you have to do this at
long<00:01:59.549> range<00:02:00.200> when<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.320> throwing<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.710> long

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
long range when I'm throwing a long

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
long range when I'm throwing a long
punch<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:03.119> almost<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.810> doesn't<00:02:03.960> matter

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
punch it almost kind of doesn't matter

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.450 
punch it almost kind of doesn't matter
because<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> punch<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.040> straightened<00:02:05.399> out

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
because the punch was straightened out

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.389 
because the punch was straightened out
anyway<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.270> has<00:02:06.450> time<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:07.020> short<00:02:07.829> distance

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
anyway it has time at short distance

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.520 
anyway it has time at short distance
right<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.670> inside

i'vei've a guy who's right next to me

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.820 
i'vei've a guy who's right next to me
and<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.850> come<00:02:14.060> up<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.290> pop<00:02:15.560> them<00:02:15.680> like

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and I come up and I and I pop them like

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.010 
and I come up and I and I pop them like
that<00:02:16.840> okay

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
that okay

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.800 
that okay
maybe<00:02:18.230> not<00:02:18.440> as<00:02:18.560> much<00:02:18.590> power<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.540> I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
maybe not as much power if I do this I

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.600 
maybe not as much power if I do this I
can<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> lot<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.860> power<00:02:22.069> even<00:02:22.370> though<00:02:22.400> this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
can get a lot of power even though this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.280 
can get a lot of power even though this
fist<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:22.970> only<00:02:23.209> moving<00:02:23.510> three<00:02:23.930> four<00:02:24.140> inches

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
fist is only moving three four inches

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.280 
fist is only moving three four inches
but<00:02:24.620> because<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.580> did<00:02:25.819> more<00:02:26.090> work<00:02:26.330> back<00:02:26.720> here<00:02:27.110> I

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
but because I did more work back here I

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.680 
but because I did more work back here I
was<00:02:28.040> able<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.340> put<00:02:28.580> more<00:02:28.760> leverage<00:02:29.120> more<00:02:29.300> crank

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
was able to put more leverage more crank

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.949 
was able to put more leverage more crank
into<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.770> shot<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.340> can<00:02:32.090> also<00:02:32.420> crank<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
into that shot I can also crank the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.410 
into that shot I can also crank the
opposite<00:02:33.410> way<00:02:33.560> instead<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.950> going<00:02:34.640> vertical

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
opposite way instead of going vertical

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.390 
opposite way instead of going vertical
or<00:02:35.480> asana<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.870> way<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.260> go<00:02:36.400> horizontal

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
or asana this way I can go horizontal

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.870 
or asana this way I can go horizontal
this<00:02:37.520> way

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this way

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.630 
this way
upper<00:02:38.420> cut<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.840> helps<00:02:39.110> crank<00:02:39.489> when<00:02:40.489> you

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
upper cut so this helps crank when you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.460 
upper cut so this helps crank when you
throw<00:02:40.940> an<00:02:41.120> uppercut<00:02:41.300> with<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.050> vertical

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
throw an uppercut with the vertical

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.640 
throw an uppercut with the vertical
fisted<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.040> vertical<00:02:43.940> fist<00:02:44.150> its<00:02:45.110> shoulder

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
fisted a vertical fist its shoulder

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.250 
fisted a vertical fist its shoulder
becomes<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.250> shoulder<00:02:47.060> punch<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:47.900> try<00:02:48.200> it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
becomes a shoulder punch you can try it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.830 
becomes a shoulder punch you can try it
yourself<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.830> feel<00:02:49.070> if<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.880> turn<00:02:50.660> it

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
yourself and feel if I turn it

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.800 
yourself and feel if I turn it
horizontal<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.800> this<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.450> throw<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.630> now

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
horizontal like this and throw it now

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.600 
horizontal like this and throw it now
you<00:02:53.870> feel<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.530> easier<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:54.980> me<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.190> get<00:02:55.370> more

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
you feel it's easier for me to get more

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.809 
you feel it's easier for me to get more
back<00:02:55.850> muscle<00:02:56.269> into<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.569> so<00:02:57.290> for<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.530> reason

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
back muscle into it so for that reason

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.680 
back muscle into it so for that reason
uppercuts<00:02:58.819> are<00:02:58.940> probably<00:02:59.330> more<00:02:59.480> powerful

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
uppercuts are probably more powerful

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.420 
uppercuts are probably more powerful
this<00:03:00.110> way<00:03:00.260> than<00:03:00.470> they<00:03:00.590> are<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.950> way<00:03:01.100> even

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
this way than they are this way even

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.340 
this way than they are this way even
though<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.850> do<00:03:01.970> both<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:03.080> major

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
though you can do both the major

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.020 
though you can do both the major
difference<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.370> has<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:04.760> with<00:03:04.850> your

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
difference really it has to do with your

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.240 
difference really it has to do with your
strategy<00:03:05.300> where<00:03:05.810> are<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.989> ain't<00:03:06.230> okay<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:07.160> I'm

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
strategy where are you ain't okay if I'm

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.140 
strategy where are you ain't okay if I'm
aiming<00:03:07.580> up<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.180> I'm<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:09.050> straight

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
aiming up here and I'm going straight

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.330 
aiming up here and I'm going straight
horizontal<00:03:11.150> vertical<00:03:11.830> kinda<00:03:12.830> doesn't<00:03:13.010> matter

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
horizontal vertical kinda doesn't matter

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.690 
horizontal vertical kinda doesn't matter
if<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:14.360> gets<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.870> gets<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:15.230> if<00:03:15.489> I'm<00:03:16.489> throwing

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
if it gets in it gets in if I'm throwing

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.250 
if it gets in it gets in if I'm throwing
a<00:03:17.120> medium<00:03:17.750> okay

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
a medium okay

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.410 
a medium okay
this<00:03:18.560> lower<00:03:19.370> range<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:20.150> throwing

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
this lower range and I'm throwing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.110 
this lower range and I'm throwing
straight<00:03:21.280> okay<00:03:22.280> maybe<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:22.970> more

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
straight okay maybe this is more

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.690 
straight okay maybe this is more
comfortable<00:03:23.390> maybe<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:25.400> know<00:03:25.519> this

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
comfortable maybe this is you know this

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.550 
comfortable maybe this is you know this
depends<00:03:26.329> depends<00:03:26.750> how<00:03:26.870> low<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.200> are<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.470> I'm

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
depends depends how low you are if I'm

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.800 
depends depends how low you are if I'm
throwing<00:03:27.709> really<00:03:28.430> straight<00:03:28.730> down<00:03:28.940> maybe<00:03:29.600> this

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
throwing really straight down maybe this

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.690 
throwing really straight down maybe this
is<00:03:29.959> not<00:03:30.079> as<00:03:30.230> comfortable<00:03:30.470> maybe<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.549> to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
is not as comfortable maybe I have to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.270 
is not as comfortable maybe I have to
turn<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.390> way<00:03:32.709> right<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.130> little

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
turn it this way right so it's a little

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.740 
turn it this way right so it's a little
bit<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.549> enough<00:03:34.700> maybe<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.239> one<00:03:35.390> comfortable

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
bit of enough maybe this one comfortable

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.560 
bit of enough maybe this one comfortable
Europe<00:03:35.989> if<00:03:36.079> I'm<00:03:36.200> throwing<00:03:36.320> around<00:03:37.209> low<00:03:38.209> level

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
Europe if I'm throwing around low level

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.840 
Europe if I'm throwing around low level
and<00:03:38.690> I'm<00:03:38.750> throwing<00:03:38.989> around<00:03:39.170> then<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.730> know

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
and I'm throwing around then you know

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.150 
and I'm throwing around then you know
this<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.750> more<00:03:41.930> comfortable<00:03:42.170> or<00:03:42.500> upside<00:03:42.920> down

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
this is more comfortable or upside down

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.819 
this is more comfortable or upside down
but<00:03:44.000> probably<00:03:44.630> not<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:45.019> this<00:03:45.170> this<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.650> not

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
but probably not like this this is not

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.190 
but probably not like this this is not
as<00:03:45.980> good<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.609> risk<00:03:46.820> now<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.630> tricky<00:03:48.019> one

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
as good for the risk now the tricky one

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.870 
as good for the risk now the tricky one
is<00:03:48.410> throwing<00:03:49.329> over<00:03:50.329> over<00:03:51.200> again<00:03:51.609> okay<00:03:52.609> but<00:03:52.790> I'm

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
is throwing over over again okay but I'm

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.180 
is throwing over over again okay but I'm
trying<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.209> throw<00:03:53.359> my<00:03:53.840> my<00:03:54.260> punch<00:03:54.530> over<00:03:54.769> the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
trying to throw my my punch over the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.550 
trying to throw my my punch over the
opponent's<00:03:55.670> jab<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.299> down<00:03:56.690> into<00:03:56.930> his<00:03:57.019> chin<00:03:57.290> I

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
opponent's jab and down into his chin I

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.440 
opponent's jab and down into his chin I
can't<00:03:58.100> do<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.400> with<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.579> vertical<00:03:58.940> fist<00:03:59.180> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
can't do that with the vertical fist the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.810 
can't do that with the vertical fist the
elbow<00:04:00.049> does<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.500> allow<00:04:00.799> me<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:01.010> bend<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.700> way

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
elbow does not allow me to bend that way

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.000 
elbow does not allow me to bend that way
so<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.750> see<00:04:03.049> guys<00:04:03.079> that<00:04:03.290> don't<00:04:03.590> turn<00:04:03.799> their

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.620 
so you see guys that don't turn their
punches<00:04:04.310> over<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:04.790> they<00:04:05.090> want<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.359> throw<00:04:05.480> an

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
right you have to lean on balance but

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.940 
right you have to lean on balance but
all<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:12.049> have<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.410> do<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:13.280> just<00:04:13.519> turn<00:04:14.680> ok<00:04:15.680> just

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
time the elbow will come up it will give

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.930 
time the elbow will come up it will give
you<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.900> angle<00:04:18.080> to<00:04:18.470> come<00:04:18.680> over<00:04:18.830> some<00:04:19.489> guys<00:04:19.669> you

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940
