walking<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.740> my<00:04:03.860> property<00:04:05.500> walking<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.940> hate

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
walking on my property walking I hate

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.480 
walking on my property walking I hate
walking<00:04:08.500> what<00:04:09.500> do<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:09.680> have<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:09.890> walk<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.340> think

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
walking what do we have to walk I think

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.610 
walking what do we have to walk I think
we<00:04:10.670> should<00:04:10.820> get<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.000> fly<00:04:11.290> then<00:04:12.290> we<00:04:12.410> won't<00:04:12.560> have

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
we should get to fly then we won't have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.290 
we should get to fly then we won't have
to<00:04:12.740> move<00:04:12.950> just<00:04:13.580> like<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.820> birds

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
to move just like the birds

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.630 
to move just like the birds
maybe<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.230> squirrels<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.620> fly<00:04:15.770> maybe<00:04:16.489> that's

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
maybe the squirrels can fly maybe that's

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.670 
maybe the squirrels can fly maybe that's
why<00:04:16.760> they<00:04:16.910> always<00:04:17.030> disappear<00:04:17.510> maybe<00:04:18.500> they're
