gets trapped in a trap

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.270 
gets trapped in a trap
because<00:00:14.210> there's<00:00:14.480> holes<00:00:14.720> in<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.020> trap<00:00:15.280> I'm

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
because there's holes in the trap I'm

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.870 
because there's holes in the trap I'm
gonna<00:00:16.520> show<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:16.790> guys<00:00:16.940> what<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:17.840> lobster<00:00:18.380> sees

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
gonna show you guys what a lobster sees

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.200 
gonna show you guys what a lobster sees
he's<00:00:19.880> going<00:00:20.119> to<00:00:20.180> come<00:00:20.420> up<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:20.810> trap<00:00:21.470> right

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
he's going to come up to a trap right

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.170 
he's going to come up to a trap right
now<00:00:23.290> he<00:00:24.310> imagined<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:25.430> is<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:25.730> view<00:00:25.939> of<00:00:26.029> the

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
now he imagined this is the view of the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.420 
now he imagined this is the view of the
lobster<00:00:26.750> he<00:00:27.349> feels<00:00:27.860> around<00:00:28.189> with<00:00:28.310> his

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
lobster he feels around with his

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.210 
lobster he feels around with his
antennas<00:00:29.060> but<00:00:29.960> right<00:00:30.500> here<00:00:30.880> this<00:00:32.110> goes<00:00:33.110> up<00:00:33.410> so

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
antennas but right here this goes up so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.569 
antennas but right here this goes up so
the<00:00:34.340> logs<00:00:34.550> will<00:00:34.790> travel<00:00:35.180> up<00:00:35.510> here<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:37.430> then

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
the logs will travel up here and then

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.370 
the logs will travel up here and then
he'll<00:00:37.790> drop<00:00:38.030> into<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.750> area<00:00:39.170> right<00:00:39.320> here

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
he'll drop into this area right here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.500 
he'll drop into this area right here
once<00:00:39.890> he<00:00:40.040> gets<00:00:40.220> past<00:00:40.430> here<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.820> bait<00:00:41.060> is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
once he gets past here the bait is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.620 
once he gets past here the bait is
hanging<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:43.190> bait<00:00:43.220> is<00:00:43.640> hanging<00:00:44.090> right<00:00:44.329> down

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
hanging the bait is hanging right down

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.550 
hanging the bait is hanging right down
right<00:00:44.870> here<00:00:45.110> off<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.440> string<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:47.560> sometimes

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
right here off a string and sometimes

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.990 
right here off a string and sometimes
the<00:00:48.710> logs<00:00:48.890> minerals<00:00:49.250> put<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.790> bait<00:00:49.970> right

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
the logs minerals put the bait right

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.780 
the logs minerals put the bait right
some<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.900> few<00:00:51.290> fish<00:00:51.530> right<00:00:51.800> through<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.280> this

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
some a few fish right through this this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.300 
some a few fish right through this this
string<00:00:53.450> right<00:00:53.630> here<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.820> they<00:00:55.940> go<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:57.310> once

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
string right here and they go in once

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.150 
string right here and they go in once
they<00:00:58.490> go<00:00:58.670> inside<00:00:59.120> there<00:00:59.560> they<00:01:00.560> kind<00:01:00.740> of<00:01:00.890> drop

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
they go inside there they kind of drop

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.929 
they go inside there they kind of drop
into<00:01:01.490> this<00:01:01.640> area<00:01:02.620> they<00:01:03.620> really<00:01:04.009> they<00:01:04.640> can't

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
into this area they really they can't

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.429 
into this area they really they can't
get<00:01:05.119> back<00:01:05.299> up<00:01:06.159> over<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:09.159> so<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.310> next<00:01:10.579> Pro

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
get back up over this so the next Pro

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.620 
get back up over this so the next Pro
progression<00:01:12.439> is<00:01:12.979> going<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.430> walk<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:14.240> this

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
progression is going to walk up this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.859 
progression is going to walk up this
rope<00:01:14.960> up<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.700> head<00:01:16.939> this<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.509> called<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
rope up this the head this is called the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.090 
rope up this the head this is called the
head<00:01:18.759> so<00:01:19.759> they'll<00:01:19.939> travel<00:01:20.270> up<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.990> head<00:01:21.229> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
head so they'll travel up the head and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.810 
head so they'll travel up the head and
then<00:01:22.999> there's<00:01:23.210> another<00:01:23.299> ring<00:01:23.749> right<00:01:24.020> here

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.540 

that<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.540> end<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.930> dropping<00:01:28.380> through<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that they end up dropping through and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.890 
that they end up dropping through and
then<00:01:29.940> they<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> parlor<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> then

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
then they go into the parlor and then

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.740 
then they go into the parlor and then
once<00:01:34.290> they're<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.800> parlor<00:01:37.040> they're<00:01:38.040> stuck

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
once they're in the parlor they're stuck

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
once they're in the parlor they're stuck
in<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.020> section<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:41.780> because

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
in that section right here because

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.850 
in that section right here because
they'll<00:01:42.960> drop<00:01:43.170> through<00:01:43.410> that<00:01:43.560> ring<00:01:43.830> right

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
they'll drop through that ring right

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.480 
they'll drop through that ring right
there

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
there

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.380 
there
then<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.180> only<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.390> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
then the only the one good thing is that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.720 
then the only the one good thing is that
on<00:01:48.660> all<00:01:49.290> lobster<00:01:49.800> traps<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.400> have<00:01:50.580> these

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
on all lobster traps they have these

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.840 
on all lobster traps they have these
escape<00:01:51.210> vents<00:01:51.600> right<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:53.280> size<00:01:53.580> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
escape vents right here and the size of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.420 
escape vents right here and the size of
this<00:01:54.000> escape<00:01:54.390> vent<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> juvenile

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
this escape vent is so that juvenile

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
this escape vent is so that juvenile
lobsters<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.830> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
lobsters can get out so actually a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
lobsters can get out so actually a
juvenile<00:01:59.310> Lobster<00:01:59.729> small<00:02:00.000> lobster<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.600> come

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
juvenile Lobster small lobster can come

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
juvenile Lobster small lobster can come
and<00:02:01.410> go<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.010> trap<00:02:02.750> go<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.870> here<00:02:04.310> travel<00:02:05.310> up

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and go in the trap go in here travel up

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.380 
and go in the trap go in here travel up
through<00:02:06.530> drop<00:02:07.530> through<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.130> ring<00:02:08.429> then

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
through drop through that ring then

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.140 
through drop through that ring then
actually<00:02:10.310> exit<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:13.940> there<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.000> go

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
actually exit right here there you go

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.680 
actually exit right here there you go
that's<00:02:16.080> how<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> works
