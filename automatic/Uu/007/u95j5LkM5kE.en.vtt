00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 with rolland stone a little tired by 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 this climb I feel like you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.710
 have escaped on alternating current 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.620
 it's true or not a good shot and then 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.960
 a shot a little less well no I tried 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.359
 to place me at best before the slopes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.090
 the most difficult of allos was shown 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 Rachid that it is mounted hyper 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.920
 it was a crazy day 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.000
 start of the race 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.710
 the beginning of the race 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 here is a moment we found ourselves 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.500
 a fifties card with kintana who 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.180
 come back with simple nibali we come out that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180
 returned to the race a bit crazy and 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.230
 try to slip into the group of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.520
 25 but my sense without race in success 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.360
 I tried to raise with my 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.180
 teammate but I have not had the good of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.829
 exit 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 in the exploded lodge I came across 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 on maul and mac was at quetta my 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.140
 level 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.270
 Roman bardet who was behind me who 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.200
 caught up with me in the descent I did 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.210
 all the descent with him and I had the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.310
 chance to fall on roman sicard in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 the last climb 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.860
 that's up to 1 kg doctor he has me well 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.610
 brought it was a day still well 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.430
 difficult and as I sensed them 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.720
 great champions like nibali have not 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.299
 says their last word 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 when you say that goes up super fast 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.200
 developed me it's a little bit you're 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 surprised by the pace of those who you 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.720
 precedes that's it they're unleashed what 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.909
 that's what you want to say no is 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 there are collective forces that are 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.399
 impressive astana sax sax 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.460
 it's really very big teams 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.390
 with renowned runners who are 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.009
 crews so that gives a quality of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.460
 which was pretty impressive and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.469
 when when a teammate has the level of a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.879
 leader effect of the tempos inevitably that 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.530
 already done enough damage 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.370
 impressive I do not know how much they 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.620
 flip to loos maybe five six 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
 runners and after we are two by two 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.680
 classes and after that's where it's the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680
 stampede
