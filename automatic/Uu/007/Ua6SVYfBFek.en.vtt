the top and a little in the midsection
we're<00:00:33.510> trying<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> figure<00:00:34.050> out<00:00:34.110> whether<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.500> go

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
we're trying to figure out whether we go

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.190 
we're trying to figure out whether we go
with<00:00:34.800> our<00:00:34.829> slicks<00:00:35.329> if<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.750> slicks

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
with our slicks if we go with the slicks

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
with our slicks if we go with the slicks
it's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> big<00:00:37.739> risk<00:00:38.010> right<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:38.969> go

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it's a big risk right now or we can go

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.549 
it's a big risk right now or we can go
with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> light<00:00:39.570> rain<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.079> we've<00:00:40.260> prepped

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
with the light rain that we've prepped

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.979 
with the light rain that we've prepped
in<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> warmer<00:00:41.489> wait<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.059> us<00:00:42.239> the

in there on the warmer wait for us the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.959 
in there on the warmer wait for us the
crews<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.829> tension<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.430> just

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
have 156 super serious consequences if

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
have 156 super serious consequences if
you<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.519> them<00:01:05.610> wrong<00:01:05.760> selflessly<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> know

little bump came back on I got the

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:52.919 
little bump came back on I got the
all-wheel-drive<00:01:51.789> system<00:01:52.030> they<00:01:52.450> told<00:01:52.659> me<00:01:52.780> back

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
all-wheel-drive system they told me back

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.859 
all-wheel-drive system they told me back
on<00:01:53.429> how<00:01:54.429> to<00:01:54.490> pin<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.819> two<00:01:55.000> wheel<00:01:55.119> drive<00:01:55.240> car

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.539 

with<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.959> exception<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.409> one<00:01:59.979> practice<00:02:00.399> we

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
with the exception of one practice we

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.850 
with the exception of one practice we
were<00:02:00.640> quickest<00:02:01.450> every<00:02:01.720> single<00:02:02.020> session<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
were quickest every single session and

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.130 
were quickest every single session and
some<00:02:03.429> recessions<00:02:03.940> five<00:02:04.179> five<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.959> six

some recessions five five and six

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.740 
some recessions five five and six
seconds<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.159> really<00:02:06.789> figured<00:02:07.299> had<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.630> been
