trumpeting trumpets Oni sets up his team
and<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.500> might<00:02:05.680> not<00:02:05.920> end<00:02:06.159> his<00:02:06.280> career<00:02:06.490> he<00:02:07.119> hasn't

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
and I might not end his career he hasn't

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.900 
and I might not end his career he hasn't
had<00:02:07.659> many<00:02:07.869> teams<00:02:08.289> good<00:02:08.920> enough<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.700> beat<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
had many teams good enough to beat the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.790 
had many teams good enough to beat the
teams<00:02:10.330> from<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.660> right<00:02:10.810> he<00:02:10.959> says<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.349> mockney

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
teams from the right he says the mockney

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.380 
teams from the right he says the mockney
so<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.920> think<00:02:12.040> he's<00:02:12.280> always<00:02:12.489> telling<00:02:12.819> that's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
so I think he's always telling that's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.190 
so I think he's always telling that's
what<00:02:13.569> he<00:02:13.630> believes<00:02:13.750> in

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
what he believes in

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.809 
what he believes in
I<00:02:14.230> don't<00:02:14.590> agree<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:15.459> what<00:02:15.730> he

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
I don't agree with it but that's what he

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.460 
I don't agree with it but that's what he
believes<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.750> meme<00:02:16.930> says<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.349> look

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
believes it and this meme says we look

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.320 
believes it and this meme says we look
at<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.680> table<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.220> look<00:02:18.280> at<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> table<00:02:18.970> at

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.220 
at the table and look at the table at
the<00:02:19.480> last<00:02:20.140> time

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
good enough for me Trapattoni was

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.610 
good enough for me Trapattoni was
talking<00:04:12.760> before<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.569> game<00:04:13.599> about<00:04:13.810> Gibson<00:04:14.500> and

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
the role Gibson was gonna have and he

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.420 
the role Gibson was gonna have and he
was<00:04:16.840> gonna<00:04:17.019> shoot<00:04:17.380> because<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.980> he<00:04:18.220> felt

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
was gonna shoot because that he felt

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.390 
was gonna shoot because that he felt
that<00:04:18.609> was<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> weakness<00:04:19.239> in<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.630> Macedonian

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
that was a weakness in the Macedonian

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.129 
that was a weakness in the Macedonian
team<00:04:21.400> which<00:04:21.579> we<00:04:21.730> saw<00:04:21.910> clearly<00:04:22.389> demonstrated

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
team which we saw clearly demonstrated

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.159 
team which we saw clearly demonstrated
from<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.320> first<00:04:23.530> two<00:04:23.770> where<00:04:23.919> his<00:04:24.070> balls<00:04:25.169> but

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
from the first two where his balls but

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.870

kid sent Kingston has blown it I

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.909 
kid sent Kingston has blown it I
would've<00:04:28.150> thought<00:04:28.350> he<00:04:29.350> never<00:04:29.530> got<00:04:29.770> into

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
would've thought he never got into

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.160 
would've thought he never got into
