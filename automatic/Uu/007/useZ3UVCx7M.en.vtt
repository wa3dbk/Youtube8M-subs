00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello, my name is Putin Sergey 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.220
 I did not see courses for 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.160
 customers 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.839
 how to order a profitable website 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.289
 video courses 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.789
 in estonia ampoules 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.379
 lesson 118 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.379
 In this lesson I want to talk about who 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.460
 such a search engine algorithm 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.220
 overwhelming majority 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.689
 customers 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.009
 or do not understand at all or have 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.919
 vague idea of 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.310
 search engines work 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.239
 the vast majority of them 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.349
 mistakenly believe 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.880
 which was posted on the Internet 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.040
 will be immediately available 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.630
 in the results 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 search queries 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 in fact 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.460
 because m 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.360
 will be available 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.040
 in search results 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.000
 it needs to be offered 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 indexing 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 search engine database 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.280
 after that there must be some 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.360
 time while site 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.110
 indexed ie viewed 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.340
 search engine robots 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.930
 database will definitely be added by 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.160
 bases 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.320
 processed more accurately will be determined 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.650
 images processed 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.210
 information on a predetermined 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.510
 comparing 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.280
 with results 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.650
 processing 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.780
 other sites 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.250
 line up the resultant 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.490
 rating just 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.340
 it is exactly cell rating beacons that he sees in 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.070
 water 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.000
 search queries 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.010
 each search engine has its own way 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.770
 economics work algorithm which 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.750
 constantly changing and improving 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.040
 never was no and never will be no 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.670
 one 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.770
 in the end they said in the studio that they were 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.810
 all the details of the algorithm would be known 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.590
 work 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.300
 search engines 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.870
 any view that you are in the studio for years 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.080
 or you design 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.200
 known 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.800
 work algorithm 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.410
 search engines 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.249
 insignificant 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.249
 does not follow the empire 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.460
 search engine algorithm 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.080
 it is very complex and high-tech 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.360
 process 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.850
 certain 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 Abrams certain information processing 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.699
 which is available on 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:12.679
 in particular 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 always remember that 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.729
 This is a program that contains both 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.279
 directly 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.279
 program code 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:25.799
 semantic part that is 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.109
 site content 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.279
 and one of the tasks of search engines is 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.779
 will clean 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.779
 n and split 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.789
 website content from software code and 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.579
 in a certain way her 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.930
 the consequence of working 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.899
 and ranking 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.729
 next to know what 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.799
 developers 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.409
 search engines 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.269
 often 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.189
 use not only 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.399
 waste 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.759
 ranking mechanisms 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.259
 reg 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.389
 legs 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.329
 constantly experimenting 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.189
 and in some cases 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.939
 site ranking changes 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.769
 i.e. changes in the operation algorithm 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.149
 search engine 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.589
 leads to the fact that in this regard 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.529
 may suddenly climb the stairs 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.399
 this is often used in particular 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.399
 some in estonia who 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.869
 by customer what 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 who have received advice support 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.319
 designer st or you soon managed 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.910
 promote a site 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.799
 in fact 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.739
 rating of any advice will be periodically 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.299
 change over time even if no 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.649
 changes on the site 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.139
 in particular there is such 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:35.859
 term like 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.989
 floating rating sites 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.840
 over developing search engine algorithms 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.719
 the system has a large group 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.159
 experts than the popular search 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.619
 system, the more such specialists 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:47.429
 various 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.699
 marketing research 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.479
 research polls and so on 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.809
 in all cases 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.069
 to achieve quality 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.839
 output results 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.789
 this is called relevance 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.529
 risky requests that is 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:01.949
 respectively 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.719
 results 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.009
 in search queries expectations 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.679
 search engines 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.809
 it takes time 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:11.729
 strength 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:12.949
 knowledge 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.389
 big money 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.389
 search engine algorithm 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.150
 guarded 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.479
 commercial information 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.479
 it is useless to try to find on the Internet 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:28.810
 works 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.810
 this or that search engines 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.559
 Internet search engine works 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:37.699
 can't find 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.490
 if the search engine owners 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.150
 published this form 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
 there would be a lot of wishing 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.229
 Any ingenious ways to 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.849
 promote your site 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.370
 and level up 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.010
 Naturally publications such 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.389
 information would not be appropriate 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.770
 search engine using search spam and and 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.249
 quality of results 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.249
 sharpness will be reduced 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.849
 many years measurements 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.229
 some ingenious ways 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.930
 that allow you to buy the league site 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.760
 trying to unravel the secrets 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.039
 search engines work algorithm 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.839
 in most cases this leads 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:20.860
 because 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.849
 in commitment use 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.760
 forbidden in terms of 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.870
 specific search engine methods 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.279
 In most cases, this is search engine spam. 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.310
 the customer does not need to know 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.509
 subtleties 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.620
 and secrets 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.770
 ranging 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.289
 search engines work algorithm 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.740
 it is important for them to have only a general idea 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.949
 and get rid of the main people 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.520
 which 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.479
 with which their ideas about 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.690
 how to promote a website how much to invest 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.460
 in him money for what to pay special 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.510
 attention to 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.479
 training promotion support sites 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.289
 all other questions must fulfill 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.469
 professional commitment specialists 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:01.540
 which is engaged 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.759
 website promotion support 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.199
 like measuring 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.830
 n it is important to get the customer here 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.699
 content 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:11.750
 from content 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.729
 will depend on 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.669
 site success and content 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.050
 and is taken into account in the algorithm work 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.189
 search engines are content 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.990
 in most cases it determines 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.599
 work of this or that site 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.169
 more about the algorithm 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.159
 search engines can be read as 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.020
 on official sites 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.969
 popular search engines 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:33.759
 so neither 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.319
 for example in the section 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.919
 in contour history 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:37.279
 in place
