this<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:53.270> be<00:02:53.330> done<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> lot<00:02:53.990> of<00:02:54.050> ways<00:02:54.290> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
this can be done a lot of ways and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.140 
this can be done a lot of ways and
however<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.400> tend<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.910> very

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
however you like I tend to like the very

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.240 
however you like I tend to like the very
sleek<00:02:56.660> look<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.140> dragons<00:02:59.950> though<00:03:00.950> they<00:03:01.070> have<00:03:01.220> a

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
sleek look to dragons though they have a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
serpentine probably again there's a lot

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.810 
serpentine probably again there's a lot
of<00:03:11.720> influence<00:03:12.140> on<00:03:12.350> from<00:03:13.040> monitor<00:03:13.460> lizards

here Komodo dragons and the like I have

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.610 
here Komodo dragons and the like I have
an<00:03:19.550> affection<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.240> doing<00:03:20.540> pupil<00:03:20.990> assign

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
an affection for doing pupil assign

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.640 
an affection for doing pupil assign
dragons<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.190> make<00:03:22.310> them<00:03:22.430> look<00:03:22.580> more<00:03:22.640> mystical

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
dragons to make them look more mystical

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.900 
dragons to make them look more mystical
but<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:24.740> you're<00:03:24.860> wanting<00:03:25.430> something<00:03:25.790> that

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
but if you're wanting something that

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.990 
but if you're wanting something that
looks<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.270> more<00:03:26.510> like<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.690> real<00:03:26.960> animal

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
looks a little more like a real animal

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.490 
looks a little more like a real animal
then<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.180> might<00:03:29.390> want<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.630> do<00:03:30.310> snake-like

then you might want to do snake-like
slitted<00:03:33.940> pupils<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.230> tend<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.260> give<00:03:36.440> two<00:03:36.830> very

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
slitted pupils I tend to give two very

slitted pupils I tend to give two very
big<00:03:37.340> horns<00:03:39.670> but<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:40.940> do<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.060> as<00:03:41.210> a<00:03:41.240> single

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
big horns but you can do it as a single

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
ones around the jawline give a nice

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.280 
ones around the jawline give a nice
touch<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.530> good<00:03:52.460> series<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:53.030> ridges<00:03:53.290> that

touch and a good series of ridges that

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.500 
touch and a good series of ridges that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
start maybe at the brow Ridge or even at

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.640 
start maybe at the brow Ridge or even at
the<00:03:56.600> tip<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.990> nose<00:03:57.340> go<00:03:58.340> all<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.700> way<00:03:58.730> down

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
the tip of the nose go all the way down

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.870 
the tip of the nose go all the way down
this<00:04:00.650> guy's<00:04:00.890> twisting<00:04:01.340> his<00:04:01.430> neck<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.760> they're

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
this guy's twisting his neck so they're

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.300 
this guy's twisting his neck so they're
going<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.030> come<00:04:02.180> back<00:04:02.360> around<00:04:02.510> here<00:04:03.310> get

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
going to come back around here get

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.000 
going to come back around here get
largest<00:04:04.790> across<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.240> back<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.560> go<00:04:06.680> all<00:04:06.890> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
largest across the back and go all the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.340 
largest across the back and go all the
way<00:04:08.230> down<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.440> tail<00:04:09.650> again<00:04:09.860> look<00:04:10.220> at<00:04:10.280> some

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
way down the tail again look at some

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.040 
way down the tail again look at some
dinosaur<00:04:12.350> shots<00:04:12.680> for<00:04:13.330> more<00:04:14.330> ideas<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:14.840> this

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
dinosaur shots for more ideas on this

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.010 
dinosaur shots for more ideas on this
then<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:15.650> have<00:04:15.800> our<00:04:15.890> wings<00:04:16.750> wings<00:04:17.750> are

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
then we have our wings wings are

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.570 
then we have our wings wings are
basically<00:04:18.440> follow<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.799> bat<00:04:19.040> wings<00:04:19.280> they<00:04:19.459> have

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
basically follow a bat wings they have

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.120 
basically follow a bat wings they have
an<00:04:19.700> elbow<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:21.700> then<00:04:22.700> essentially<00:04:23.180> fingers

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
an elbow and then essentially fingers

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.040 
an elbow and then essentially fingers
all<00:04:25.130> stem<00:04:25.580> from<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.910> same<00:04:26.870> spot

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
all stem from that same spot

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.760 
all stem from that same spot
again<00:04:30.009> this<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.310> good<00:04:30.430> way<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.610> get<00:04:30.819> it<00:04:31.770> to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
again this is a good way to get it to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.779 
again this is a good way to get it to
look<00:04:32.949> more<00:04:33.009> like<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.430> real<00:04:33.729> animal<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.360> way

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
look more like a real animal that way

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.939 
look more like a real animal that way
you<00:04:36.789> can<00:04:37.060> do<00:04:37.300> dragon<00:04:37.659> wings<00:04:37.840> any<00:04:38.199> just<00:04:38.800> about

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
you can do dragon wings any just about

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.360 
you can do dragon wings any just about
any<00:04:39.129> way<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:39.310> want<00:04:39.580> really<00:04:39.970> but<00:04:41.370> they're

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
any way you want really but they're

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.010 
any way you want really but they're
depicted<00:04:43.330> lots<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.990> different<00:04:44.289> ways<00:04:46.020> that's

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
depicted lots of different ways that's

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.930 
depicted lots of different ways that's
your<00:04:47.139> basic<00:04:47.409> lesson<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.889> how<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.639> draw<00:04:48.909> a
