00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
um just refer back to our previous

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.160 
um just refer back to our previous
tactical<00:03:31.120> knife<00:03:31.269> lessons<00:03:31.720> with<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> care<00:03:32.140> of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
tactical knife lessons with the care of

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.289 
tactical knife lessons with the care of
it<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.130> can<00:03:33.310> see<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.730> we<00:03:33.820> can<00:03:33.970> use<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
it and you can see that we can use the

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.960 
it and you can see that we can use the
same<00:03:34.510> technique<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.890> thing<00:03:36.549> here<00:03:36.820> is

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
same technique to this thing here is

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.449 
same technique to this thing here is
more<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.420> dagger<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.110> if<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.010> use<00:03:39.220> it

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
more like a dagger and if you use it

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.530 
more like a dagger and if you use it
remember<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.630> utilize<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:42.299> pointy<00:03:43.299> tip

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
remember to utilize the pointy tip

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.809 
remember to utilize the pointy tip
instead<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.590> blade<00:03:44.890> edge

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
instead of the blade edge

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.479 
instead of the blade edge
this<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.780> fine<00:03:47.049> edge<00:03:47.260> here<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.859> more<00:03:48.189> as<00:03:48.310> a

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
this this fine edge here is more as a

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.449 
this this fine edge here is more as a
young<00:03:49.829> backup<00:03:50.829> slicing<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.780> also<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:53.079> for

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
young backup slicing and also it's for

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.509 
young backup slicing and also it's for
stabbing<00:03:54.459> through<00:03:55.120> something<00:03:55.689> easily<00:03:56.519> okay

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
stabbing through something easily okay

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.360 
stabbing through something easily okay
so<00:03:57.579> we<00:03:57.939> can<00:03:58.120> use<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.359> as<00:03:58.689> a<00:03:58.749> stabbing<00:03:59.260> tool<00:03:59.680> just

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
so we can use it as a stabbing tool just

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.069 
so we can use it as a stabbing tool just
like<00:04:00.489> our<00:04:00.790> previous<00:04:00.969> lecture<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.870> lecture

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
like our previous lecture the lecture

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.640 
like our previous lecture the lecture
said<00:04:02.560> they<00:04:03.099> take<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.519> grid<00:04:03.790> with<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.349> X

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
said they take the grid with with the X

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.879 
said they take the grid with with the X
and<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.189> cross<00:04:06.489> okay<00:04:07.329> here<00:04:08.319> will<00:04:08.530> be

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
and the cross okay here will be

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.410 
and the cross okay here will be
defending<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.519> left<00:04:09.849> side

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
defending the left side

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.849 
defending the left side
you<00:04:10.689> can't<00:04:10.870> defend<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.260> left<00:04:11.439> side<00:04:11.620> like<00:04:11.829> so

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
you can't defend the left side like so

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.430 
you can't defend the left side like so
poke<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:14.019> this<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.500> then<00:04:14.709> slice<00:04:16.169> see<00:04:17.169> very

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
poke like this and then slice see very

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.580 
poke like this and then slice see very
practical<00:04:18.099> just<00:04:18.609> turn<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.449> turn<00:04:20.079> your<00:04:20.380> waist
