what<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.160> went<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:38.489> when<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.670> went<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
what we went through when we went to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
what we went through when we went to
rhine<00:00:39.120> neck<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.600> knew<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
rhine neck or we knew that they had a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
rhine neck or we knew that they had a
long<00:00:40.559> layover<00:00:40.860> didn't<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.790> how<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> would

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
long layover didn't know how that would

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.250 
long layover didn't know how that would
affect<00:00:42.180> their<00:00:42.510> team<00:00:42.690> coming<00:00:42.930> out<00:00:43.110> they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
affect their team coming out they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
affect their team coming out they
actually<00:00:43.620> came<00:00:43.770> out<00:00:43.829> very<00:00:44.219> well<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> think

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
actually came out very well but I think

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.430 
actually came out very well but I think
that<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.600> didn't<00:00:45.840> weren't<00:00:45.989> able<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> sustain

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
that they didn't weren't able to sustain

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
that they didn't weren't able to sustain
it<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.829> four<00:00:47.129> quarters<00:00:47.510> we've<00:00:48.510> got<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> bounce

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it for four quarters we've got to bounce

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
it for four quarters we've got to bounce
right<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.140> importantly<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> practice<00:00:50.579> right

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
right back importantly to practice right

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
right back importantly to practice right
now<00:00:50.789> leading<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.719> sure<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.020> we

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
now leading on to it make sure that we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.860 
now leading on to it make sure that we
get<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.620> physicality<00:00:53.579> back<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
get a physicality back get into that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.529 
get a physicality back get into that
same<00:00:55.410> rhythm<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> even<00:00:56.550> though<00:00:56.699> we

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
same rhythm that we have even though we

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200 
same rhythm that we have even though we
lost<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.079> last<00:00:58.289> game<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.649> think<00:00:58.850> just<00:00:59.850> it's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
lost that last game I think just it's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.700 
lost that last game I think just it's
almost<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.660> last<00:01:00.870> week<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.170> were<00:01:01.289> back<00:01:01.469> into

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
almost like last week we were back into

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
almost like last week we were back into

this<00:01:07.650> coach<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.400> time<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.240> help<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
this coach the time off will help the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
team for the playoff drive they're
definitely<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.090> rhythm

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

playing<00:01:15.630> six<00:01:15.900> weeks<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.409> uh<00:01:16.439> us<00:01:17.040> having<00:01:17.369> three
