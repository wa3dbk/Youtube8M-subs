00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.829
 because not everyone called Burmeister Inga von Hark and today show through 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.279
 in my ears 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.279
 great unity 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.490
 we do it like this 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.659
 why should we have a big one from the outside 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.310
 for the following reason 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.130
 Dust accumulates 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.439
 in Langenlois 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.369
 our suggestions 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.609
 then it comes 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.349
 and serve immediately 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.649
 to prevent that 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.550
 is a pure one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.000
 impossible and the first step is to dismantle the coffers 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.070
 to read 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 the stop in the eye, then 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 let us have to learn 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.900
 that had died are the hand 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.950
 here Sebastian could 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 Cortina come in now 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.220
 so thats it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.769
 Until next time 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.439
 European Burmeister in October
