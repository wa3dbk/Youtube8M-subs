instead of utilizing a clothespin or a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.800 
instead of utilizing a clothespin or a
clip<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.130> actual<00:01:14.580> plant<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.630> some

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
clip on the actual plant is because some

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.030 
clip on the actual plant is because some
guests<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.350> always<00:01:16.619> feel<00:01:17.009> comfortable

giving<00:01:17.820> money<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.930> those<00:01:19.049> cases<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.770> can

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
giving money and in those cases you can

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
giving money and in those cases you can
just<00:01:19.950> allow<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> guest<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> give<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.900> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
just allow the guest to give a little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100

they can put that in the envelope

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.130 
they can put that in the envelope
instead<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.360> money<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:27.900> feel

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
