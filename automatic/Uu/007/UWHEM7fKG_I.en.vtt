00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello, today's anboxing will 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:21.660
 from China this program we will see 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 what a program so well I certainly know 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.180
 that their west amateur just see 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.180
 what's really there 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:14.970
 let's start with the programmer tel 866 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 so with the letter and I ordered 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 it means they have a psp connector 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:35.100
 here's the two programming 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.910
 boxes of course no more hard 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.080
 my friend 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 I thought it would be easier well here review 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.050
 really introductory today i'm nothing 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 I will not program next 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:56.430
 what to memorize take off about this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 seeing what we have here but here this 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.990
 the connector just plugs in here 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.250
 motherboard that is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.540
 motherboards that support 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.250
 Immediately you can not stick 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 program flash bios 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:26.360
 calmly so further what we have here 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.360
 full of panels panels means it is with us 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.610
 anelka 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.750
 from 28 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:03:05.390
 28 conclusions we have from 44 water 8 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.390
 leg you and sop8 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:17.900
 so why different size yes here 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.900
 such with us 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:33.480
 Chip Remover 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.600
 bag 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.600
 most likely also the first and bends 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.430
 Yes 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:11.780
 and dates 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:14.720
 so here is such a transition here 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.700
 either the chip is required or you can 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.320
 somehow clamp there with a clothespin or else 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:29.840
 something that means with us 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:33.250
 pilsen 20 28 and 32 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.640
 that the two do not need fame in the ground and 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:42.140
 these ones 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:45.710
 in particular 8 I have already ordered 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.490
 to the heap was but what then problems 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.500
 did not arise that there is no adapter under 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.320
 some kind of chip from this i couldn't 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.600
 forgive 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:04.220
 Well, here is a small review 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:08.590
 unboxing so to speak in the next video 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.410
 About reflash some 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.100
