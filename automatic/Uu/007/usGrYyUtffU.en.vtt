00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
and that's what I really early thought

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.079 
and that's what I really early thought
of<00:00:58.379> beyond<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.870> where<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.500> uh<00:01:01.850> center<00:01:02.850> town

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
of beyond this where we uh center town

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.100 
of beyond this where we uh center town
this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> Beach<00:01:04.320> Hotel<00:01:05.870> where<00:01:06.870> things

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
this is the Beach Hotel where things

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.310 
this is the Beach Hotel where things
usually<00:01:07.530> kick<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:08.659> early<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.870> night<00:01:10.050> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
usually kick off early in the night I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.899 
usually kick off early in the night I
understand<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.800> till<00:01:10.950> about<00:01:11.010> 12:30<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.790> then

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
understand it till about 12:30 and then

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
understand it till about 12:30 and then
everything<00:01:12.390> gets<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.659> booth<00:01:12.810> weed<00:01:13.080> after

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
everything gets the booth weed after

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
everything gets the booth weed after
that<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> first<00:01:14.970> time<00:01:15.120> I<00:01:15.210> ever<00:01:15.360> met

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that I think the first time I ever met

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.730 
that I think the first time I ever met
him<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.810> actually<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.290> were<00:01:16.380> walking<00:01:16.590> down

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
him was actually we were walking down

him was actually we were walking down
the<00:01:16.890> trail<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:17.280> broken<00:01:17.520> head<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.030> pretty

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the trail two broken head it's pretty

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.970 
the trail two broken head it's pretty
funny<00:01:18.510> because<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.050> Dion<00:01:19.470> kept<00:01:19.710> asking

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
funny because I think Dion kept asking

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.230 
funny because I think Dion kept asking
me<00:01:20.070> questions<00:01:20.430> about<00:01:20.490> cameras<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.210> were
