there's a fresh bed right here that was

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
there's a fresh bed right here that was
probably<00:00:53.610> used<00:00:53.910> within<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> last<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.960> maybe

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
probably used within the last two maybe

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.349 
probably used within the last two maybe
three<00:00:55.680> days<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.219> mean<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.730> couldn't<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.180> ask

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
three days I mean we couldn't really ask

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
three days I mean we couldn't really ask
for<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> better<00:01:00.719> spot<00:01:01.050> we're<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.980> pretty<00:01:02.309> good

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
for a better spot we're on a pretty good

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.009 
for a better spot we're on a pretty good
area<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.120> where<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.660> set<00:01:03.930> up

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
area here where we think we can set up

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
area here where we think we can set up
the<00:01:04.049> cam<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.220> pretty<00:01:05.729> straight<00:01:06.090> tree

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the cam and on this pretty straight tree

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.920 
the cam and on this pretty straight tree
back<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.810> um<00:01:08.360> come<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.479> find<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.750> there's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
back here um come to find out there's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
back here um come to find out there's
actually<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.729> pretty<00:01:11.729> heavily<00:01:12.060> used<00:01:12.420> trail

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
actually a pretty heavily used trail

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
actually a pretty heavily used trail
that<00:01:13.470> looks<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.040> probably<00:01:14.460> been<00:01:14.700> used

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that looks like it's probably been used

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690 
that looks like it's probably been used
year<00:01:15.900> after<00:01:16.049> year<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.650> gosh<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.430> at

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
year after year for gosh probably at

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
year after year for gosh probably at
least<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> last<00:01:18.119> five<00:01:18.390> six<00:01:19.020> years<00:01:20.689> we<00:01:22.159> also

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
least the last five six years we also

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.910 
least the last five six years we also
discovered<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.119> there's<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.380> actually

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
discovered that there's some actually

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.469 
discovered that there's some actually
some<00:01:26.100> pretty<00:01:26.490> fresh<00:01:26.759> tracks<00:01:27.119> we've<00:01:27.330> been

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
some pretty fresh tracks we've been

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
some pretty fresh tracks we've been
having<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> lot<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.900> rain<00:01:28.200> lately<00:01:28.439> these<00:01:29.310> are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
having a lot of rain lately these are

having a lot of rain lately these are
some<00:01:29.490> pretty<00:01:29.759> substantial<00:01:30.079> tracks<00:01:31.079> hopefully

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
some pretty substantial tracks hopefully

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
some pretty substantial tracks hopefully
it's<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.220> big<00:01:32.850> boys<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.390> our

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's one of these big boys that our

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.249 
it's one of these big boys that our
photographer<00:01:34.470> got<00:01:34.650> some<00:01:34.829> pictures<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:36.259> well

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
photographer got some pictures of well

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
photographer got some pictures of well
we<00:01:37.590> ended<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.009> finding<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> pretty<00:01:38.850> straight

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
we ended up finding a pretty straight

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.410 
we ended up finding a pretty straight
tree<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> loop<00:01:41.340> hold<00:01:41.549> rcx<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
tree here we got the loop hold rcx to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
tree here we got the loop hold rcx to
put<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.350> guy<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> street<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.850> right

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
put this guy up on the street all right

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.080 
put this guy up on the street all right
well<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> RCX<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> tree

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
well we got the RCX to up on the tree

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.069 
well we got the RCX to up on the tree
normally<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.240> point<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> got<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
normally at this point what you got to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.179 
normally at this point what you got to
do<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> got<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> lot<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> guesswork

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
do is you got to do a lot of guesswork

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.219 
do is you got to do a lot of guesswork
you<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.790> can't<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.180> tell<00:01:51.450> where
