00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.480

 wesker I wanted to end mankind 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.250
 will save it from the virus with the passage of 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.890
 time we will find cherry that came out 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.120
 in the newly level 2 although it was the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.400
 little girl that is now a 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.920
 teenager will walk she will be our 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.020
 partner in this adventure we will find 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.150
 to cris and others the characters that come 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.100
 in the saga as we will see the resemblance is 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.620
 incredible in addition to the jacket that 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.300
 sees neck and neck the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.150
 Faces types of the faces are very 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.450
 similar and I think they were based on 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.200
 Eminem by making this character chic 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.930
 let's go to position number 3 james in 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.050
 blue and lion kennedy is curious this 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.390
 issue since it was rumored in networks of the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.940
 movie resident evil 4 art after life 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.480
 Jensen who if you will be the one 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.130
 will interpret the character read a scanner 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.730
 that for some reasons he 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.739
 no longer acted in the 4 that by the way already 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.799
 came out movie 5 that he either 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.480
 he played the lion was another actor that 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.050
 it was a great pity since I feel that 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.140
 this person 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.080
 for who had stayed so very 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.240
 fine since if they really look like and 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.900
 being charged the directors of the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.400
 movies just to not have it then as 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.790
 a character in the history of 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.520
 and although average came out just hybrids 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:39.120
 only in four and only 16 that already 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.460
 came out in this long kennedy video game and 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 many other recent and new bills 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.160
 generation level that is a movie 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.229
 animated of resident evil and etcetera 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.910
 dietzen acklins that has come out in 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.830
 supernatural 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.960
 and it 's good and in many other series 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.370
 it took a disappointment is what happened 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.100
 since I feel that the paper had 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.930
 stayed perfect well up here the 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.840
 today's video if you have another 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.580
 opinion on or good, others are factors 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.200
 we are that it resembles a person who 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.630
 this video game please tell me the 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.770
 superior and unfair video and says goodbye 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.770
 and cruise 7
