almost all builds you want to be getting
a<00:00:57.890> 10<00:00:58.100> depot<00:00:58.490> and<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:59.720> choose<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.350> build<00:01:00.530> the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
a 10 depot and I choose to build the

a 10 depot and I choose to build the
steep<00:01:00.860> 0<00:01:00.980> at<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.220> wall<00:01:01.370> there's<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.420> lot<00:01:02.630> of

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
steep 0 at the wall there's a lot of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.200 
steep 0 at the wall there's a lot of
players<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.470> know<00:01:03.530> mkp<00:01:04.339> for<00:01:04.670> instance<00:01:04.970> marine

King<00:01:05.420> prime<00:01:05.630> definitely<00:01:06.079> does<00:01:06.200> not<00:01:06.229> wall<00:01:06.619> off

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
King prime definitely does not wall off

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.700 
King prime definitely does not wall off
at<00:01:07.460> all<00:01:07.729> with<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.119> but<00:01:08.899> I<00:01:08.930> feel<00:01:09.470> more

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
at all with this but I feel more

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.719 
at all with this but I feel more
comfortable<00:01:09.920> doing<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:10.520> that's<00:01:10.640> a

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
comfortable doing it so that's a

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.399 
comfortable doing it so that's a
personal<00:01:11.060> preference<00:01:11.299> but<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.930> important

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
personal preference but the important

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.139 
personal preference but the important
thing<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.829> that<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.460> barracks<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.000> end

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
thing is that the barracks that you end

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.120 
thing is that the barracks that you end
up<00:01:14.240> building<00:01:14.420> at<00:01:14.689> 12<00:01:14.960> supply<00:01:15.380> which<00:01:15.680> we'll<00:01:15.890> see

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
up building at 12 supply which we'll see

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.810 
up building at 12 supply which we'll see
go<00:01:16.460> down<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.909> second<00:01:17.380> right<00:01:18.380> here<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.950> not<00:01:19.490> at

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
go down in a second right here is not at

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.510 
go down in a second right here is not at
the<00:01:20.180> wall<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.920> there's<00:01:21.920> multiple<00:01:22.340> reasons

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
the wall and there's multiple reasons

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.399 
the wall and there's multiple reasons
for<00:01:22.909> that<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.300> we'll<00:01:23.540> talk<00:01:23.750> about<00:01:23.900> them<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.229> a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
for that and we'll talk about them in a

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.920 
for that and we'll talk about them in a
second<00:01:24.770> but<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.760> barracks<00:01:26.150> should<00:01:26.510> not<00:01:26.720> be

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
second but this barracks should not be

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.469 
second but this barracks should not be
at<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.200> wall<00:01:27.729> whereas<00:01:28.729> this<00:01:28.970> Depot<00:01:29.270> just

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
at the wall whereas this Depot just

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.840 
at the wall whereas this Depot just
personal<00:01:29.810> preference<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.760> this

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
personal preference and so for this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.430 
personal preference and so for this
build<00:01:32.120> like<00:01:32.360> we<00:01:32.479> said<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:32.810> not<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> one<00:01:33.229> racks

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
build like we said it's not a one racks

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.770 
build like we said it's not a one racks
Fe<00:01:33.799> this<00:01:34.010> build<00:01:34.220> pushes<00:01:35.030> early<00:01:35.360> with<00:01:35.510> murano

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
Fe this build pushes early with murano

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.440 
Fe this build pushes early with murano
zamorano<00:01:36.229> slow<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.799> at<00:01:36.920> 13<00:01:37.370> supply<00:01:37.760> right

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
zamorano slow so at 13 supply right

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.120 
zamorano slow so at 13 supply right
around<00:01:38.630> here<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.260> actually<00:01:39.409> do<00:01:39.710> get<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.979> gas

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
around here we actually do get the gas

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.899 
around here we actually do get the gas
geyser<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:42.590> your<00:01:42.799> opponent<00:01:43.280> ends<00:01:43.790> up

some sort of early medevac or hellions

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.410 
some sort of early medevac or hellions
there's<00:01:55.549> a<00:01:55.610> lot<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.850> different<00:01:55.970> things

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
there's a lot of different things

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.500 
there's a lot of different things
Terrans<00:01:56.869> can<00:01:57.140> do<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.650> be<00:01:58.159> tricky<00:01:58.549> with<00:01:58.580> this

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
Terrans can do and be tricky with this

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.940 
Terrans can do and be tricky with this
is<00:02:00.020> definitely<00:02:00.350> one<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.560> more<00:02:00.650> stable

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
is definitely one of the more stable

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.950 
is definitely one of the more stable
things<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.490> can<00:02:01.700> do<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.390> there's<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.689> lot<00:02:02.930> of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
things you can do but there's a lot of

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.800 
things you can do but there's a lot of
options<00:02:03.500> Terran<00:02:03.799> has<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.580> not<00:02:05.180> seeing<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
options Terran has so not seeing the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.570 
options Terran has so not seeing the
add-on<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.260> this<00:02:06.409> barracks<00:02:06.799> is<00:02:06.979> very

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
add-on and this barracks is very

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.160 
add-on and this barracks is very
important<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.269> that's<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.720> reason<00:02:09.019> why<00:02:09.049> this

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
important and that's the reason why this

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.520 
important and that's the reason why this
barracks<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:09.979> not<00:02:10.129> at<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.939> wall<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:12.260> soon<00:02:12.409> as

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
barracks is not at the wall as soon as

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.289 
barracks is not at the wall as soon as
you<00:02:12.680> get<00:02:12.799> your<00:02:12.860> murine<00:02:13.370> done<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.090> want<00:02:14.239> to

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
you get your murine done you want to

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.890 
you get your murine done you want to
start<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:14.569> orbital<00:02:14.900> command<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.560> then

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
start your orbital command and then

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.470 
start your orbital command and then
instantly<00:02:17.900> start<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.590> barracks<00:02:19.239> rather<00:02:20.239> your

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
instantly start to barracks rather your

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.910 
instantly start to barracks rather your
second<00:02:20.870> barracks

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
second barracks

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.730 
second barracks
and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.580> finally<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.180> can<00:02:23.390> scout<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
and then finally you can scout the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.170 
and then finally you can scout the
reason<00:02:25.069> for<00:02:25.099> this<00:02:25.250> late<00:02:25.490> scout<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.000> just

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
reason for this late scout is you just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.550 
reason for this late scout is you just
don't<00:02:26.239> have<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.690> means<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.380> this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
don't have the means to do all this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.140 
don't have the means to do all this
stuff<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.040> regardless<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.880> what<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
stuff and regardless of what the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.190 
stuff and regardless of what the
opponent's<00:02:29.510> doing<00:02:29.720> they're<00:02:29.840> still<00:02:30.020> going<00:02:30.110> to

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
opponent's doing they're still going to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.130 
opponent's doing they're still going to
be<00:02:30.260> doing<00:02:30.349> this<00:02:30.560> build<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.130> point<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.630> right

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
be doing this build to a point so right

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.220 
be doing this build to a point so right
here<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:34.130> your<00:02:34.280> first<00:02:34.750> marine<00:02:35.750> done<00:02:36.050> you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
here with your first marine done you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.839 
here with your first marine done you
want<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.470> start<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> reactor<00:02:37.160> over<00:02:37.370> here<00:02:37.610> and

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
want to start a reactor over here and

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.280 
want to start a reactor over here and
then<00:02:37.970> finally<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.600> start<00:02:38.840> your<00:02:38.959> depot

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
then finally you can start your depot

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.020 
then finally you can start your depot
it's<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.890> little<00:02:40.160> bit<00:02:40.310> close<00:02:40.610> you'll<00:02:40.850> see<00:02:41.000> i

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's a little bit close you'll see i

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.910 
it's a little bit close you'll see i
might<00:02:41.239> get<00:02:41.330> supply<00:02:41.630> block<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.110> second<00:02:42.530> but

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
might get supply block for a second but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.890 
might get supply block for a second but
if<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.400> don't<00:02:43.640> wall<00:02:43.880> off<00:02:44.060> with<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.540> Depot

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
if you don't wall off with that Depot

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.410 
if you don't wall off with that Depot
you'll<00:02:45.080> have<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.350> they<00:02:45.560> fitted<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.420> have

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
you'll have time they fitted in and have

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.880 
you'll have time they fitted in and have
zero<00:02:47.810> problems<00:02:48.200> with<00:02:48.350> getting<00:02:48.470> supply

zero problems with getting supply

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.860 
zero problems with getting supply

this<00:02:51.019> whole<00:02:51.200> thing<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:52.069> reactor<00:02:52.849> goes<00:02:53.000> down

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
this whole thing but reactor goes down

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.910 
this whole thing but reactor goes down
on<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.630> first<00:02:53.930> barracks<00:02:54.290> immediately

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
on this first barracks immediately

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.710 
on this first barracks immediately
followed<00:02:55.190> by<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.340> Depot<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.880> then<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.569> get<00:02:56.660> a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
followed by a Depot and then you get a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.050 
followed by a Depot and then you get a
tech<00:02:56.959> lab<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.500> second<00:02:57.950> one<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.730> reason

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
tech lab on the second one the reason

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.240 
tech lab on the second one the reason
for<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.600> that<00:02:59.630> your<00:03:00.110> combat<00:03:00.709> sorry<00:03:01.100> your

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
for this is that your combat sorry your

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.520 
for this is that your combat sorry your
concussive<00:03:01.610> shells<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.510> your<00:03:02.810> timing<00:03:03.140> attack

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
concussive shells is your timing attack

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.530 
concussive shells is your timing attack
however<00:03:04.010> if<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.790> push<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.180> just<00:03:05.330> one

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
however if you push with just one

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.970 
however if you push with just one
Marauder<00:03:05.900> then<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.350> have<00:03:06.530> nothing<00:03:06.709> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
Marauder then you have nothing to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.100 
Marauder then you have nothing to
actually<00:03:07.220> micro<00:03:07.940> with<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.540> by<00:03:08.750> getting<00:03:09.019> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
actually micro with if by getting the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.570 
actually micro with if by getting the
reactor<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:09.650> early<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.069> end<00:03:10.220> up<00:03:10.280> getting<00:03:10.400> a

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
reactor this early you end up getting a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.289 
reactor this early you end up getting a
bunch<00:03:10.790> more<00:03:11.000> Marines<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:12.880> was<00:03:13.880> probably<00:03:14.180> too

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
bunch more Marines I was probably too

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.539 
bunch more Marines I was probably too
busy<00:03:14.420> my<00:03:14.600> kind<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.019> scat<00:03:15.260> good<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:16.160> get<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
busy my kind of scat good you get a

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.430 
busy my kind of scat good you get a
bunch<00:03:16.850> more<00:03:17.120> Marines<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.720> actually<00:03:17.989> microwave

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
bunch more Marines to actually microwave

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.160 
bunch more Marines to actually microwave
and<00:03:18.620> trade<00:03:18.799> effectively<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.630> that's<00:03:20.959> why

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
and trade effectively and so that's why

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.140 
and trade effectively and so that's why
you<00:03:21.230> get<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.470> reactor<00:03:21.890> first<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.760> as<00:03:22.910> soon<00:03:23.030> as

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
you get the reactor first so as soon as

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.550 
you get the reactor first so as soon as
the<00:03:23.269> reactor<00:03:23.569> finishes<00:03:23.989> double<00:03:24.319> marine

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
the reactor finishes double marine

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.840 
the reactor finishes double marine
production<00:03:25.069> as<00:03:25.190> soon<00:03:25.340> as<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> tech<00:03:25.700> lab

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
production as soon as the tech lab

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.819 
production as soon as the tech lab
finishes<00:03:26.329> single<00:03:26.780> morado<00:03:27.079> production<00:03:27.620> and

the second Marauder comes and then you

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.360 
the second Marauder comes and then you
see<00:04:08.930> this<00:04:09.079> is<00:04:09.200> when<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.530> grab<00:04:09.739> everything<00:04:10.040> you

see this is when you grab everything you

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.590 
see this is when you grab everything you
get<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.609> together<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.120> just<00:04:11.269> move<00:04:11.450> out

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
get it together and you just move out

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.319 
get it together and you just move out
sometimes<00:04:12.350> you<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:12.709> pull<00:04:13.190> one<00:04:13.430> s<00:04:13.579> EV<00:04:13.910> but<00:04:14.180> you

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
sometimes you can pull one s EV but you

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.210 
sometimes you can pull one s EV but you
see<00:04:14.510> in<00:04:14.600> this<00:04:14.720> game<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.260> actually<00:04:15.560> have<00:04:15.859> an<00:04:15.950> SUV

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
see in this game I actually have an SUV

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.710 
see in this game I actually have an SUV
at<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.519> watchtower<00:04:16.910> still<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.359> I'm<00:04:17.450> just

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
at the watchtower still so I'm just

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.319 
at the watchtower still so I'm just
going<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.959> pull<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.260> one<00:04:18.440> this<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.940> SCB

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
going to pull that one this is a the SCB

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.990 
going to pull that one this is a the SCB
gives<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.690> opportunity<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.260> bunker<00:04:21.650> rush

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
gives you the opportunity to bunker rush

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.190 
gives you the opportunity to bunker rush
but<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.120> general<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.570> just<00:04:23.780> won't<00:04:23.930> have<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
but in general you just won't have the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.080 
but in general you just won't have the
money<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.680> actually<00:04:24.860> make<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.370> effective<00:04:25.820> so

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
money to actually make that effective so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.820 
money to actually make that effective so
really<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.870> don't<00:04:27.020> want<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.200> commit<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.560> doing

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
really you don't want to commit to doing
it<00:04:28.130> unless<00:04:28.340> you're<00:04:28.580> going<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.760> pull<00:04:28.940> like<00:04:29.090> all

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
build that can be kind of like a mind

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.360 
build that can be kind of like a mind
game<00:04:35.810> thing<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.259> know<00:04:36.319> flash<00:04:36.650> did<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:37.039> versus

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
game thing I know flash did that versus

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.879 
game thing I know flash did that versus
Nani<00:04:37.580> law<00:04:37.789> recently<00:04:38.060> but<00:04:38.900> certain<00:04:39.860> things

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
Nani law recently but certain things

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.850 
Nani law recently but certain things
like<00:04:40.280> that<00:04:40.490> are<00:04:41.000> very<00:04:41.629> non-standard<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.800> I

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
like that are very non-standard and I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.830 
like that are very non-standard and I
would<00:04:43.009> suggest<00:04:43.159> not<00:04:43.400> doing<00:04:43.819> it<00:04:43.879> so<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.360> push

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
would suggest not doing it so you push

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.260 
would suggest not doing it so you push
out<00:04:45.050> with<00:04:45.379> combat<00:04:45.860> concussive<00:04:46.639> shells<00:04:47.000> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
out with combat concussive shells and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.290 
out with combat concussive shells and
get<00:04:47.479> those<00:04:47.569> two<00:04:47.750> confused<00:04:47.780> concussive<00:04:48.710> shells

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
get those two confused concussive shells

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.670 
get those two confused concussive shells
one<00:04:50.300> or<00:04:50.599> two<00:04:50.750> Marauders<00:04:51.169> depending<00:04:51.590> on

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
one or two Marauders depending on

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.020 
one or two Marauders depending on
whether<00:04:51.860> your<00:04:52.069> opponent<00:04:52.460> has<00:04:52.490> their<00:04:52.849> base

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
whether your opponent has their base

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.240 
whether your opponent has their base
down<00:04:53.270> really<00:04:53.720> early<00:04:53.750> like<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.229> nexus<00:04:54.710> first<00:04:54.949> or

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
down really early like a nexus first or

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.490 
down really early like a nexus first or
if<00:04:55.669> they're<00:04:56.150> going<00:04:56.360> for<00:04:56.569> a<00:04:56.599> one-game<00:04:56.930> fe<00:04:57.229> which

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
if they're going for a one-game fe which

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.170 
if they're going for a one-game fe which
is<00:04:57.830> kind<00:04:58.099> of<00:04:58.129> what<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.310> pretended<00:04:58.729> he<00:04:58.819> was<00:04:58.940> doing
