00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
try and force out the whole amount to do

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.910 
try and force out the whole amount to do
my<00:01:35.840> ruffles<00:01:36.200> because<00:01:36.380> I'm<00:01:36.440> trying<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.740> force

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
my ruffles because I'm trying to force

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.140 
my ruffles because I'm trying to force
out<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:37.250> amount<00:01:37.580> I'm<00:01:37.700> not<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.030> get<00:01:38.120> a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
out this amount I'm not going to get a

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.270 
out this amount I'm not going to get a
lot<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.330> control<00:01:38.690> from<00:01:39.050> it<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.770> just<00:01:39.950> take<00:01:40.220> a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
lot of control from it so I just take a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.510 
lot of control from it so I just take a
small<00:01:40.490> amount<00:01:40.910> give<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.870> twist<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:43.340> see

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
small amount give it a twist and see

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.650 
small amount give it a twist and see
it's<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:43.730> about<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.030> come<00:01:44.180> out<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.420> I'm<00:01:44.480> ready

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.770 
and I'm just gonna squeeze the ruffles
backwards<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.860> forwards<00:01:55.420> drawing<00:01:56.420> up<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
backwards and forwards drawing up the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.150 
backwards and forwards drawing up the
side<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.170> cake<00:01:57.380> in<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.710> backwards<00:01:58.070> and

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
side of the cake in a backwards and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.340 
side of the cake in a backwards and
forwards<00:01:58.430> motion<00:01:58.850> just<00:01:59.780> coming<00:02:00.050> to<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.170> top

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
forwards motion just coming to the top

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.440 
forwards motion just coming to the top
edge<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.220> then<00:02:01.370> just<00:02:01.550> go<00:02:01.640> along<00:02:01.850> next<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.360> it

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
edge and then just go along next to it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.020 
edge and then just go along next to it
backwards

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
backwards

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.730 
backwards
so<00:02:04.479> you're<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.630> literally<00:02:05.110> wiggling<00:02:05.619> it

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
so you're just literally wiggling it

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.639 
so you're just literally wiggling it
backwards<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.190> forwards<00:02:06.960> whilst<00:02:07.960> roaring

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
backwards and forwards whilst roaring

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.620 
backwards and forwards whilst roaring
upwards<00:02:09.220> he<00:02:09.759> doesn't<00:02:10.030> need<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.240> be<00:02:10.360> really

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
upwards he doesn't need to be really

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.940 
upwards he doesn't need to be really
neat<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:10.929> when<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.260> all<00:02:11.440> together<00:02:11.620> as<00:02:11.920> a
