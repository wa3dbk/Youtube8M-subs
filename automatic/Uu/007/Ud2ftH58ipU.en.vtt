00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889
 the arthur coach fifteenth internationally the first in italy 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.700
 time the team together 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.289
 to address the shortage 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.439
 who only had a difficult opponent of the three is top 10 on the road 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.069
 but i'm one of nineteen i think they've done their best reading 

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:20.169
 have a few already on until that time applies to the do we have in the back 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.819
 had the four op on cases myself 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.419
 you missed a bit and then a difficult period runs three 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.519
 minutes by the pressure of those two years have to wait before this with the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.499
 pressing and then come back to the game in Russian and we have 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.620
 not there time after time he claims newspaper helped in the bag quarter 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.390
 becoming the sublime is the weather and the score so these are just positive things 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.790
 also bad points that is the most important now we know play about 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.250
 it must work 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.720
 by the point at which that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.140
 an invoice 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.950
 nice and memories infotiv yes but losing the ball midfield yes that is maybe 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.000
 a dancer that is no coincidence that may be a lack of experience 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.220
 so call it lacking experience 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.290
 done for centuries by scoring a nice goal on six of the phase 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.180
 We get the credo against our goalkeeper ticked Hong Kong has played an attempt 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.160
 prepared 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.780
 but in general and with that the performance of the games in the beginning 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 they are not minus 15 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.800
 and i think that italy is playing along with an adult soccer they should 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.220
 even more maturity and less on quakecon with competition 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.830
 okay the second half were variable 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.040
 nature 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.150
 to see a change indeed after ten hours dallas or merit less 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.880
 game still on play why also are not injured in a game 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.280
 play with that pace that that speed and so shall we 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.460
 win change 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.610
 and that we get more fish out that it goes wrong 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.330
 and from before I have definitely replaced something and the book immediately cards already 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.710
 money and that you say we did not have the potential for which I really have 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.500
 six attackers so we are crazy now look at the bullshit must experience 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.100
 to get 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.320
 we also need 3 more efficiency for doing 2 that is really tasty 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.880
 points for every national team in Belgium 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.500
 then we absolutely must consult and engage 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.100
 tuesday craig ward yes of course everyone is allowed to jasper because we work very well 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.709
 broad so I have a broad knowledge in you with ten and twenty players 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.599
 So 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.370
 the next game is another game, the game knew one 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.709
 dramatically and use the images and main roads and we work 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.049
 start the bank started the match
