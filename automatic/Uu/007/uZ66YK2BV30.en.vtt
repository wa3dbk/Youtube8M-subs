00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.760 

first<00:00:15.830> thing<00:00:16.070> we<00:00:16.190> do<00:00:16.400> is<00:00:16.550> we<00:00:16.730> remove<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.420> tire

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
first thing we do is we remove the tire

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.390 
first thing we do is we remove the tire
and<00:00:18.770> then<00:00:19.760> we<00:00:19.910> take<00:00:20.360> a<00:00:20.420> look<00:00:20.750> at<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.710> brake

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
and then we take a look at the brake

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
and then we take a look at the brake
rotor<00:00:22.700> and<00:00:23.439> it's<00:00:24.439> hard<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:24.860> tell<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.490> good<00:00:26.000> brake

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
rotor and it's hard to tell a good brake

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.060 
rotor and it's hard to tell a good brake
rotor<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:26.779> just<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:27.500> not<00:00:27.710> something<00:00:28.040> that

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
rotor you just it's not something that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.030 
rotor you just it's not something that
you<00:00:28.279> can<00:00:28.430> visually<00:00:28.880> see<00:00:29.200> you<00:00:30.200> compare<00:00:30.680> it<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:31.009> a

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
you can visually see you compare it to a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.000 
you can visually see you compare it to a
bad<00:00:31.849> brake<00:00:32.570> rotor<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.290> can<00:00:33.410> see<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:33.860> one

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
bad brake rotor and you can see the one

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.700 
bad brake rotor and you can see the one
on<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.280> right<00:00:34.489> is<00:00:34.940> all<00:00:35.300> tore<00:00:35.809> up<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.200> that's

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
on the right is all tore up and that's

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.639 
on the right is all tore up and that's
because<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.820> shoe<00:00:38.059> itself<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
because the the shoe itself the the

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.799 
because the the shoe itself the the
brake<00:00:40.220> pad<00:00:40.520> itself<00:00:40.910> went<00:00:41.180> straight<00:00:41.510> through

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
brake pad itself went straight through

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.100 
brake pad itself went straight through
to<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.860> tore<00:00:43.489> up<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:43.730> metal<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:44.840> that's

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
to the and tore up that metal so that's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.700 
to the and tore up that metal so that's
the<00:00:45.230> only<00:00:45.320> way<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:45.649> can<00:00:45.860> tell<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:46.600> now

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
the only way you can tell on that now

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.240 
the only way you can tell on that now
this<00:00:48.710> is<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.070> caliper<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:50.769> this<00:00:51.769> has<00:00:52.010> these

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is the caliper and this has these

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.079 
this is the caliper and this has these
two<00:00:52.489> bolts<00:00:52.879> have<00:00:53.089> to<00:00:53.239> come<00:00:53.420> off<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.879> I'm<00:00:55.999> gonna

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
two bolts have to come off and I'm gonna

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.700 
two bolts have to come off and I'm gonna
show<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:56.600> from<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.899> couple<00:00:57.379> different

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
show it to you from a couple different

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.979 
show it to you from a couple different
angles<00:00:57.859> here<00:00:58.339> so<00:00:59.089> you<00:00:59.210> get<00:00:59.329> a<00:00:59.390> real<00:00:59.629> good<00:00:59.809> idea

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
angles here so you get a real good idea

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.349 
angles here so you get a real good idea
of<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:00.499> what<00:01:00.829> we're<00:01:00.980> doing<00:01:01.309> here's<00:01:02.210> another

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
of what what we're doing here's another

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.740 
of what what we're doing here's another
angle<00:01:02.600> go<00:01:03.260> ahead<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.649> pull<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.480> caliper<00:01:05.480> off

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
angle go ahead and pull that caliper off

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.980 
angle go ahead and pull that caliper off
and<00:01:06.230> place<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.220> top<00:01:07.490> place<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.600> upside<00:01:08.750> down

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
and place it on top place it upside down

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.280 
and place it on top place it upside down
be<00:01:09.530> very<00:01:09.770> careful<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.520> brake<00:01:10.970> line

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
be very careful of that brake line

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.080 
be very careful of that brake line
that's<00:01:12.290> full<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.680> brake<00:01:13.070> fluid<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.940> could

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
that's full of brake fluid and it could

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.010 
that's full of brake fluid and it could
affect<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.570> later<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:16.360> next<00:01:17.360> thing<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
affect you later on next thing is the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.950 
affect you later on next thing is the
brake<00:01:18.260> shoes<00:01:18.590> they're<00:01:19.220> gonna<00:01:19.340> pull<00:01:19.700> out<00:01:19.960> and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
brake shoes they're gonna pull out and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.660 
brake shoes they're gonna pull out and
I'll<00:01:21.140> show<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.500> couple<00:01:21.830> different<00:01:22.100> angles

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
I'll show you a couple different angles

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.200 
I'll show you a couple different angles
here<00:01:22.850> they<00:01:23.060> have<00:01:23.270> front<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.750> back<00:01:24.050> side<00:01:24.380> both

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
here they have front and back side both

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.640 
here they have front and back side both
they<00:01:26.210> come<00:01:26.660> popping<00:01:27.080> out<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.350> there

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
they come popping out of there

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.980 
they come popping out of there
they<00:01:28.310> have<00:01:28.490> spring<00:01:28.790> clips<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.300> top<00:01:29.480> and

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
they have spring clips at the top and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.290 
they have spring clips at the top and
they<00:01:30.710> go<00:01:30.860> ahead<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.220> come<00:01:31.340> out<00:01:31.490> there<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.060> see

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
they go ahead and come out there you see

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.520 
they go ahead and come out there you see
on<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.630> backside

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.320 

now<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.160> next<00:01:39.520> thing<00:01:39.640> that's<00:01:39.820> gonna<00:01:40.000> come<00:01:40.300> off

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
now the next thing that's gonna come off

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.530 
now the next thing that's gonna come off
is<00:01:40.750> what's<00:01:40.990> called<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> caliper<00:01:41.890> bridge<00:01:42.100> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
is what's called the caliper bridge and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.970 
is what's called the caliper bridge and
again<00:01:43.540> there's<00:01:43.810> two<00:01:43.870> bolts<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:44.800> to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
again there's two bolts that have to

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.830 
again there's two bolts that have to
come<00:01:45.190> off<00:01:45.370> on<00:01:45.610> there<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:45.880> we're<00:01:46.030> gonna<00:01:46.120> run

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
come off on there and we're gonna run

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.260 
come off on there and we're gonna run
through<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.260> thing<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.620> couple<00:01:47.800> times<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
through this thing a couple times to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:02:00.590 
through this thing a couple times to
make<00:01:49.420> sure<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.960> understand<00:01:50.500> that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.109 

top<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.470> bottom<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.729> make<00:02:02.970> sure

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
top and bottom there you go make sure

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.440 
top and bottom there you go make sure
you<00:02:03.210> put<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> bolts<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.330> bucket<00:02:06.330> or

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you put the bolts in like a bucket or

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.760 
you put the bolts in like a bucket or
something<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:06.960> lose<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.320> here's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
something so you don't lose them here's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.949 
something so you don't lose them here's
an<00:02:07.950> interesting<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.239> rotor<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.750> gonna

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
an interesting thing that rotor is gonna

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.110 
an interesting thing that rotor is gonna
be<00:02:10.200> rust<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.250> everything<00:02:11.520> else<00:02:11.640> will<00:02:11.850> kind<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
be rust and everything else will kind of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.330 
be rust and everything else will kind of
hold<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.470> grab<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> hammer<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
hold it on so you can grab a hammer and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.729 
hold it on so you can grab a hammer and
give<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.819> good<00:02:15.000> hit<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.260> it'll<00:02:16.500> come

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
give it a good hit like that it'll come

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.920 
give it a good hit like that it'll come
off
