00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.190 
people ask me how I got into cosmetic
surgery<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.179> it<00:00:03.449> certainly<00:00:03.840> wasn't

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
surgery and it certainly wasn't

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.900 
surgery and it certainly wasn't
something<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:04.980> high<00:00:05.279> school<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.850> you

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
something that in high school that you

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.880 
something that in high school that you
think<00:00:06.210> oh<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.810> want<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.170> cosmetic<00:00:07.379> surgery

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.680 
think oh I want to do cosmetic surgery
but<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.099> did<00:00:08.400> like<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.700> idea<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.269> surgery

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
but I did like the idea of surgery

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.330 
but I did like the idea of surgery
because<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.110> could<00:00:10.260> work<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.740> your<00:00:10.920> hands

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
because you could work with your hands

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.890 
because you could work with your hands
and<00:00:11.519> I'd<00:00:11.790> always<00:00:12.000> love<00:00:12.300> working<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.690> my

and I'd always love working with my
hands<00:00:13.170> didn't<00:00:13.769> would<00:00:13.950> work<00:00:14.160> eating<00:00:14.519> different

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
hands didn't would work eating different

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.250 
hands didn't would work eating different
things<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.420> went<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> Oklahoma<00:00:15.929> State

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
things I went to Oklahoma State

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.130

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
University and watched an oral and
maxillofacial<00:00:19.500> surgeon<00:00:20.340> work<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.240> was

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
maxillofacial surgeon work and it was

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.720

surgery or other procedures that are
much<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:26.909> involved<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> try<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> spend<00:01:28.409> as

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
much more involved I try to spend as

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
much more involved I try to spend as
much<00:01:28.710> time<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.040> necessary<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
much time as necessary to really get to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.340 
much time as necessary to really get to
know<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.659> patients

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
know my patients

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.340 
know my patients
I<00:01:31.470> enjoy<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.909> love<00:01:33.450> meeting<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
I enjoy it I love meeting them and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
I enjoy it I love meeting them and
finding<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.829> things<00:01:35.030> personally<00:01:36.030> about<00:01:36.299> them

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
finding out things personally about them

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350 
finding out things personally about them
and<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.009> think<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.340> helps<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> recovery

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and I think it helps the recovery

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
and I think it helps the recovery
because<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.079> least<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> mutual

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
because then at least we have a mutual
