around that corner and keep moving we

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.960 
around that corner and keep moving we
liked<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.190> fact<00:01:39.370> that<00:01:39.460> we<00:01:39.580> didn't<00:01:39.730> have<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.880> be

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
liked the fact that we didn't have to be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
self-propelled the heads out front you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.310 
self-propelled the heads out front you
never<00:01:45.610> have<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.940> drive<00:01:46.150> over<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.450> hay<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.840> it
