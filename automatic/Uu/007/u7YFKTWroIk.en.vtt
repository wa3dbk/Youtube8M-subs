now I am kind of bending the Flatiron at
my<00:00:52.890> root<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:54.770> just<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.950> it's<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.700> flat<00:00:57.260> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
my root out just so it's not so flat to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
my root out just so it's not so flat to
my<00:00:58.410> head

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.620 

and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.079> crown<00:01:13.500> area<00:01:17.299> I'm<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and then in my crown area I'm going to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:54.480 
and then in my crown area I'm going to
Flatiron<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> straight<00:01:20.720> out<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.590> root

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.320 

I'm<00:01:55.490> flat<00:01:55.850> ironing<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.930> my<00:01:57.920> part<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.030> have

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
I'm flat ironing to my part now I have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.320 
I'm flat ironing to my part now I have
more<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.870> dramatic<00:02:00.410> part<00:02:02.200> but<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.230> also<00:02:03.470> dried

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
more of a dramatic part but I also dried

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.750 
more of a dramatic part but I also dried
my<00:02:05.330> hair<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.960> my<00:02:06.140> part<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.070> it's<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.310> little<00:02:07.610> bit

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
my hair to my part so it's a little bit

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.040 
my hair to my part so it's a little bit
easier<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:09.520> Flatiron<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.910> get<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.900> lay

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
easier to Flatiron and get it to lay

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:25.390 
easier to Flatiron and get it to lay
down<00:02:12.080> smooth<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.459> next<00:02:23.140> I'm<00:02:24.140> going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.380> use<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
down smooth so next I'm going to use the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.000 
down smooth so next I'm going to use the
dust<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:29.320> it's<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.440> matte

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
dust it and what that is is it's a matte

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.870 
dust it and what that is is it's a matte
texture<00:02:31.790> powder<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.840> it's<00:02:32.989> gonna<00:02:33.170> give<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
texture powder so it's gonna give you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.160 
texture powder so it's gonna give you
that<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:35.090> 2nd<00:02:35.840> day<00:02:36.770> feel<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:38.480> lots<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.930> hold

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that like 2nd day feel with lots of hold

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.070 
that like 2nd day feel with lots of hold
so<00:02:40.100> I'm<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.430> taking<00:02:40.610> sections<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.900> did

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
so I'm just taking sections like I did

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.180 
so I'm just taking sections like I did
when<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.260> flat<00:02:42.590> ironed<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:44.270> kind<00:02:44.570> of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
when I flat ironed and just kind of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.040 
when I flat ironed and just kind of
shaken<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.520> little<00:02:47.030> bit<00:02:47.180> out<00:02:47.330> at<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> time

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.030 

all<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.320> way<00:02:51.440> back<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.959> back<00:02:54.200> area<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.860> my

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
all the way back to the back area of my

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.610 
all the way back to the back area of my
crown<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:57.640> then<00:02:58.640> also<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.660> throughout<00:03:00.350> my

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
crown and then also in throughout my

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:16.400 
crown and then also in throughout my
bangs

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.740 

and<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.070> next<00:03:17.610> I'm<00:03:17.760> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> take<00:03:18.270> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and the next I'm going to take the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.040 
and the next I'm going to take the
transforming<00:03:19.560> pace<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.700> probably<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
transforming pace and probably just a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.180 
transforming pace and probably just a
pea-sized<00:03:22.770> amount<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:24.390> my<00:03:24.750> hand<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.380> emulsify

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
pea-sized amount in my hand and emulsify

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250 
pea-sized amount in my hand and emulsify
it<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.610> what<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.420> isn't<00:03:27.600> going<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.870> do<00:03:28.050> is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it and what this isn't going to do is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.730 
it and what this isn't going to do is
it's<00:03:28.410> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.680> allow<00:03:29.070> me<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:30.170> define<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
it's going to allow me to define the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:41.660 
it's going to allow me to define the
sections<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.170> want<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.560> be<00:03:34.680> dramatic<00:03:40.670> this

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
sections that I want to be dramatic this

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.600 
sections that I want to be dramatic this
is<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.880> lot<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.450> hold<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> little<00:03:44.430> bit

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
is a lot of hold so really a little bit

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.490 
is a lot of hold so really a little bit
of<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:45.140> tends<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.500> go<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:47.240> long<00:03:48.240> way<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:51.500> then

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
of this tends to go a long way and then

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.380 
of this tends to go a long way and then
I'll<00:03:52.650> also<00:03:52.680> do<00:03:53.160> some<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:53.730> back<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.300> my<00:03:54.450> name

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
I'll also do some of it back in my name

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.540 
I'll also do some of it back in my name
just<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.870> isn't<00:03:58.140> flat<00:03:58.800> either

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.460 

and<00:04:05.550> then<00:04:05.970> I'm<00:04:06.450> going<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.690> take<00:04:06.990> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and then I'm going to take the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.500 
and then I'm going to take the
masterpiece<00:04:08.010> again<00:04:08.340> now<00:04:09.300> this<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:12.060> can<00:04:12.270> use

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
masterpiece again now this you can use

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.970
