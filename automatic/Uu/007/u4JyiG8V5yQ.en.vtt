just referencing off of the best
horizontal<00:03:30.750> points<00:03:32.300> now<00:03:33.300> we're<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.660> to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
horizontal points now we're going to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.620 
horizontal points now we're going to

clearly<00:03:41.700> see<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.480> building<00:03:42.750> looks<00:03:43.200> like

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
clearly see that the building looks like

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.470 
clearly see that the building looks like
