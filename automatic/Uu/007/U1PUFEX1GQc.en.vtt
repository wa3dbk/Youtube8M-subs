00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 very good to everyone today I bring you a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.270
 video tutorial on how to change your 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.690
 hard drive in your playstation 4 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490
 it's very easy everything you have thought or 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.460
 think that the hard drive is behind 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.240
 the console for here from behind but not 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.100
 the hard drive is not this idea is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 just here is the hard drive 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 how can we remove this chair piece is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 very easy also does not require any 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 screw of this piece not but 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.449
 we will require a screwdriver 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 to then remove a screw that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 we have here is worth everything 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.290
 we move so the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.969
 first time then let's make a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.379
 small cut and with both hands what 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 I have displace worth because it is me 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.520
 impossible with a good hand because 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.160
 is removed without both hands has 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 It has been impossible and you too will 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 it will happen the same then we have slipped and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.760
 it is already separate voucher without any 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.800
 screw there is nothing in between 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 then we pull a little bit already 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.570
 rather softer and good is that what 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.130
 we have here so here we have our 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.380
 hard drive is worth 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.280
 to be able to change it by default 31 of 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.680
 500 gigabytes but the system is no longer 22 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.230
 so we do not have 408 gigabytes left 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.950
 free without doing anything are worth doing 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.540
 nothing and the console we have 400 8 if you 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.080
 It seems little because you want to be 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.270
 many things and you want to pass it to a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 terabyte or two terabytes since what 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.790
 you pass then in a terabyte has not happened 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.710
 or not 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.560
 so that there is more difference to go out to the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.600
 sata 2 connection and the type of hard disk 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.550
 you want this is screw that we have 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.690
 what to remove and well we go there with a 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.690
 star screwdriver 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.869
 we have it removed 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.869
 it's almost a little 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.710
 Yes now 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.240
 is already removed as you can see very 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.260
 simple and now we pull from here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.910
 strong 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.170
 and the hard drive comes out you can see here the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.490
 size that has this is a housing 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.100
 when I buy on hard disk this does not 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.220
 comes if any of you do not know this one 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.020
 housing that stops 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 put hard drive that we buy 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.040
 we have to unscrew we do not have 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.460
 here with screws another screw 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.960
 stars and on the other side the same or 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.610
 one screw and another and also and once 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.680
 I have these four had the hard circus 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.170
 these who sells you here and leaves what 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.989
 we have already installed 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.020
 over these we tighten a screw and it's 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.340
 very easy is in a matter of two minutes 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.920
 others as many already have 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.440
 installed your new hard drive and 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.210
 well, it will play 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.320
 install everything that I ask of you 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.750
 console that are many gigs will carry 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.200
 enough time and good and to the casing 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.290
 because the same thing is already placed if it does or 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.230
 you do not need two hands and we press here 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.970
 and it's all been seen how easy it is 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.290
 Well, see you next video
