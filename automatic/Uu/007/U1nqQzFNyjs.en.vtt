as he said a free a Cyrus and Raider are
however<00:00:46.270> I<00:00:46.570> do<00:00:47.170> not<00:00:47.649> think<00:00:47.949> that<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:48.250> case

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640

Cyrus I don't think I'll be playing as
ISA<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:56.199> because<00:00:56.440> one<00:00:57.250> we<00:00:57.429> don't<00:00:57.550> know<00:00:57.640> if

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
ISA just because one we don't know if

obviously she could but I don't think

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.050 
obviously she could but I don't think
it's<00:01:14.050> gonna<00:01:14.140> happen<00:01:14.350> I'm<00:01:14.560> not<00:01:14.650> sure<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:15.400> think

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
it's gonna happen I'm not sure I think

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.250 
it's gonna happen I'm not sure I think
she'll<00:01:16.330> be<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> part<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.840> story<00:01:17.080> in<00:01:17.170> the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
she'll be a part of the story in the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.080 
she'll be a part of the story in the
third<00:01:17.410> game<00:01:17.560> just<00:01:17.830> not<00:01:17.980> in<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.340> aspect

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
third game just not in that aspect

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.480 
third game just not in that aspect
alright<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.290> I<00:01:20.680> think<00:01:20.830> we'll<00:01:21.070> be<00:01:21.100> playing<00:01:21.340> as

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
that's the question I think that with a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.140 
that's the question I think that with a
common<00:01:41.950> enemy<00:01:42.070> other<00:01:42.520> worker<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.850> Secrets

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
they'll be able to work together but I'm

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.510 
they'll be able to work together but I'm
just<00:01:45.340> not<00:01:45.490> sure<00:01:45.550> we'll<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.180> see<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:48.100> a

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
just not sure we'll have to see now a

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.220 
just not sure we'll have to see now a
lot<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:48.820> people<00:01:48.940> think<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.450> raid<00:01:49.690> gr<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.170> the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
lot of people think that raid gr and the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.680 
lot of people think that raid gr and the
worker<00:01:50.410> error<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.950> are<00:01:51.190> working<00:01:51.970> together<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
worker error in are working together and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.270 
worker error in are working together and
that's<00:01:53.080> definitely<00:01:53.260> very<00:01:53.650> possible<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.130> if

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
that's definitely very possible and if

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's definitely very possible and if
they<00:01:54.400> are<00:01:54.550> then<00:01:55.360> obviously<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.990> rater<00:01:56.230> are

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
they are then obviously the rater are

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.680 
they are then obviously the rater are
wouldn't<00:01:56.770> be<00:01:56.860> helping<00:01:57.130> Cyrus<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:58.480> think

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
wouldn't be helping Cyrus but I think

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.400 
wouldn't be helping Cyrus but I think
you<00:01:58.780> will<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:58.960> don't<00:01:59.080> think<00:01:59.290> they're<00:01:59.380> working

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
you will I don't think they're working

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.370 
you will I don't think they're working
together<00:01:59.710> I'm<00:02:00.070> just<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.670> doesn't<00:02:00.790> really<00:02:01.000> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
together I'm just that doesn't really I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.030 
together I'm just that doesn't really I
don't<00:02:02.380> know<00:02:02.530> they<00:02:02.620> just<00:02:02.650> doesn't<00:02:02.920> really

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
don't know they just doesn't really

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.080 
don't know they just doesn't really
click<00:02:03.220> with<00:02:03.310> me<00:02:03.550> I'm<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.790> know<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.970> there's

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
click with me I'm you know and there's

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.640 
click with me I'm you know and there's
evidence<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.810> like<00:02:04.990> their<00:02:05.170> armors<00:02:05.470> look

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
evidence of it like their armors look

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.960 
evidence of it like their armors look
very<00:02:05.830> similar<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.190> he<00:02:06.370> does<00:02:06.520> go<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.700> see<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
very similar and he does go to see the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.729 
very similar and he does go to see the
worker<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.450> think<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.289> was<00:02:08.410> for<00:02:08.560> something

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
worker I think that was for something

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.030 
worker I think that was for something
else<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.280> not<00:02:09.399> for<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:10.359> team<00:02:10.599> up

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
else and not for this this team up

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190 
else and not for this this team up
so<00:02:12.489> yeah<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:13.330> right<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.629> after<00:02:13.780> they<00:02:13.989> get<00:02:14.080> out

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so yeah all right so after they get out

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.539 
so yeah all right so after they get out
of<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.349> vault<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.799> think<00:02:15.129> they're<00:02:15.280> gonna<00:02:15.370> be

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
of the vault I think they're gonna be

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.160 
of the vault I think they're gonna be
going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.000> hunt<00:02:16.209> down<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> worker<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.989> mean

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
going to hunt down the worker I mean

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.869 
going to hunt down the worker I mean
obviously<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:18.220> gonna<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.730> main

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
obviously that's gonna be like the main

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.490 
obviously that's gonna be like the main
conflict<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> game<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.900> mean<00:02:20.079> I'm<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
conflict of the game I mean I'm the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.319 
conflict of the game I mean I'm the
surprise<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.159> it's<00:02:21.280> anything<00:02:21.459> else

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
surprise if it's anything else

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.270 
surprise if it's anything else
I<00:02:22.360> think<00:02:23.110> people<00:02:23.319> be<00:02:23.409> disappointed<00:02:23.950> if<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.159> is

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
I think people be disappointed if it is

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.649 
I think people be disappointed if it is
something<00:02:24.579> else<00:02:24.760> but<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.269> think<00:02:25.480> they're<00:02:25.569> going

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
something else but I think they're going

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.319 
something else but I think they're going
to<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.810> going<00:02:25.900> down<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.470> worker<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.329> as

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
to be going down the worker and as

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.990 
to be going down the worker and as
Raider<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.470> Cyrus<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.099> Issa<00:02:30.430> probably<00:02:30.849> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
Raider and Cyrus and Issa probably and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.130 
Raider and Cyrus and Issa probably and
tell<00:02:31.269> would<00:02:31.450> probably<00:02:31.750> fit<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:31.959> there

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
tell would probably fit in there

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.699 
tell would probably fit in there
somewhere

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
somewhere

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.339 
somewhere
I'm<00:02:33.519> just<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.879> sure<00:02:33.909> but<00:02:34.750> we'd<00:02:34.870> be<00:02:35.019> going<00:02:35.110> down

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
I'm just not sure but we'd be going down

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.099 
I'm just not sure but we'd be going down
to<00:02:35.470> hunt<00:02:35.620> down<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.860> worker<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
to hunt down the worker and I think it

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.470 
to hunt down the worker and I think it
would<00:02:38.170> be<00:02:38.260> really<00:02:38.500> cool<00:02:38.819> if<00:02:39.819> we<00:02:39.909> could<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.299> go

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
would be really cool if we could like go

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.149 
would be really cool if we could like go
through<00:02:40.510> multiple<00:02:40.900> castles<00:02:41.739> stuff<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.040> that

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
through multiple castles stuff like that

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.479 
through multiple castles stuff like that
that<00:02:42.189> might<00:02:42.459> make<00:02:42.489> for<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> too<00:02:43.629> big<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.049> game

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that might make for a too big of a game

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.670 
that might make for a too big of a game
but<00:02:45.489> maybe<00:02:45.819> with<00:02:46.090> DLC<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.959> updates<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.470> stuff

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
but maybe with DLC and updates and stuff

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.740 
but maybe with DLC and updates and stuff
we<00:02:48.519> can<00:02:48.670> find<00:02:48.849> different<00:02:48.970> castles<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.659> stuff

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
we can find different castles and stuff

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.800 
we can find different castles and stuff
and<00:02:50.379> be<00:02:50.790> alternating<00:02:51.790> us<00:02:52.090> raise<00:02:52.299> your<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and be alternating us raise your and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.720 
and be alternating us raise your and
Cyrus<00:02:53.349> playing<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.829> both<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.099> them<00:02:54.430> because<00:02:54.639> I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
Cyrus playing as both of them because I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.559 
Cyrus playing as both of them because I
think<00:02:54.909> that<00:02:55.030> would<00:02:55.180> be<00:02:55.209> really<00:02:55.659> awesome<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.290> I

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
think that would be really awesome and I

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.699 
think that would be really awesome and I
think<00:02:58.569> could<00:02:58.959> be<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.290> really<00:02:59.530> really

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
think could be just be really really

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.250 
think could be just be really really
cool<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.069> have<00:03:00.250> different<00:03:01.260> characters

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
cool to have different characters

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.809 
cool to have different characters
blending<00:03:02.560> different<00:03:02.769> characters<00:03:03.040> maybe<00:03:03.700> we

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
blending different characters maybe we

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.280 
blending different characters maybe we
could<00:03:03.970> play<00:03:04.030> ISA<00:03:04.329> for<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.599> little<00:03:04.900> bit<00:03:05.049> although

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
could play ISA for a little bit although

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.390 
could play ISA for a little bit although
I<00:03:05.319> wouldn't<00:03:05.680> really<00:03:05.769> want<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.010> play<00:03:06.129> his<00:03:06.280> her

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
I wouldn't really want to play his her

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.589 
I wouldn't really want to play his her
for<00:03:06.670> as<00:03:06.970> her<00:03:07.659> for<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.200> long<00:03:08.560> time<00:03:08.799> um<00:03:09.040> tell<00:03:09.599> maybe

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
for as her for a long time um tell maybe

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.759 
for as her for a long time um tell maybe
they<00:03:10.750> could<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.019> some<00:03:11.139> kind<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.319> mini<00:03:11.560> game

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
they could have some kind of mini game

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.960 
they could have some kind of mini game
with<00:03:11.950> him<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.220> don't<00:03:12.400> know<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.519> mean<00:03:12.790> he's<00:03:12.879> not

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
with him I don't know I mean he's not

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.069 
with him I don't know I mean he's not
really<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.209> fighter<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.810> couldn't<00:03:13.989> really

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079

really<00:03:37.540> cool<00:03:37.690> like<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.019> workers<00:03:38.290> too

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
really cool like the workers too

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.439 
really cool like the workers too
powerful<00:03:38.799> both<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.160> them<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:40.299> them

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
powerful both of them for them

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.699 
powerful both of them for them
individually<00:03:40.599> but<00:03:41.109> both<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.440> them<00:03:41.530> together

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
individually but both of them together

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.379 
individually but both of them together
could<00:03:42.459> overpower<00:03:42.730> them<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.299> could

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
could overpower them I think that could

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.289 
could overpower them I think that could
be<00:03:43.419> awesome<00:03:44.250> now<00:03:45.250> another<00:03:45.790> thing<00:03:45.879> that<00:03:46.269> people

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
slowly creeping into Cyrus and taking

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.710 
slowly creeping into Cyrus and taking

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
split personalities slight people think

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.220 
split personalities slight people think
that<00:03:54.790> Cyrus<00:03:55.120> or<00:03:55.389> else<00:03:55.629> are<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.870> finally<00:03:56.109> gonna

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
that Cyrus or else are is finally gonna

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.430 
that Cyrus or else are is finally gonna
take<00:03:56.500> over<00:03:56.650> Cyrus<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.659> destroy<00:03:58.659> him<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.079> like

take over Cyrus and destroy him and like

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.159 
take over Cyrus and destroy him and like
and<00:03:59.709> then<00:03:59.919> he'll<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.129> evil<00:04:00.459> again<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.659> I<00:04:01.720> think

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
and then he'll be evil again and I think

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.319 
and then he'll be evil again and I think
that<00:04:02.530> if<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:02.829> happens<00:04:03.220> rager<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.209> the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
that if that happens rager and the

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.599 
that if that happens rager and the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.550 
ISA of town I don't know what they would
do<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.909> that<00:04:19.090> should<00:04:19.479> be<00:04:19.539> awesome<00:04:20.139> I<00:04:20.320> mean

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
do but that should be awesome I mean

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.599 
do but that should be awesome I mean
wouldn't<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.979> mean<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.280> would<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.400> really

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
I think that could be that would be just

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.970 
I think that could be that would be just
make<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> game<00:04:24.930> absolutely<00:04:25.200> perfect<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
make the game absolutely perfect and
