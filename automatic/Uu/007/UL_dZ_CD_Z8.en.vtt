00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.140

 We have a small onion of this size ok 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 We are going to use only a quarter of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.730
 the onion that here I have it aha and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 I want the military please 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.839
 to remove 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.329
 the skin excites the teeth and we are going to 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:54.300
 can use 2 whole teeth 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.300
 garlic there is no problem ok we are going to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.539
 fabiÃ¡n lavalle that in a program today 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.539
 your teeth are returned and travel 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.010
 well, we put this to cook when baking 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.950
 in a cup of water you notice the water 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.200
 onion and garlic then they are more or 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.750
 less so garlic lady look very good 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.450
 see my little hand to be three teeth of 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.229
 garlic as whatever half of your 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.240
 head to head 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.479
 of vido by holes or if you put it to things 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 very good you let it consume half 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.619
 cup up to half a cup half perfect ok 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.750
 then you will have the cooking 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.270
 with this tone very well 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.460
 ok change completely is the oven more 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.130
 cut off from knowledge we do not need 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.000
 nor the onion and garlic to liquefy 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.210
 just like that and we 're going to filter this 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.830
 it's a little cup a measuring tap look 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.330
 how it fits, it reads, always go to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.250
 buy between our two things and with 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.990
 Such beautiful sites that we bought in 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.090
 any side to sarkozy that there is also 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.159
 do it please please ok then what 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.810
 let's do is let's 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.810
 to strain or filter 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 our knowledge this is like a 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.870
 of course very well not you 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.040
 worry another we clean you do not you 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 worry to visit the room that I 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.760
 I usually bring soap shampoo 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.069
 neutral very well propose here I carry 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.980
 clean here so that we do not already have 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.959
 ready but this time I brought them the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.629
 option of a commercial shampoo 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.180
 I little use of anybody in 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.980
 the cheapest the wood the more expensive the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.620
 who want what interests us this 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.019
 has the tecsa pont base which is the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.950
 Japan job that is the basis with what 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.709
 Shampoos are made 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.180
 Petra puts this for example is a shampoo 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.849
 coming 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.739
 with honey but the same can be with 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.930
 anything else against Avila with 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.060
 whatever you want ok we have 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.239
 our little bottle again and then 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.030
 so you see this has another texture 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.519
 but the texture is a little bit more 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 pearled but it does not matter for us what 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.370
 we can enrich by applying the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.109
 knowledge that we do very 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.010
 well with which we did one with rosemary 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:21.560
 exactly with rosemary ok ok then no 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.470
 we can add our which we already have 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.010
 a shampoo of another brand of another quality 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.129
 of another transparent type since they 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.129
 we give 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 quarter cup minister concentrated and 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.380
 before mixing because our friends 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.069
 they are going to ask but I'm going to walk 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.750
 opening garlic blessed day and like me not me 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.489
 I do not do it all day, so it's 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.050
 does it really make fun because I know I'm going 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.310
 walking and I leave a trail of 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.020
 garlic and onion everywhere then 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.540
 Pacos can not tell me that but hey 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.740
 let's add natural citric acid 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.260
 what is lemon lemon 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.530
 it has the same lemon as lemon 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.540
 lemon that helps us lemon and lemon 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.610
 it's rich in vitamins it's going to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.910
 strengthen your hair and it will give you 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.360
 shine to our hair really 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.450
 in fact before they did not use for girls 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.090
 to comb the sheets or tomato or 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.100
 lemon or lemon or water with lemon or water 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.840
 with sugar I also have my mom 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.400
 once I put water with sugar and 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.800
 I had I think all the flies on top of 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.630
 my eyes were around me, well, I would 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.240
 I will see no salad also true 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.580
 lemon tomato but the difference is in 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.380
 that when they combed us like this when 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.270
 we grew up and we wanted to paint our hair 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.120
 that we got the dye not true 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.790
 because the hair was strong and clear 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.890
 how many things we forget is strengthened 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.810
 of doing that they are totally healthy the 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.790
 true totally natural and that's 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.730
 delicious the truth and we forget not 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.830

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.600
