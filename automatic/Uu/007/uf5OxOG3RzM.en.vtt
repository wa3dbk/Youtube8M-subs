00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
also thinking about things we might want

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
also thinking about things we might want
to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.510> differently<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.070> next<00:01:11.340> crop<00:01:14.060> one

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to do differently for the next crop one

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.539 
to do differently for the next crop one
of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> things<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.200> cow<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.040> important

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of the things that a cow is important

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
of the things that a cow is important
for<00:01:17.670> us<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.970> nourish<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.600> agricultural

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
for us to nourish the agricultural

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
for us to nourish the agricultural
economy<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.070> Hawaii<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.210> not

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
economy here in Hawaii because it is not

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.880 
economy here in Hawaii because it is not
clear<00:01:21.689> how<00:01:22.049> we're<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> keep<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.710> this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
clear how we're going to keep all this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.230 
clear how we're going to keep all this
agricultural<00:01:23.520> lands<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
agricultural lands with some of the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.539 
agricultural lands with some of the
pressures<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:25.280> tourism<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.400> for

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
pressures from tourism and for

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.730 
pressures from tourism and for
development<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.600> every<00:01:27.900> crop<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.380> get

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
development and so every crop we can get

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
development and so every crop we can get
and<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.100> diversified<00:01:29.700> local<00:01:30.090> farms<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> help

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and for diversified local farms to help

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
and for diversified local farms to help
sustain<00:01:30.960> those<00:01:31.380> rural<00:01:31.650> communities<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
sustain those rural communities and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
sustain those rural communities and
farming<00:01:33.150> communities<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.960> their<00:01:34.049> economies

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
farming communities and their economies

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.880 
farming communities and their economies
is<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:34.950> critical<00:01:36.470> actually<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
is really critical actually what the in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.070 
is really critical actually what the in
unfermented<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:39.000> tastes<00:01:39.360> like

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
unfermented see tastes like

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.950 
unfermented see tastes like
that<00:01:41.440> guy<00:01:41.620> open<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:43.390> none<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.810> rich

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
that guy open have none of the rich

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.840 
that guy open have none of the rich
chocolaty<00:01:44.620> notes<00:01:44.770> before<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.520> fermentation

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
chocolaty notes before the fermentation

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.630 
chocolaty notes before the fermentation
so<00:01:46.540> we<00:01:47.380> feel<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.830> fermentation<00:01:48.190> adds

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
so we feel like the fermentation adds

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120 
so we feel like the fermentation adds
about<00:01:49.290> three-quarters<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.560> final<00:01:50.920> flavor

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
about three-quarters of the final flavor

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.800 
about three-quarters of the final flavor
of<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.520> chocolate<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.180> farmer<00:01:52.660> is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
of the chocolate and the farmer is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.500 
of the chocolate and the farmer is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.850 
is a neat bar because it's chocolate in
two<00:03:44.940> very<00:03:45.270> different<00:03:45.360> forms<00:03:46.260> than<00:03:46.470> people<00:03:46.770> are

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
two very different forms than people are

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.949 
two very different forms than people are
used<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:48.060> adds<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.690> nice

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
used to and it adds a really nice

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.720 
used to and it adds a really nice
texture<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.650> also<00:03:49.800> makes<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.160> healthier<00:03:50.580> the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
texture it also makes it healthier the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.040 
texture it also makes it healthier the
reason<00:03:51.030> people<00:03:51.360> are<00:03:51.450> always<00:03:51.600> seeing<00:03:51.840> dark

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
reason people are always seeing dark

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.270 
reason people are always seeing dark

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
is because the nibs have no sugar in

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.930 
is because the nibs have no sugar in
them<00:03:55.740> they're<00:03:55.890> they're<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.580> really<00:03:56.820> good
