late video but better late than never I
suppose<00:00:08.599> so<00:00:09.599> yeah<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> actual<00:00:10.139> changes<00:00:10.440> about

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
suppose so yeah the actual changes about

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.410 
suppose so yeah the actual changes about
my<00:00:10.740> head<00:00:10.950> somewhere<00:00:11.190> notepad<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:12.240> they've

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
my head somewhere notepad what they've

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.990 
my head somewhere notepad what they've
done<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:13.190> reduce<00:00:14.190> some<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> damage<00:00:14.700> on

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
done is reduce some of the damage on

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180 
done is reduce some of the damage on
flail<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.540> north<00:00:15.809> wind<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.470> initial<00:00:16.710> hit<00:00:17.010> so

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
flail the north wind the initial hit so

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
flail the north wind the initial hit so
you<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:17.580> she<00:00:17.699> goes<00:00:17.850> like<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:19.340> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
you know when she goes like this and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
you know when she goes like this and
then<00:00:20.720> BAM<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.500> portion<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
then BAM like that that portion of the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160 
then BAM like that that portion of the
damage<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:24.210> been<00:00:24.449> lowered<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> can

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
damage that's been lowered so as you can

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
damage that's been lowered so as you can
see<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.920> gone<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.779> used<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.910> 45.5

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
see it's gone from used to be for 45.5

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.860 
see it's gone from used to be for 45.5
78.5<00:00:30.840> 10%<00:00:31.439> gone<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> four<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.430> 4.5<00:00:32.870> 55.5

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
78.5 10% gone down to four or 4.5 55.5

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.459 
78.5 10% gone down to four or 4.5 55.5
and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.140> six<00:00:34.410> percent<00:00:34.770> percent<00:00:35.130> damage<00:00:36.469> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and then six percent percent damage so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.530 
and then six percent percent damage so
at<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.250> rank<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:38.969> couple<00:00:39.300> ranks

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
at the first rank or first couple ranks

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.780 
at the first rank or first couple ranks
is<00:00:39.629> not<00:00:39.809> huge<00:00:40.079> difference<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.770> later<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is not huge difference then later on it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.400 
is not huge difference then later on it
starts<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> become<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> bigger<00:00:42.600> difference<00:00:42.780> now

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
starts to become a bigger difference now

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.440 
starts to become a bigger difference now
of<00:00:43.530> course<00:00:43.710> percentage<00:00:44.579> p<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.789> proportional

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
of course percentage p is proportional

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.910 
of course percentage p is proportional
thing<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> mean<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.110> scales<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> game

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
thing so I mean is it scales to the game

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
thing so I mean is it scales to the game
it's<00:00:47.190> technically<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> same<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.899> at

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's technically the same thing but at

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.080 
it's technically the same thing but at
the<00:00:49.079> same<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.070> longer<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> game<00:00:50.820> goes

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the same time the longer the game goes

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
the same time the longer the game goes
the<00:00:51.329> less<00:00:51.510> damage<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.440> dealing<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.010> know

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the less damage you are dealing you know

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880 
the less damage you are dealing you know
as<00:00:53.160> people<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.820> HP<00:00:54.890> four

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
as people get more and more HP four

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.860 
as people get more and more HP four
percent<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> biggest<00:00:57.300> hit<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> world

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
percent not the biggest hit in the world

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
percent not the biggest hit in the world
I<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> know<00:00:59.550> going

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I don't know if this is you know going

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.080 
I don't know if this is you know going

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
percent damage on the the flail clingy

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.620 
percent damage on the the flail clingy
part<00:01:13.320> after<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> initial<00:01:14.250> hit<00:01:14.630> I'm

you can't even see me do that anyway
yeah<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.759> secondary<00:01:21.240> portion<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.320> damage

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
yeah the secondary portion of the damage

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.950 
yeah the secondary portion of the damage
that's<00:01:22.799> still<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:24.900> know

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that's still the same so I don't know

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.550 
that's still the same so I don't know
it's<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.729> nerve<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:28.049> kind<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it's not much of a nerve it's kind of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's not much of a nerve it's kind of
interesting<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.310> said<00:01:29.549> Johnny<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you know the whole quote go tank matter

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.690 
you know the whole quote go tank matter
what<00:01:34.079> everything's<00:01:34.380> started<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> she<00:01:34.950> fits

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
what everything's started and she fits

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.609 
what everything's started and she fits
into<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.689> top<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.200> she<00:01:37.500> has

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
into that and on top of that she has

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
into that and on top of that she has
percent<00:01:38.040> damage<00:01:38.189> which<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> tank<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
percent damage which is the tank that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.499 
percent damage which is the tank that
