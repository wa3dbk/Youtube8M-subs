00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.150
 It is the audio toward to the team 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.850
 sound to have the only one that I lack 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.240
 It is to connect the microphone microphone 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.170
 wireless connect the wiring of the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.780

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.990
 my microphone we connect there 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.830
 and that's all then what we lack 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.100
 is to turn on the devices without a microphone 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.100

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.760
 I already have my microphone installed and the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.250
 others also 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.799
 with the other cables of the TV set 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.689
 equipment are already installed ready for 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.390

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.780
 we are going to enter what is the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.540
 black screen that is going to go towards the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.909
 television once we connect 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.010
 the preferred topics to see for example 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.209

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.910
 and dragged him here 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.910
 if it's really all right double click and 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.520
 effectively 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.520

 we can place an image that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.799

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.910
 people 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.460
 and so dear friends like this in this way 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.039
 you can have your karaoke at home 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.229
 a spectacular way not only a 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.740
 television as you can see a 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.270
 small computer and your computer or laptop 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.880
 Of course it is phenomenally totally 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.060
 independent what software is with 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.639
 the television can add the images 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.229
 that you teach 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.370
 in this way as you are 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.070
 seeing 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.150
 and of course, excellent at home or for 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.150
 business of course
