f3<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.709> on<00:03:56.250> 28<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.870> will<00:03:58.019> go<00:03:58.410> down<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:59.580> about

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
f3 is on 28 that will go down to about

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.699 
f3 is on 28 that will go down to about
18<00:04:01.670> which<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.820> still<00:04:03.030> pretty<00:04:03.239> good<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:04.560> me

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
18 which is still pretty good for me

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.830 
18 which is still pretty good for me
because<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.700> has<00:04:05.850> been<00:04:06.060> going<00:04:06.299> down<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.660> like

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
because it has been going down to like

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
because it has been going down to like
11<00:04:07.380> recently<00:04:08.480> but<00:04:09.480> still<00:04:10.080> keeps<00:04:10.470> going<00:04:10.680> down

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
11 recently but still keeps going down

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.340 
11 recently but still keeps going down
for<00:04:11.370> some<00:04:11.549> reason<00:04:11.880> because<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.350> absolutely

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
for some reason because it's absolutely

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.289 
for some reason because it's absolutely
shocking<00:04:13.860> even<00:04:14.190> though<00:04:14.310> got<00:04:14.519> focus<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.120> run

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
shocking even though got focus of run

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.900 
shocking even though got focus of run
and<00:04:15.540> I've<00:04:15.750> already<00:04:16.049> checked<00:04:16.380> out<00:04:16.590> alkyd<00:04:17.070> 3

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
and I've already checked out alkyd 3

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.409 
and I've already checked out alkyd 3
goods<00:04:18.290> but<00:04:19.370> you'll<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.000> red<00:04:21.180> thing

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
goods but you'll see that the red thing

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.340 
goods but you'll see that the red thing
is<00:04:21.690> how<00:04:22.470> much<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:23.040> taking<00:04:23.640> Hammerschlag<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
is how much it's taking Hammerschlag the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.080 
is how much it's taking Hammerschlag the
reason<00:04:25.650> it's<00:04:25.800> probably<00:04:26.130> lagging<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:26.669> much<00:04:26.910> is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
reason it's probably lagging so much is

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.170 
reason it's probably lagging so much is
because<00:04:27.419> there<00:04:28.349> are<00:04:28.500> 39<00:04:28.890> people<00:04:29.250> are<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.669> it

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
because there are 39 people are and it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.500 
because there are 39 people are and it
will

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
will

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.210 
will
