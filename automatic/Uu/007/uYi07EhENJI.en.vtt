could be anything like what well the
other<00:00:10.380> day<00:00:10.620> curiosity<00:00:11.400> came<00:00:11.639> by<00:00:12.019> we<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
other day curiosity came by we got to

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.990 
other day curiosity came by we got to
talking<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.950> guy<00:00:14.160> used<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.549> play<00:00:14.790> around

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
talking about a guy used to play around

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.410 
talking about a guy used to play around
with<00:00:15.150> numbers<00:00:15.599> or<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.609> Leonardo<00:00:17.609> da<00:00:18.090> Vinci

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
with numbers or was it Leonardo da Vinci

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.250 
with numbers or was it Leonardo da Vinci
no<00:00:19.289> Leonardo<00:00:20.250> Fibonacci<00:00:20.720> how<00:00:21.720> long<00:00:21.930> ago<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
no Leonardo Fibonacci how long ago is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.000 
no Leonardo Fibonacci how long ago is
that<00:00:22.350> back<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.039> medieval<00:00:23.369> times<00:00:24.680> see<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that back in medieval times see what the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.609 
that back in medieval times see what the
Fibonacci<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.630> pretty<00:00:28.019> simple

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
Fibonacci do is pretty simple

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.880 
Fibonacci do is pretty simple
he<00:00:29.490> started<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.779> adding<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
he started with one and adding one to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
he started with one and adding one to
itself<00:00:32.250> he<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.790> yeah<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> very

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
itself he got two yeah that is very

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.620 
itself he got two yeah that is very
simple<00:00:34.410> huh<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.130> he<00:00:35.820> had<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.149> next<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
simple huh but then he had one next to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.830 
simple huh but then he had one next to
one<00:00:36.840> next<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.559> two<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.129> he<00:00:38.280> said<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> himself

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
one next to two so he said to himself

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
one next to two so he said to himself
I'll<00:00:39.840> take<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> last<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.680> numbers<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
I'll take the last two numbers in the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
I'll take the last two numbers in the
list<00:00:41.460> never<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.480> next<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
list never the one next to the to the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
list never the one next to the to the
one<00:00:43.500> next<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> let<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.730> give<00:00:44.850> him

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
one next to the two and let it give him

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.900 
one next to the two and let it give him
three<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.739> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> three<00:00:47.100> next<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> two

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
three and on the three next to the two

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.350 
three and on the three next to the two
would<00:00:48.270> give<00:00:48.450> him<00:00:48.570> five<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> five<00:00:50.610> next<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
would give him five the five next to the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.630 
would give him five the five next to the
three<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.809> give<00:00:51.930> him<00:00:52.050> eight<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.280> get

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
three would give him eight and get

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.180 
three would give him eight and get
playing<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> numbers<00:00:54.320> 13<00:00:55.320> 21<00:00:55.949> 34<00:00:56.149> 55<00:00:57.149> 89

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
playing with the numbers 13 21 34 55 89

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.170 
playing with the numbers 13 21 34 55 89
sounds<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> waste<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> time

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
sounds like a waste of time

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.229 
sounds like a waste of time
that's<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> thought<00:01:01.670> no<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.910> he<00:01:03.000> didn't

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that's what I thought no that he didn't

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.200 
that's what I thought no that he didn't
have<00:01:03.329> anything<00:01:03.570> better<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> turns

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
have anything better to do but it turns

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
have anything better to do but it turns
out<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> curiosity<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> had<00:01:08.010> him

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
out that the curiosity that had him

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
out that the curiosity that had him
playing<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> adding<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
playing with this kind of adding up of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380 
playing with this kind of adding up of
numbers<00:01:10.580> what's<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.790> remembered<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
numbers what's now remembered as the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.050 
numbers what's now remembered as the
Fibonacci<00:01:12.930> numbers<00:01:13.610> turns<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
Fibonacci numbers turns out to have a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.660 
Fibonacci numbers turns out to have a
curious<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.080> surprising<00:01:16.670> relationship

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
curious and very surprising relationship

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.050 
curious and very surprising relationship
to<00:01:17.939> botany<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.710> classical<00:01:19.710> art<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.430> song<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to botany and classical art how song I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.870 
to botany and classical art how song I
don't<00:01:21.930> lie<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.740> seems<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> examples

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
don't lie but there seems to be examples

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.580 
don't lie but there seems to be examples
of<00:01:24.000> Fibonacci<00:01:24.240> numbers<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.049> over<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.350> place

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

what like the spirals of the tiny

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
what like the spirals of the tiny
florets<00:01:29.460> found<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> core<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> Daisy

on pineapples bear an 8 to 13 ratio

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.770 
on pineapples bear an 8 to 13 ratio
think<00:01:58.710> he<00:01:58.800> knew<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.340> getting<00:01:59.520> into

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
think he knew what he was getting into

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.120 
think he knew what he was getting into
yeah<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.729> sure<00:02:02.729> made<00:02:02.970> me<00:02:03.000> curious

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
yeah I don't know sure made me curious
