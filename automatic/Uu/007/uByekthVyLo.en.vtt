00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.380
 And then I said, everybody, all right, beauty. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.349
 be another video along with foot 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 2015 and I left the gameplay background and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.550
 playing with bayern munich vs 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.109
 juventus is in which five stars to 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.609
 45 I do not know what it will be 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.310
 and I played badly in this game and had a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.199
 player is expelled but is up to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.520
 some bids so unusual show 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.110
 to you how're physics 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559
 dribbling right 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 First John of Oak speak that the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.090
 neighborhood is the best team so far I played 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.760
 is the team that is most complete with 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 Robben and stronger players are 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.280
 very strong is also to know if this 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 and you will now see that it mimics the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.559
 people speak very well in the area and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.629
 enjoying well is rebound and everything 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.239
 You'll see what I do and what you 're doing. 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.789
 exactly where the father locked it and went to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 The ball hit the ball but it is 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.010
 to predict that I'm improving in the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 faults 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 and I'm here as well as the title of the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.850
 video to tell you some news 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.799
 first konami if you lost 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 now explained was made public if 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.380
 explain why Brazilian chile 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.369
 details disclosed as agent 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 many people thought that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.759
 was it a goal of the game or is it some kind of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.530
 version that went wrong is some kind of 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.360
 thing but it's what I more or less 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.450
 I imagined but I was not sure why 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.299
 I told you when you're sure that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.549
 the economy did not have all the rights to 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.530
 all players released because here 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.960
 In Brazil, everyone wants to win. 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.869
 money on top of everyone already 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.750
 know this then the economy has to 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.270
 it already has the right of the teams thing 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.520
 He did not get there because he could not 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.659
 find the person to negotiate with anyone 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 failed to pay 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.619
 she got talked so ah boss 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 this shit and no one got ready and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.430
 ended up consenting to Brazilians talking 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.700
 have been able to find that it is negotiating 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.349
 things and got the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.290
 release of the Brazilians with their 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.750
 uniforms are and with 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.439
 everything that has players right there and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.569
 everything else 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.849
 Only a few times it's not there. 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.209
 complete is the case of several teams there 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.569
 known is so remember so and soon 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.829
 beginning is the athletic Flemish miner and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.079
 São Paulo are teams that are not yet 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.939
 updated and some movies that in the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.650
 before launch was not 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.409
 updated as Basque and I think the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.709
 saints have also updated some 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.299
 things but there are still players who 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.129
 are complicated by the name of the 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.829
 they do not exist but always do 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.720
 an allusion to the name that really is 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.859
 is the case of rogerio always looking 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.609
 rogério com je acute accent is not worse 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.950
 so you see it's a clear face I 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.299
 we took a goal in a clear allusion to the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.389
 rogerio ceni né 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.209
 only in ways not explicit so that 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.370
 there is no reprisal for the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.620
 parties who defend the rights of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.739
 players there in the case of rogério ceni 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.959
 well she said that this is being seen 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.260
 it was not an abandoned thing 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.790
 there was expelled and the bike passing in the u 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.699
 this is one thing they are ignoring 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.549
 are aware of this error and they are 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.629
 running behind is updating until the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.909
 end of year 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.069
 only we're already in at almost the 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.909
 half of November today, day 13 of 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.329
 November 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.250
 then they're probably going to do this 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.470
 See you next month, right? 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.810
 I hope before Christmas and after 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.329
 Christmas nothing else works in the world is 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.109
 so they are aware of this I 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.459
 I would like to give you this clarified 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.229
 because it shows that we are not 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.930
 playing dumb as well as certain 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:02.729
 companies do with a city the age 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.390
 income and activism are doing with the led 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:07.150
 it's dodo 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.470
 w I'll bring a video talking about 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.100
 this for you 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.200
 so they are being so a company 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.090
 reputable walk to come announces 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.980
 that they have this problem but that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.440
 is being resolved and that until the end of 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.710
 year will be all cool there zinho 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.419
 cute no team all right it was 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.030
 asked if they even said they are 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.130
 correct uniform is changed in Basque 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.200
 two months is not correct 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.930
 the uniform that is there is old uniform 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.020
 because I do not honestly understand 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.400
 because they do this kind of thing 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.680
 still have a lot of update for 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.450
 make a point of players is that already 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.669
 They came out a few times already been to the 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.990
 Other I do not understand why they phase is 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.120
 one foot is so late so is leaving so 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.130
 late and even time out before they 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.270
 They are understanding that he left before 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.550
 2015 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.830
 is the tip and almost got a corner kick. 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.050
 he is the foot 2015 but they only in 2014 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.190
 even if they late is a thing 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.260
 impressive 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.180
 I cited the example of Mary who is already 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.840
 I was still in athletic Madrid with 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.910
 athletic even in real madrid and he already 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.710
 had gone a long time, right? 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.140
 here was not in real madrid is the same 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.910
 but unfortunately this is another thing 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.910
 Unfortunately, we're going to have to 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.150
 and I do not know what to swallow 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.290
 that the new generation was not forgotten 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.930
 was ignored 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.650
 she was ignored by her feet as she went 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.169
 in fifa 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.690
 if you play pes on Playstation 4 on 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.520
 xbox the year we will generate dream in general in 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.919
 play in the old generation you seem to 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.050
 is playing another game so 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.300
 I am speaking clearly of the graph of 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.880
 seop graphic engine gameplay 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.950
 will change but the game is different the game 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.370
 it's totally different is not this game 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.190
 Locked is not I do not know for sure explain 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.020
 for you guys make me understand a lot 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.300
 people think I wanted to play the same 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.630
 fish game of 14 answers and no no 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.540
 that's it but it's something they used 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.190
 everything they could use to do it. 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.410
 new generation they paid to see the 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.270
 relationship they got me 14 is a 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.530
 hatchet and as they have already spoken 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.720
 this in the comments 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.790
 and it really is a bit of truth and 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.650
 shit a little and you 'll find if you 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.440
 want quality you like a video game 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.660
 basically what konami did 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.450
 and there it is made is that companies in general 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.430
 they have done it this way we have given 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.610
 money to them anyway they are 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.130
 shitting and walking to our who is 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.020
 finding old generation game is some 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.150
 something that is natural and in a while 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.550
 Let's stop launching games with so much 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.590
 frequency up compare released games 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.270
 to see the generation then you like 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.730
 of games is getting ready together a 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.070
 Bit to buy your videogame 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.610
 new generation because unfortunately 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.590
 This is the future, this is news. 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.480
 konami has agreed to resolve the 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.430
 problem explaining that you are better at 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:06.810
 It's also better that you have 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:10.390
 forgotten is the pomegranate have forgotten the 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.550
 country in the old generation but unfortunately 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.410
 We have to sleep with this and do what? 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.200
 life if you want more explanations 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.970

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.690

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.840
 special attention in the game that appeared 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.040

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.040
