solid seal between the two parts and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.170 
solid seal between the two parts and
then<00:02:06.189> you're<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.399> to<00:02:06.460> shake<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.880> with<00:02:07.030> good

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
then you're going to shake it with good

you're<00:02:15.459> just<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.819> give<00:02:15.970> one<00:02:16.000> strong<00:02:16.840> tap

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
you're just going to give one strong tap

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.220 
you're just going to give one strong tap
on<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.159> side<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.640> mixing<00:02:18.970> glass<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.480> the
