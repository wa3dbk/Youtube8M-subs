somebody with a really really petite
head<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:48.340> does<00:00:48.489> not<00:00:48.640> cover<00:00:48.940> my<00:00:49.660> sideburns

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.860 

and<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.379> guess<00:01:02.680> I'm<00:01:03.370> looking<00:01:03.699> at<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.480> model

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870

here<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.110> didn't<00:01:05.470> realize<00:01:05.770> that<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:06.040> roots

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
here I didn't realize that the roots

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
here I didn't realize that the roots
were<00:01:06.400> gonna<00:01:06.580> be<00:01:06.700> black

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
were gonna be black

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.320 
were gonna be black
I<00:01:07.330> thought<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.730> hair<00:01:09.730> was<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:09.910> already<00:01:15.330> up

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
I thought the hair was just already up

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.780 
I thought the hair was just already up
there<00:01:16.600> was<00:01:17.020> The<00:01:17.140> Cranberries<00:01:17.680> if<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.580> not

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
there was The Cranberries if it is not

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.230 
there was The Cranberries if it is not
it<00:01:19.150> it's<00:01:19.840> got<00:01:20.020> black<00:01:20.200> roots<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:21.520> wouldn't

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
it it's got black roots which wouldn't

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.270 
it it's got black roots which wouldn't
bother<00:01:22.570> me<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:22.930> any<00:01:23.110> other<00:01:23.470> circumstance<00:01:24.070> but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
bother me in any other circumstance but

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.860 
bother me in any other circumstance but
I<00:01:24.370> really<00:01:24.670> thought<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.150> was<00:01:25.270> already<00:01:25.600> I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
I really thought that it was already I

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.240 
I really thought that it was already I
thought<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.380> was<00:01:26.530> just<00:01:26.800> 99<00:01:27.310> jn3<00:01:28.060> yes<00:01:28.510> not<00:01:29.250> but

and I don't know what they were thinking

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
and I don't know what they were thinking
with<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.940> crimped<00:02:13.450> junk<00:02:13.989> that's<00:02:14.349> in<00:02:14.530> here

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
because it's hideous

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.540 
because it's hideous
it<00:02:17.349> doesn't<00:02:17.590> make<00:02:17.680> sense<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.010> me<00:02:18.220> there's<00:02:18.459> a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
it doesn't make sense to me there's a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.589 
it doesn't make sense to me there's a
big<00:02:18.700> piece<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.000> gear

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599
