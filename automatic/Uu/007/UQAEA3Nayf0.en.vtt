00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.610
 Hello today I will teach you how to do 

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.440
 lipstick super easy to do and not on 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.509
 expenses so much for instead of buying you a 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.190
 and christie almost super expensive does not come out in 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.349
 less than a dollar much less less than 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.300
 50 cents is more and what we are going to 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.620
 occupy will be many colors the 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.050
 colors that you want to make your 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.939
 red lip pink purple black or color 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.189
 that you want and apart from that 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.880
 we are also going to occupy pigments of 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.149
 A lot of diamantine coconut oil extract 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.680
 vanilla looks like a new cake and 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.390
 Petroleum jelly and colors come out super nice 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.640
 superfi commented and do not hurt 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.560
 because the colors that you hold are going to 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.850
 say they are not toxic and apart they are 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.170
 as for small children and I do not think 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.400
 because sometimes the children put it on 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.050
 the mouth and these things when I think that 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.030
 harm and apart from that what we are going 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 to occupy will be recipients of 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.550
 lipstick and soft of what you were 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.610
 old people to put the new ones 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.829
 and we are that I made this moradito 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.180
 orange another dark purple and by 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.520
 latest 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.290
 another orange said that we are not going to choose 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.820
 What color are we going to read? 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.530
 grab this flesh color first and what 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.380
 I'm going to cut like that into tiny pieces and 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.180
 I'm going to take it off the little piece of paper 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.040
 around because we do not want it and not 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.630
 are the colors that I will use after 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.900
 to grab a pot and I'm going to throw 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.780
 hot water since it has filled the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.780
 I'm going to put on the stove and I'm going to 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.340
 learn to fire high super high I'll 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.110
 grab another little gem and I'll put it 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.960
 so that I float and I'll grab little 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.540
 Vaseline after vanilla extract 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820
 a cover of horitas and chiquita and for 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.860
 last coconut oil I'm going to stir 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.170
 super super good 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.380
 and then I will incorporate the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.590
 colors and I'm going to grab cherry coffee 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.060
 beige purple and when will it be all 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.100
 melted is ready to put it to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.230
 our little boat we are going to turn it around and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 we start also down and we're going to 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.640
 put all the color all the pigment and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.860
 after 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.930
 if they want to heat what was left for 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.880
 turn it out we put it in the fridge 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.040
 we leave well as little as 3 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.380
 seconds not 3 minutes less less a 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.020
 minute and that is the same procedure 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.970
 for the orange but instead of already 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.400
 leave it like that I'm going to put pigments 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.890
 pink and bright and that's how I 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.570
 the super purple is left in the orange and 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.160
 the dark purple and good many of my 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.450
 goalkeepers have already really liked 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.840
 do it because it is super super easy 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.840
 bye
