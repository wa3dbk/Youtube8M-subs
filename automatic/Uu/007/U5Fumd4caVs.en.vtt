here<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:05.850> go<00:00:06.120> harping<00:00:06.569> on<00:00:06.690> sparkplugs<00:00:07.440> again

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
here I go harping on sparkplugs again

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.250 
here I go harping on sparkplugs again
you're<00:00:08.429> probably<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.300> hear<00:00:09.750> me<00:00:09.929> harp

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you're probably going to hear me harp

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.520 
you're probably going to hear me harp
about<00:00:10.440> them<00:00:10.800> until<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> can't<00:00:11.790> harp<00:00:12.240> any<00:00:12.570> longer

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
about them until I can't harp any longer

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.829 
about them until I can't harp any longer
you<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.160> just<00:00:14.400> shot<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> week<00:00:15.330> ago<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
you know I just shot about a week ago I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.980 
you know I just shot about a week ago I
shot<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.560> engine<00:00:17.430> inspection<00:00:18.060> video<00:00:18.480> series

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
shot a engine inspection video series

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.840 
shot a engine inspection video series
where<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> talked<00:00:19.650> about<00:00:19.830> plugs<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:20.730> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
where I talked about plugs and some of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.259 
where I talked about plugs and some of
the<00:00:20.939> problems<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.199> run<00:00:22.230> into<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the problems you can run into and it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.439 
the problems you can run into and it
happened<00:00:24.660> again<00:00:25.250> just<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.369> few<00:00:26.580> days<00:00:26.760> later<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
happened again just a few days later so

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.169 
happened again just a few days later so
I<00:00:27.750> guess<00:00:28.199> repetition<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.880> good

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I guess repetition really is a good

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.849 
I guess repetition really is a good
teacher<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.840> I'm<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> repeat

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
teacher so I'm just going to repeat

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520 
teacher so I'm just going to repeat
myself<00:00:32.270> remember<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.840> three<00:00:33.960> reasons

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
myself remember there's three reasons

why you want to inspect your spark plugs
you<00:00:37.020> don't<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.649> history<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> car

efore<00:00:56.280> 30<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:56.969> changing<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> plugs

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
efore 30 here we're changing the plugs

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.560 
efore 30 here we're changing the plugs
and<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.699> 16<00:01:00.239> spark<00:01:00.600> plugs<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.579> know

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and it has 16 spark plugs so I I know

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
and it has 16 spark plugs so I I know
the<00:01:03.870> temptation<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> cheap

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
plugs because 16 times you know

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.830 
plugs because 16 times you know
expensive<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.560> expensive<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:12.240> other<00:01:12.390> reason

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is someone who installed the plugs may

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
is someone who installed the plugs may

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
is really good like excessive anti-seize

moments and then finally they they may

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
moments and then finally they they may
not<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.450> torqued<00:01:30.720> properly<00:01:31.200> I've<00:01:32.070> seen<00:01:32.340> plugs

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
not be torqued properly I've seen plugs

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
not be torqued properly I've seen plugs
loose<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.140> over<00:01:34.530> again<00:01:34.619> particularly

you<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.420> plugs<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you see on the plugs here that we just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.490 
you see on the plugs here that we just
removed<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.450> m113<00:01:45.450> engine<00:01:45.750> let<00:01:46.380> me

removed from this m113 engine let me
show<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> found<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.759> these<00:01:47.939> plugs<00:01:48.240> now

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
show you what I found on these plugs now

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.240 
show you what I found on these plugs now
remember<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.500> getting<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.770> check<00:01:50.009> engine

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
remember I was getting a check engine

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.920 
remember I was getting a check engine
light<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.729> showed<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> misfire<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.659> number

one cylinder so maybe we're maybe we're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.870 
one cylinder so maybe we're maybe we're
seeing<00:01:56.939> why<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.689> misfiring<00:01:58.610> whatever<00:01:59.610> was

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

any type of anti-seize I've seen it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
any type of anti-seize I've seen it
looks<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.420> lithium<00:02:07.079> grease<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.829> it's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
looks more like lithium grease but it's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.680 
looks more like lithium grease but it's
just<00:02:08.009> kind<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.340> oozing<00:02:08.759> out<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.360> all

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
just kind of oozing out the back and all

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.430 
just kind of oozing out the back and all
over<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> washer<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
over the washer and this was on all the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.080 
over the washer and this was on all the
excessive<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.710> see<00:02:14.920> some<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
excessive you can see some of the the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.080 
excessive you can see some of the the
fouling<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> tips<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.910> don't<00:02:18.910> know<00:02:19.000> if

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
fouling on the tips I don't know if

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.300 
fouling on the tips I don't know if
those<00:02:19.210> plugs<00:02:19.570> were<00:02:19.750> even<00:02:20.080> firing<00:02:20.470> properly

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
those plugs were even firing properly

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.270 
those plugs were even firing properly
but<00:02:21.430> let's<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:22.140> did<00:02:23.140> find<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.800> them<00:02:24.070> that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
but let's I did find one of them that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.010 
but let's I did find one of them that
was<00:02:24.430> loose<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:24.850> let's<00:02:25.360> talk<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> little<00:02:25.720> bit

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
was loose but let's talk a little bit

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.050 
was loose but let's talk a little bit
more<00:02:26.230> about<00:02:26.470> what<00:02:27.310> we're<00:02:27.460> seeing<00:02:27.490> right<00:02:28.030> here

school<00:02:40.960> is<00:02:41.470> yeah<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.800> don't<00:02:42.190> want<00:02:42.340> them<00:02:42.520> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
school is yeah you don't want them to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.030 
school is yeah you don't want them to
seize<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.150> heads<00:02:43.390> but<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.350> problem<00:02:44.860> with

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
seize in the heads but the problem with

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.250 
seize in the heads but the problem with
these<00:02:45.190> newer<00:02:45.640> computer<00:02:46.240> control<00:02:46.600> cars<00:02:46.960> is

these newer computer control cars is

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.310 
these newer computer control cars is
they<00:02:47.410> have<00:02:47.980> such<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:49.180> know<00:02:49.210> a<00:02:49.330> very<00:02:50.140> high

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
they have such a you know a very high

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.800 
they have such a you know a very high
voltage<00:02:50.680> spark<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:51.520> needs<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.910> super<00:02:52.600> good

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.130 
voltage spark and it needs a super good
ground<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.580> have<00:02:54.820> any<00:02:55.180> intermittent

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140

anti-seize or lithium grease like you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.200 
anti-seize or lithium grease like you
saw<00:03:00.820> in<00:03:00.970> those<00:03:01.090> other<00:03:01.300> plugs<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:02.650> firing<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
saw in those other plugs that firing and

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.880 
saw in those other plugs that firing and
that<00:03:04.270> plug<00:03:04.690> could<00:03:04.900> break<00:03:05.110> down<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.770> will

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that plug could break down and it will

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.580 
that plug could break down and it will
throw<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.160> check<00:03:06.460> engine<00:03:06.670> light<00:03:07.080> if<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.350> put

take very much to prevent seizing and

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.110 
take very much to prevent seizing and

threads so when you're changing plugs be

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.730 
threads so when you're changing plugs be
sure<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.620> torque<00:03:50.860> them<00:03:51.040> properly<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.870> pay

sure and torque them properly and pay

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.430 
sure and torque them properly and pay
attention<00:03:54.210> so<00:03:55.210> the<00:03:55.330> part<00:03:55.600> number<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:56.140> go

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
attention so the part number don't go
