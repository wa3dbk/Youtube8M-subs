different location outside of the server

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.729 
different location outside of the server
so<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:37.020> thing<00:00:37.110> we're<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> want<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> do

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so first thing we're going to want to do

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
so first thing we're going to want to do
is<00:00:37.890> check<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> box<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.520> says<00:00:38.610> redirect

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
is check the box that says redirect

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080 
is check the box that says redirect
request<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.140> destination<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.850> here

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
request to this destination so from here

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
request to this destination so from here
we<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.329> put<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:43.760> test<00:00:44.760> comm<00:00:45.360> slash<00:00:46.020> test<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> if

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
we can put in test comm slash test so if

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.380 
we can put in test comm slash test so if
someone<00:00:48.770> comes<00:00:49.770> into<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> default<00:00:50.850> web<00:00:51.090> site

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
someone comes into this default web site

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.770 
someone comes into this default web site
then<00:00:52.170> they'll<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.710> redirected<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.780> this

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
then they'll be redirected to this

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.200 
then they'll be redirected to this
particular<00:00:55.230> web<00:00:55.949> site<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.000> particular

want<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> destination<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
want to use this if the destination is

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
want to use this if the destination is
going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.040> outside<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.510> internal<00:01:07.290> web

that's inside this particular directory

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.850 
that's inside this particular directory
then<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.030> definitely<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> check<00:01:25.619> this

redirect them to outside of this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.649 
redirect them to outside of this
particular<00:01:33.210> directory<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
particular directory here we have the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.100 
particular directory here we have the
status<00:01:36.659> codes<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.200> found<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> default

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
status codes the found is the default

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.050 
status codes the found is the default
permanent<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:40.530> tells<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.100> client<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
permanent actually tells the client that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.569 
permanent actually tells the client that
there<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> new<00:01:42.750> location<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.009> site<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
there is a new location for the site so

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.010 
there is a new location for the site so
the<00:01:44.700> next<00:01:44.880> time<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.329> they'll

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the next time they go they'll

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749 
the next time they go they'll
automatically<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.040> site<00:01:47.310> instead<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
automatically go to that site instead of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550 
automatically go to that site instead of
having<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.270> come<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> redirected<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
having to come and be redirected and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.219 
having to come and be redirected and
then<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> temporary<00:01:51.030> site<00:01:51.329> tells<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> client

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
then the temporary site tells the client

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
then the temporary site tells the client
that<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.829> temporary<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that this is just temporary that in the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
that this is just temporary that in the
future<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.329> will<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.829> back<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.009> way<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> was

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
future it will be back to the way it was

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
future it will be back to the way it was
so<00:01:56.939> found<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.750> default<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> best<00:01:58.860> way

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so found is the default and the best way

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
so found is the default and the best way
to<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:00.600> done<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.960> can

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
to go and then when you're done you can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.649 
to go and then when you're done you can
hit<00:02:01.530> apply

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
hit apply
