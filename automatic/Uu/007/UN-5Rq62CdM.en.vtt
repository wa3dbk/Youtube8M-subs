00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.700
 a greeting from francesco to leave football 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.990
 precisely in this video I present to you 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.230
 speed 3.2 in light blue version with palm 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.800
 orange this new color is 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.509
 the only restyling that will characterize the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.779
 line and guests already previously 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.750
 output in black and palm 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.850
 neon yellow regarding this model what 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.140
 differentiates it from version 1.2 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.140
 in reality very little we say immediately that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.539
 as a model although it remains decidedly 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.329
 innovative and more traditional like 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.909
 see there is a strap placed on the 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.589
 back of the wrist thing that 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:01:00.159
 missing at 1.2 latex and the same always 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.379
 4 mm elite grip other particular thing 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.239
 because it usually changes between ones 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.360
 model and the other cut instead of 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.500
 palm and classic with external stitching 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.329
 while in 1.2 we have pinky and index 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.030
 partially rolfing an aspect 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.780
 quite evident throughout 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.159
 the glove observation is the structure 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.350
 absolutely light that 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.350
 distinguishes the spent euro line 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.960
 so if you are going or are 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.180
 looking for a very light levo glove 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.189
 speed turns out to be perfect because of how 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 you have also seen on the back the part 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.469
 in fabric and predominant 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.719
 therefore I close by repeating that the line goes 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.750
 speed which is the 3.2 we are seeing 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.149
 on video all 1.2 only very suitable gloves 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.780
 to those who want maximum but really maximum 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.780
 sensibility 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.280
 well
