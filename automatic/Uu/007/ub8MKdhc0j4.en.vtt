pretty much you used like key build he
builds<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:41.070> spam<00:00:41.579> key<00:00:41.989> projectile

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
attacks over and over and that's how you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.380 
attacks over and over and that's how you
pretty<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.020> break<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> game<00:00:47.000> be<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> like

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390

the<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> characters<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the kind of characters that I like to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
the kind of characters that I like to
play<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.940> fast<00:00:57.210> martial<00:00:57.690> artist<00:00:57.960> character

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

so<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:59.309> game<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.550> perfect<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.329> paper

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so this game was perfect for me on paper

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
so this game was perfect for me on paper
and<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> far<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.489> hasn't<00:01:02.670> been<00:01:02.879> too<00:01:03.090> successful

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and so far it hasn't been too successful

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.109 
and so far it hasn't been too successful
a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> times<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.489> bodied<00:01:05.880> by<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
a lot of times you just get bodied by a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
a lot of times you just get bodied by a
bunch<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> people<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> try<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
bunch of people if you try to go in

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.510 
bunch of people if you try to go in
close<00:01:08.700> quarters<00:01:09.680> I'm<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.040> sure<00:01:11.130> how

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
close quarters I'm not really sure how

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.690 
close quarters I'm not really sure how
viable<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.680> uh<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
viable it's going to be but uh you can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.590 
viable it's going to be but uh you can
look<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.150> stats<00:01:16.430> right<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.060> I

kind<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> risky<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.560> guess<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.580> call

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
kind of a risky I guess you could call

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
kind of a risky I guess you could call
it<00:01:23.909> an<00:01:24.150> unconventional<00:01:24.960> build<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.500> not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it an unconventional build I'm not

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.670 
it an unconventional build I'm not
really<00:01:25.830> sure<00:01:25.950> how<00:01:26.130> well<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> go

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
really sure how well it's going to go

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
really sure how well it's going to go

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
at least early game getting just one

at least early game getting just one
cancel<00:01:46.439> off<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.890> pretty<00:01:47.189> difficult<00:01:47.430> early

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
cancel off can be pretty difficult early

game for what I've seen health is to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.179 
game for what I've seen health is to
make<00:01:50.729> me<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.060> tanky<00:01:51.509> since<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> times

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
make me more tanky since a lot of times

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
make me more tanky since a lot of times
you<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.270> bum-rush<00:01:54.810> a

fun<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.560> just<00:03:11.860> there's<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.459> lot<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.670> grinding

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
fun it's just there's a lot of grinding

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.320 
fun it's just there's a lot of grinding
involved<00:03:13.570> it's<00:03:13.720> very<00:03:13.930> much<00:03:14.080> like<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.470> show

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
involved it's very much like the show

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.050 
involved it's very much like the show
you<00:03:16.330> can't<00:03:16.600> go<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.959> without<00:03:17.260> training<00:03:18.060> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
you can't go in without training you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.520 
you can't go in without training you
definitely<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.690> grind<00:03:19.930> it's<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.320> little

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
definitely have to grind it's a little

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.190 
definitely have to grind it's a little
bit<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.860> terranigma<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:22.420> you're<00:03:22.630> like<00:03:22.959> a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
bit like terranigma if you're like a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.949 
bit like terranigma if you're like a
little<00:03:23.530> bit<00:03:23.650> above<00:03:23.920> an<00:03:24.340> enemy's<00:03:24.760> level<00:03:25.150> you'll

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
little bit above an enemy's level you'll

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.660 
little bit above an enemy's level you'll
have<00:03:26.110> an<00:03:26.230> easier<00:03:26.530> time<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.830> you're<00:03:27.130> below<00:03:27.310> it's

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
have an easier time if you're below it's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.000 
have an easier time if you're below it's
going<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.910> be<00:03:28.000> quite<00:03:28.150> difficult<00:03:28.480> at<00:03:29.290> some

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
going to be quite difficult at some

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.920 
going to be quite difficult at some
point<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.520> not<00:03:30.730> even<00:03:30.880> really<00:03:31.239> about<00:03:31.420> skill

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
point it's not even really about skill

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.590 
point it's not even really about skill
like<00:03:32.290> sometimes<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.850> just<00:03:34.000> have<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.239> grind

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
like sometimes you just have to grind

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.900 
like sometimes you just have to grind
change<00:03:35.410> your<00:03:35.530> equipment<00:03:36.040> stuff<00:03:36.670> like<00:03:36.880> that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
change your equipment stuff like that

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.820 
change your equipment stuff like that

that<00:03:38.860> much<00:03:39.130> my<00:03:40.060> biggest<00:03:40.300> complaint<00:03:40.780> with<00:03:40.900> this

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
that much my biggest complaint with this

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.180 
that much my biggest complaint with this
game<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.980> dumb<00:03:42.600> Ally<00:03:43.600> AI<00:03:43.870> which<00:03:44.470> i<00:03:44.860> think

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
game is the dumb Ally AI which i think

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.820 
game is the dumb Ally AI which i think
is<00:03:45.459> pretty<00:03:45.670> inexcusable<00:03:46.620> especially<00:03:47.620> right

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
is pretty inexcusable especially right

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.500 
is pretty inexcusable especially right
now<00:03:47.860> if<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.370> state<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.730> game<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.060> in<00:03:49.239> where

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
now if the state the game is in where

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.960 
now if the state the game is in where
the<00:03:50.470> online<00:03:50.830> servers<00:03:51.280> are<00:03:51.400> screwed<00:03:51.670> up<00:03:51.790> at

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
the online servers are screwed up at

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.120 
the online servers are screwed up at
least<00:03:52.150> on<00:03:52.300> PC<00:03:52.690> it's<00:03:53.230> almost<00:03:53.470> impossible<00:03:53.800> to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
least on PC it's almost impossible to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.160 
least on PC it's almost impossible to
get<00:03:54.340> online<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.360> actually<00:03:55.570> play<00:03:55.930> with<00:03:56.080> the

get online and actually play with the
human<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.770> right<00:03:57.610> now<00:03:57.640> you're<00:03:58.000> stuck<00:03:58.239> with<00:03:58.420> the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
human so right now you're stuck with the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.210 
human so right now you're stuck with the
AI<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.200> they<00:03:59.470> don't<00:03:59.590> really<00:03:59.800> do<00:03:59.980> much<00:04:00.010> of

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
AI and they don't really do much of
