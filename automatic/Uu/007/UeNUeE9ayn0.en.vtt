held the sleds in place so that came out

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.990 
held the sleds in place so that came out
pretty<00:00:45.960> good<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.469> far<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> cables<00:00:47.579> go

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I took the 24 pin connectors shorten up

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.389 
I took the 24 pin connectors shorten up
the<00:00:51.480> cable<00:00:52.469> length<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:52.980> Reese<00:00:53.160> leaved

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the cable length and then Reese leaved

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it all with MDP see my six pin

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
it all with MDP see my six pin
connectors<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.270> made<00:00:58.050> those<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.440> scratch

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
reservoir I'm using the folks

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.500 
reservoir I'm using the folks
on<00:02:14.120> 270<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.239> 690<00:02:16.019> millimeters<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:17.310> hold<00:02:17.760> 690

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
on 270 at 690 millimeters or hold 690

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.149 
on 270 at 690 millimeters or hold 690
millimeters<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.440> fluid<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:22.099> it's<00:02:23.099> a

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
millimeters of fluid and it's a

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.080 
millimeters of fluid and it's a
beautiful<00:02:23.580> resin<00:02:23.849> form<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.150> tall<00:02:24.360> glass<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:26.519> I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
beautiful resin form a tall glass and I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.280 
beautiful resin form a tall glass and I
really<00:02:27.360> enjoyed<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:29.599> I've<00:02:30.599> got<00:02:30.780> an<00:02:30.870> LED<00:02:31.200> in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
really enjoyed it so I've got an LED in

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.559 
really enjoyed it so I've got an LED in
the<00:02:31.379> bottom<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.239> white<00:02:33.390> LED

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
the bottom of it just a white LED

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.180 
the bottom of it just a white LED
obviously<00:02:34.349> can't<00:02:34.560> say<00:02:34.680> anything<00:02:34.829> I'm<00:02:35.010> using

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
obviously can't say anything I'm using

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.399 
obviously can't say anything I'm using
Mayhem's<00:02:35.819> blueberry<00:02:36.299> pastels<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.200> kind<00:02:37.379> of

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
Mayhem's blueberry pastels so it kind of

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.020 
Mayhem's blueberry pastels so it kind of
blocks<00:02:37.620> out<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.769> color<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.579> as<00:02:38.700> far<00:02:38.849> as<00:02:38.909> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
blocks out the color and as far as the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.880 
blocks out the color and as far as the
pump<00:02:39.239> goes<00:02:39.420> that's<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.780> Swift<00:02:40.019> tech<00:02:40.230> d5<00:02:40.620> pump

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
pump goes that's the Swift tech d5 pump

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.849 
pump goes that's the Swift tech d5 pump
using<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> bits<00:02:41.489> power<00:02:41.730> mod<00:02:42.060> kit<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:42.510> top<00:02:42.769> so

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.140 

again<00:02:46.859> there's<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.690> reservoir<00:02:49.849> made<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:51.000> really

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
again there's a reservoir made it really

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.539 
again there's a reservoir made it really
easy<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.569> fill<00:02:51.720> up<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> loop<00:02:52.280> when<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> was<00:02:53.519> uh

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
easy to fill up the loop when I was uh

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.479 
easy to fill up the loop when I was uh
put<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> liquid<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.620> fluid<00:02:55.709> inside<00:02:56.190> I

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
put in the liquid or the fluid inside I

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.930 
put in the liquid or the fluid inside I
filled<00:02:57.329> up<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.480> reservoir<00:02:57.660> all<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.079> way<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
filled up the reservoir all the way and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.319 
filled up the reservoir all the way and
then<00:03:00.590> cycled<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.709> once<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.579> when<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> cycled<00:03:03.239> it

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
then cycled it once and when I cycled it

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.599 
then cycled it once and when I cycled it
that<00:03:03.510> once<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.530> whole<00:03:04.709> loop<00:03:04.950> filled<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.430> I

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
that once the whole loop filled up I

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.319 
that once the whole loop filled up I
didn't<00:03:05.790> have<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:07.370> go<00:03:08.370> crazy<00:03:08.549> with<00:03:08.909> turning<00:03:09.209> it

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
didn't have to go crazy with turning it

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.750 
didn't have to go crazy with turning it
on<00:03:09.450> or<00:03:09.510> power<00:03:09.900> cycling<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.620> made<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.579> pretty

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
on or power cycling so made it pretty

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.059 
on or power cycling so made it pretty
easy<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:15.510> uh<00:03:15.540> tubing<00:03:16.140> there<00:03:16.319> I'm<00:03:16.890> gonna

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
easy that uh tubing there I'm gonna

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.190 
easy that uh tubing there I'm gonna
process<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.639> bending<00:03:17.760> rigid<00:03:18.180> acrylic<00:03:18.540> I'm

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
process of bending rigid acrylic I'm

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.430 
process of bending rigid acrylic I'm
gonna<00:03:19.380> replace<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:19.919> that<00:03:20.099> tubing<00:03:20.780> with<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.019> UV

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
gonna replace all that tubing with a UV

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.059 
gonna replace all that tubing with a UV
reactive<00:03:23.510> ready<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.690> acrylic<00:03:25.049> from<00:03:25.380> primo

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
reactive ready to acrylic from primo

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.250 
reactive ready to acrylic from primo
chill<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:29.480> there's<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.629> again<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.139> one
