what<00:00:08.500> does<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.680> carjacker<00:00:09.309> command<00:00:09.730> a<00:00:09.760> pixel

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
what does the carjacker command a pixel

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.970 
what does the carjacker command a pixel
today<00:00:10.450> I'm<00:00:10.510> gonna<00:00:10.629> show<00:00:10.870> the<00:00:11.049> ultimate<00:00:11.530> FPS

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
today I'm gonna show the ultimate FPS

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.919 
today I'm gonna show the ultimate FPS
boost<00:00:12.280> guide<00:00:12.549> for<00:00:12.820> Daisy<00:00:12.969> Stalin<00:00:13.630> so<00:00:13.809> the

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
boost guide for Daisy Stalin so the

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.180 
boost guide for Daisy Stalin so the
reason<00:00:14.139> I<00:00:14.200> call<00:00:14.380> this<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.559> ultimate<00:00:14.980> one<00:00:15.070> is

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
reason I call this the ultimate one is

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.320 
reason I call this the ultimate one is
because<00:00:15.339> we're<00:00:15.429> gonna<00:00:15.549> do<00:00:15.730> everything<00:00:16.090> that

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
because we're gonna do everything that

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.730 
because we're gonna do everything that
you<00:00:16.390> could<00:00:16.509> possibly<00:00:16.720> do<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.349> increase<00:00:17.529> your

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
you could possibly do to increase your

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.380 
you could possibly do to increase your
FPS<00:00:17.860> that<00:00:18.340> actually<00:00:18.580> has<00:00:18.669> a<00:00:18.700> significant

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
FPS that actually has a significant

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.240 
FPS that actually has a significant
boost<00:00:19.570> so<00:00:20.259> first<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.649> all<00:00:20.710> we're<00:00:20.860> gonna<00:00:21.009> start

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
boost so first of all we're gonna start

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.159 
boost so first of all we're gonna start
off<00:00:21.369> with<00:00:21.399> the<00:00:21.579> Nvidia<00:00:22.029> users<00:00:22.419> if<00:00:22.809> you<00:00:22.869> don't

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
off with the Nvidia users if you don't

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.749 
off with the Nvidia users if you don't
already<00:00:23.290> have<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.739> GeForce<00:00:24.130> experience<00:00:24.250> it

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
already have the GeForce experience it

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.549 
already have the GeForce experience it
you<00:00:25.090> can<00:00:25.270> download<00:00:25.419> it<00:00:25.779> from<00:00:25.989> the<00:00:26.200> Nvidia

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:26.559 
you can download it from the Nvidia

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.650 
you can download it from the Nvidia
website<00:00:27.040> and<00:00:27.369> that's<00:00:27.640> really<00:00:27.880> really<00:00:28.180> cool

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
website and that's really really cool

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.479 
website and that's really really cool
it<00:00:29.020> actually<00:00:29.200> boosts<00:00:29.680> your<00:00:29.890> FPS<00:00:30.040> and

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
it actually boosts your FPS and

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.670 
it actually boosts your FPS and
optimizes<00:00:31.090> your<00:00:31.119> game<00:00:31.360> for<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:31.899> so<00:00:32.349> all<00:00:32.500> you

optimizes your game for you so all you
do<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:32.829> you<00:00:33.010> select<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.399> game<00:00:33.640> you<00:00:34.090> select

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
do is you select the game you select

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.579 
do is you select the game you select
your<00:00:34.540> preferences<00:00:35.170> when<00:00:35.320> you're<00:00:35.440> actually

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
your preferences when you're actually

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.619 
your preferences when you're actually
playing<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.100> game<00:00:36.129> and<00:00:36.460> all<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.300> have<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.480> do

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
playing the game and all you have to do

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.599 
playing the game and all you have to do
is<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:37.929> press<00:00:38.109> scan<00:00:38.410> for<00:00:38.620> games<00:00:38.800> Daisy<00:00:39.250> and

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
is just press scan for games Daisy and

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:40.889 
is just press scan for games Daisy and
then<00:00:39.760> it'll<00:00:39.910> optimize<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.449> game<00:00:40.570> for<00:00:40.780> you

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
then it'll optimize the game for you

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.150 
then it'll optimize the game for you
it's<00:00:41.050> really<00:00:41.350> good<00:00:41.530> I've<00:00:41.679> heard<00:00:41.859> great<00:00:42.039> things

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
it's really good I've heard great things

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.840 
it's really good I've heard great things
about<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.579> from<00:00:42.910> friends<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.629> it's<00:00:44.019> awesome

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
about it from friends and it's awesome

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.930 
about it from friends and it's awesome
another<00:00:45.850> thing<00:00:46.089> is<00:00:46.530> Nvidia<00:00:47.530> control<00:00:47.649> panel

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
another thing is Nvidia control panel

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.119 
another thing is Nvidia control panel
and<00:00:48.960> basically<00:00:49.960> what<00:00:50.170> we<00:00:50.260> can<00:00:50.409> do<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.710> we<00:00:50.980> can

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
and basically what we can do is we can

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.770 
and basically what we can do is we can
actually<00:00:51.219> boost<00:00:51.699> their<00:00:51.940> how<00:00:52.149> much<00:00:52.300> power<00:00:52.539> goes

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
actually boost their how much power goes

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.630 
actually boost their how much power goes
who<00:00:52.929> our<00:00:52.989> GPU<00:00:53.440> unlocking<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.100> full<00:00:54.280> potential

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
who our GPU unlocking the full potential

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.489 
who our GPU unlocking the full potential
and<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:54.969> GPU<00:00:55.359> so<00:00:55.629> first<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:55.960> all<00:00:56.050> go<00:00:56.230> to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
and the GPU so first of all go to

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.079 
and the GPU so first of all go to
program<00:00:56.920> settings<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.429> then<00:00:57.550> select<00:00:57.699> Daisy

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
program settings and then select Daisy

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.059 
program settings and then select Daisy
it's<00:00:58.780> not<00:00:58.960> already<00:00:59.199> here<00:00:59.469> just<00:00:59.649> press<00:00:59.800> add

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
it's not already here just press add

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.319 
it's not already here just press add
it's<00:01:00.309> common<00:01:00.609> enough<00:01:00.760> for<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:00.999> not<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.179> be

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
it's common enough for it not to be

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.450 
it's common enough for it not to be
there<00:01:01.539> so<00:01:02.109> yeah<00:01:02.319> scroll<00:01:03.039> down<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.309> go<00:01:03.370> to

there so yeah scroll down and go to

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
extremely worth it you'll get the most

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.960 
extremely worth it you'll get the most
FPS<00:01:17.260> from<00:01:17.410> this<00:01:17.620> if<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:18.220> have<00:01:18.370> other<00:01:18.550> graphics

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
FPS from this if you have other graphics

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.190 
FPS from this if you have other graphics
cards<00:01:19.270> I'm<00:01:19.360> sure<00:01:19.540> those<00:01:19.720> are<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.930> ways<00:01:20.050> to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
cards I'm sure those are the ways to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.080 
cards I'm sure those are the ways to
unlock<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.560> full<00:01:20.680> potential<00:01:21.010> if<00:01:21.310> not<00:01:21.550> if<00:01:21.880> it's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
unlock the full potential if not if it's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.780 
unlock the full potential if not if it's
already<00:01:22.360> using<00:01:22.690> it<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.040> now<00:01:24.190> once<00:01:24.400> we're<00:01:24.700> done

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
already using it so now once we're done

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.500 
already using it so now once we're done
with<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.090> GeForce<00:01:25.750> we<00:01:26.380> can<00:01:26.560> go<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.740> our

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
with the GeForce we can go to our

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.200 
with the GeForce we can go to our
documents<00:01:28.510> go<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.350> Daisy<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:30.160> then<00:01:30.490> go<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.640> add

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.729 
possible I've seen this on reddit a long
time<00:02:20.330> ago<00:02:20.480> can't<00:02:20.720> exactly<00:02:20.989> remember<00:02:21.260> what<00:02:21.500> it

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
time ago can't exactly remember what it

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.500 
time ago can't exactly remember what it
does<00:02:21.890> but<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.130> remember<00:02:22.550> when<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.060> was<00:02:23.150> swapping

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
does but I remember when I was swapping

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.380 
does but I remember when I was swapping
in<00:02:23.630> my<00:02:23.720> RAM<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.140> got<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> great<00:02:24.709> boost<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.550> FPS<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
in my RAM I got a great boost in FPS so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.970 
in my RAM I got a great boost in FPS so
this<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.690> mainly<00:02:26.900> catered<00:02:27.410> towards<00:02:27.680> people

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this is mainly catered towards people

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.650 
this is mainly catered towards people
who<00:02:28.010> don't<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.580> best<00:02:28.730> systems<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.390> it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
who don't have the best systems and it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.350 
who don't have the best systems and it
will<00:02:29.870> make<00:02:30.049> it<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.230> pretty<00:02:30.560> good<00:02:30.650> boost<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.190> that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
will make it a pretty good boost on that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.550 
will make it a pretty good boost on that
basically<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.510> lowest<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:32.959> how<00:02:33.140> everything

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
basically the lowest then how everything

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.430 
basically the lowest then how everything
uses<00:02:34.069> your<00:02:34.220> memory<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.660> now<00:02:35.780> once<00:02:36.140> we're<00:02:36.319> done

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
uses your memory so now once we're done

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.800 
uses your memory so now once we're done
here<00:02:36.799> we<00:02:37.250> can<00:02:37.400> go<00:02:37.549> in<00:02:37.760> game<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.269> then<00:02:38.390> adjust<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
here we can go in game and then adjust a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.070 
here we can go in game and then adjust a
sentence<00:02:39.170> that's<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> fun<00:02:39.830> part<00:02:41.019> okay<00:02:42.019> so

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
sentence that's the fun part okay so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.110 
sentence that's the fun part okay so
this<00:02:42.349> is<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.650> default<00:02:43.010> everyone<00:02:43.489> gets<00:02:43.849> when

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
this is the default everyone gets when

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.420 
this is the default everyone gets when
they<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.510> start<00:02:44.900> off<00:02:45.080> Daisy<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.950> basically

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
they just start off Daisy so basically

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.130 
they just start off Daisy so basically
this<00:02:46.700> isn't<00:02:47.000> even<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.209> good<00:02:47.330> because<00:02:48.019> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
this isn't even that good because you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.509 
this isn't even that good because you
can't<00:02:48.349> really<00:02:48.470> see<00:02:48.709> anything<00:02:48.799> yeah<00:02:49.250> sure

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
can't really see anything yeah sure

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.580 
can't really see anything yeah sure
might<00:02:49.849> look<00:02:50.030> okay<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:50.660> cinematics<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.319> stuff

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
might look okay for cinematics and stuff

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.770 
might look okay for cinematics and stuff
but<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:52.430> doesn't<00:02:52.670> look<00:02:52.819> good<00:02:53.090> at<00:02:53.360> all<00:02:53.390> so

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
but this doesn't look good at all so

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.750 
but this doesn't look good at all so
let's<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:54.380> sort<00:02:54.560> out<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.830> first<00:02:55.099> thing<00:02:55.519> so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
let's just sort out the first thing so

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.460 
let's just sort out the first thing so
video<00:02:56.330> that's<00:02:56.630> all<00:02:56.780> we're<00:02:56.870> gonna<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.080> focusing

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
video that's all we're gonna be focusing

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.360 
video that's all we're gonna be focusing
on<00:02:57.680> videos<00:02:58.519> video<00:02:59.319> now<00:03:00.319> go<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.500> vsync<00:03:00.950> make

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
on videos video now go to vsync make

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.550 
on videos video now go to vsync make
sure<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.820> off<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.690> make<00:03:03.019> basically

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
sure this is off this make basically

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.470 
sure this is off this make basically
keeps<00:03:03.950> your<00:03:04.100> frames<00:03:04.370> at<00:03:04.579> a<00:03:04.609> nice<00:03:04.850> steady<00:03:05.060> level

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
keeps your frames at a nice steady level

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.690 
keeps your frames at a nice steady level
but<00:03:06.109> you<00:03:06.200> don't<00:03:06.380> want<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.799> study<00:03:07.130> because<00:03:07.370> then

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
but you don't want to study because then

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.009 
but you don't want to study because then
you're<00:03:07.820> gonna<00:03:07.910> actually<00:03:08.060> lose<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.510> prime<00:03:08.840> so

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
you're gonna actually lose your prime so

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.599 
you're gonna actually lose your prime so
keep<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.380> disabled<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.010> your<00:03:10.160> frames<00:03:10.370> can

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
keep this disabled so your frames can

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.420 
keep this disabled so your frames can
just<00:03:10.760> run<00:03:10.940> free<00:03:11.350> rendering<00:03:12.350> resolution<00:03:12.560> turn

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
just run free rendering resolution turn

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.520

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
have problems after I would always

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.660 
have problems after I would always
suggest<00:03:17.480> leaving<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.049> 100%<00:03:19.010> no<00:03:19.130> matter<00:03:19.340> what

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
suggest leaving this 100% no matter what

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.840 
suggest leaving this 100% no matter what
now<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:21.380> playable<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.340> still<00:03:22.579> don't<00:03:22.730> like

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
now it's playable but I still don't like

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.550 
now it's playable but I still don't like
I<00:03:23.090> need<00:03:23.239> this<00:03:23.390> full<00:03:23.630> stuff<00:03:23.870> because<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.350> can't

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
I need this full stuff because you can't

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.990 
I need this full stuff because you can't
even<00:03:24.709> see<00:03:25.010> anyone<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:25.489> they're<00:03:25.639> over<00:03:25.760> there

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
even see anyone if they're over there

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.970 
even see anyone if they're over there
yeah<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.600> still<00:03:26.959> does<00:03:27.139> look<00:03:27.350> nice<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:27.769> this<00:03:27.920> is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
yeah it still does look nice but this is

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.780 
yeah it still does look nice but this is
what<00:03:28.280> we're<00:03:28.400> going<00:03:28.579> for

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
what we're going for

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.910 
what we're going for
so<00:03:29.030> guys<00:03:29.209> got<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> rendering<00:03:29.840> turn<00:03:30.590> off<00:03:30.739> an

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
so guys got a rendering turn off an

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.280 
so guys got a rendering turn off an
Alfred<00:03:31.850> coverage<00:03:32.359> leave<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.870> off<00:03:33.049> at<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
Alfred coverage leave that off at the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.780 
Alfred coverage leave that off at the
moment<00:03:33.620> there<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:33.950> known<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.489> moment

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
moment there is known at the moment

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.190 
moment there is known at the moment
there's<00:03:34.940> no<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> talk<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.690> we're<00:03:35.810> gonna<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.079> to

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
there's no a talk so we're gonna have to

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.690 
there's no a talk so we're gonna have to
really<00:03:36.410> wait<00:03:36.650> until<00:03:37.010> they<00:03:37.130> do<00:03:37.190> out<00:03:37.430> something

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
really wait until they do out something

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.460 
really wait until they do out something
like<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.940> in<00:03:38.090> but<00:03:38.630> it's<00:03:38.750> not<00:03:38.900> too<00:03:39.109> important

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
like that in but it's not too important

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.650 
like that in but it's not too important
anyway<00:03:39.680> disable<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.370> but<00:03:40.700> if<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.910> can<00:03:41.180> run

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
anyway disable this but if you can run

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.330 
anyway disable this but if you can run
it<00:03:41.780> just<00:03:42.380> put<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.709> very<00:03:42.859> high<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.220> doesn't

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
it just put it on very high it doesn't

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.920 
it just put it on very high it doesn't
make<00:03:43.639> too<00:03:43.850> much<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.239> difference<00:03:44.569> but<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.720> just

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
make too much of a difference but I just

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.680 
make too much of a difference but I just
leave<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.290> off<00:03:45.500> anyway<00:03:45.920> HD<00:03:46.730> or<00:03:46.819> quality<00:03:47.299> very

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
leave it off anyway HD or quality very

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.809 
leave it off anyway HD or quality very
low<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.200> I'm<00:03:48.380> have<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> cranked<00:03:49.370> up<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.639> low

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
low but I'm have a cranked up to low

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.789 
low but I'm have a cranked up to low
because<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.810> makes<00:03:51.049> everything<00:03:51.380> just<00:03:51.739> a

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
because it just makes everything just a

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.970 
because it just makes everything just a
clewd<00:03:52.100> more<00:03:52.900> ambient<00:03:53.900> occlusion<00:03:54.200> make<00:03:54.829> sure

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
clewd more ambient occlusion make sure

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.620 
clewd more ambient occlusion make sure
that's<00:03:55.160> disabled<00:03:55.790> as<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.329> see<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.569> just

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
that's disabled as you can see it just

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.809 
that's disabled as you can see it just
makes<00:03:56.900> everything<00:03:57.139> look<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.500> bit<00:03:57.650> more<00:03:57.819> nicer

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
makes everything look a bit more nicer

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.039 
makes everything look a bit more nicer
but<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.030> know<00:03:59.269> if<00:03:59.389> you<00:03:59.480> want<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.720> do<00:03:59.840> well<00:04:00.019> in

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
but you know if you want to do well in

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.259 
but you know if you want to do well in
dazing<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.620> want<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.859> rock<00:04:01.010> better<00:04:01.250> fps<00:04:01.430> it's

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
dazing you want to rock better fps it's

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.599 
dazing you want to rock better fps it's
probably<00:04:02.540> best<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.780> leave<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.109> off

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
probably best to leave that off

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.369 
probably best to leave that off
post-process<00:04:04.609> quality<00:04:04.939> I<00:04:05.120> put<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:06.110> very

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
post-process quality I put this on very

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.430 
post-process quality I put this on very
low<00:04:06.620> or<00:04:06.920> just

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
low or just

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.170 
low or just
all<00:04:07.650> together<00:04:07.830> as<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.580> see<00:04:08.730> everything

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
all together as you can see everything

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.820 
all together as you can see everything
is<00:04:09.300> nice<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.510> clear<00:04:09.960> we<00:04:10.140> can<00:04:10.290> actually<00:04:10.440> see

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
is nice and clear we can actually see

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.400 
is nice and clear we can actually see
little<00:04:11.160> pirates<00:04:11.880> like<00:04:12.060> over<00:04:12.360> there<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:13.050> over

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
little pirates like over there like over

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.440 
little pirates like over there like over
there<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:14.340> when<00:04:14.490> it's<00:04:14.640> cranked<00:04:15.060> up<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.210> way

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
there but when it's cranked up the way

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.070 
there but when it's cranked up the way
it<00:04:15.570> was

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
it was

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.900 
it was
everything<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.620> blurred<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.640> want<00:04:17.820> to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
everything just blurred if you want to

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.310 
everything just blurred if you want to
play<00:04:18.060> with<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.360> suggest<00:04:18.750> having<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.080> low

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
play with it I suggest having it on low

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.410 
play with it I suggest having it on low
where<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.950> keep<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.340> noise<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:21.180> know<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
where you do keep the noise you know the

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.080 
where you do keep the noise you know the
post-process<00:04:22.110> quality<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.130> some<00:04:23.310> others<00:04:23.550> in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
post-process quality but some others in

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.720 
post-process quality but some others in
Texas<00:04:24.750> bloom<00:04:25.080> make<00:04:25.830> sure<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.100> put<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.370> down

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
Texas bloom make sure you put that down

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.460 
Texas bloom make sure you put that down
because<00:04:26.970> when<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.390> move<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.930> just<00:04:28.230> it's

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
because when you move that just it's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.960 
because when you move that just it's
just<00:04:28.530> like<00:04:28.650> how<00:04:29.010> everything<00:04:29.400> works<00:04:29.640> so<00:04:29.850> when

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
just like how everything works so when

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.090 
just like how everything works so when
you<00:04:30.060> move<00:04:30.270> everything<00:04:30.780> just<00:04:30.950> meshes<00:04:31.950> in

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
you move everything just meshes in

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.520 
you move everything just meshes in
together<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.700> rotation<00:04:33.360> but<00:04:33.570> so<00:04:34.050> bloom<00:04:34.320> is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
together and rotation but so bloom is

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.860 
together and rotation but so bloom is
like<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> quality<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.490> rotation<00:04:36.450> blur<00:04:36.660> is

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
like the quality of it rotation blur is

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.380 
like the quality of it rotation blur is
more<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.800> effect<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:38.340> how<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.610> meshes<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.030> and

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
more the effect of how it meshes in and

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.880 
more the effect of how it meshes in and
it's<00:04:39.510> much<00:04:39.750> harder<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.200> spot<00:04:40.440> people<00:04:40.650> when

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
it's much harder to spot people when

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.830 
it's much harder to spot people when
this<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.190> cranked<00:04:41.520> up<00:04:41.640> so<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.300> say<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.660> have

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
this is cranked up so I say you have

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.880 
this is cranked up so I say you have
this<00:04:43.050> off<00:04:43.970> now<00:04:44.970> let's<00:04:45.210> go<00:04:45.330> into<00:04:45.450> quality

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
this off now let's go into quality

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.460 
this off now let's go into quality
basically<00:04:46.890> turn<00:04:47.160> shadows<00:04:47.640> off<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.480> clouds

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
basically turn shadows off and clouds

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.370 
basically turn shadows off and clouds
off<00:04:49.830> if<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:50.970> really<00:04:51.240> want<00:04:51.420> shadows<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.960> suggest

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
off if you really want shadows I suggest

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.290 
off if you really want shadows I suggest
leave<00:04:52.530> them<00:04:52.710> up<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:52.980> low<00:04:53.280> but<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.850> just<00:04:54.120> leave

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
leave them up on low but I just leave

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.090 
leave them up on low but I just leave
them<00:04:54.420> off<00:04:54.540> all<00:04:54.750> together<00:04:54.900> if<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.740> are<00:04:55.770> having

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
them off all together if you are having

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.670 
them off all together if you are having
problems<00:04:56.330> terrain<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.600> objects<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.230> wouldn't

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
problems terrain and objects I wouldn't

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.920 
problems terrain and objects I wouldn't
really<00:04:58.830> change<00:04:58.920> those<00:04:59.460> as<00:04:59.670> it<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.420> big<00:05:00.690> game

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
really change those as it is a big game

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.540 
really change those as it is a big game
changer<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.530> turn<00:05:01.710> those<00:05:01.890> down<00:05:02.160> all<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.460> way

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
changer to turn those down all the way

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.460 
changer to turn those down all the way
because<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:03.000> does<00:05:03.180> look<00:05:03.210> fairly<00:05:03.600> bad<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.440> I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
because it does look fairly bad so I

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.260 
because it does look fairly bad so I
just<00:05:04.710> suggest<00:05:05.100> leaving<00:05:05.610> them<00:05:05.850> as<00:05:05.970> they<00:05:06.180> are

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
just suggest leaving them as they are

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.450 
just suggest leaving them as they are
but<00:05:06.450> if<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.690> do<00:05:06.900> have<00:05:07.140> really<00:05:07.410> bad<00:05:07.590> FPS<00:05:08.010> after

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
but if you do have really bad FPS after

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.340 
but if you do have really bad FPS after
this<00:05:08.640> tutorial<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.300> suggest<00:05:09.930> turn<00:05:10.110> them<00:05:10.320> down

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
this tutorial I suggest turn them down

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.670 
this tutorial I suggest turn them down
afterwards<00:05:11.120> next<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.210> all<00:05:12.300> textures<00:05:12.870> video

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
afterwards next of all textures video

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.560 
afterwards next of all textures video
memory<00:05:14.130> always<00:05:14.370> make<00:05:14.700> sure<00:05:14.880> this<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.210> on<00:05:15.330> auto

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
memory always make sure this is on auto

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.030 
memory always make sure this is on auto
this<00:05:15.930> is<00:05:16.080> gonna<00:05:16.260> use<00:05:16.410> whatever<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.919> available

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
this is gonna use whatever is available

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.510 
this is gonna use whatever is available
in<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.610> graphics<00:05:18.000> card<00:05:18.440> texture<00:05:19.440> detail<00:05:19.830> turn

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
in the graphics card texture detail turn

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.159 
in the graphics card texture detail turn
it<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:22.790> text<00:05:23.790> your<00:05:23.880> filtering<00:05:24.330> turn<00:05:24.810> this<00:05:24.990> to

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
it and text your filtering turn this to

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.960 
it and text your filtering turn this to
low<00:05:25.290> as<00:05:25.350> well<00:05:25.620> that's<00:05:26.100> basically<00:05:26.220> gonna<00:05:26.610> turn

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
low as well that's basically gonna turn

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.700 
low as well that's basically gonna turn
like<00:05:27.240> hey<00:05:27.480> all<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.840> textures<00:05:28.230> actually<00:05:28.530> mesh

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
like hey all the textures actually mesh

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.440 
like hey all the textures actually mesh
it<00:05:28.890> together<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:29.880> don't<00:05:29.910> really<00:05:30.150> need<00:05:30.330> to

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
it together so you don't really need to

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.880 
it together so you don't really need to
worry<00:05:30.660> about<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.020> can<00:05:31.200> disable<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.680> if

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
worry about that you can disable that if

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.159 
worry about that you can disable that if
you<00:05:31.980> want<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.790> that's<00:05:33.030> pretty<00:05:33.419> much<00:05:33.660> it<00:05:33.990> now

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
you want and that's pretty much it now

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.520 
you want and that's pretty much it now
if<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.100> do<00:05:35.490> have<00:05:35.520> very<00:05:36.000> bad<00:05:36.180> FPS<00:05:36.690> even<00:05:36.930> after

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
if you do have very bad FPS even after

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.530 
if you do have very bad FPS even after
after<00:05:37.950> this<00:05:38.130> tutorial<00:05:38.669> there<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.240> something

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
after this tutorial there is something

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.600 
after this tutorial there is something
you<00:05:39.630> can<00:05:39.810> do<00:05:39.930> go<00:05:40.290> to<00:05:40.500> user<00:05:40.710> interface<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.520> go

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
you can do go to user interface and go

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.150 
you can do go to user interface and go
to<00:05:41.669> resolution<00:05:42.330> crank<00:05:42.990> this<00:05:43.110> down<00:05:43.169> to<00:05:43.500> 720

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
to resolution crank this down to 720

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.720 
to resolution crank this down to 720
piece<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.550> 1280<00:05:45.090> by<00:05:45.390> 720<00:05:45.840> p<00:05:46.230> and<00:05:46.530> then<00:05:47.340> once<00:05:47.610> you

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
piece of 1280 by 720 p and then once you

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.220 
piece of 1280 by 720 p and then once you
go<00:05:47.880> back<00:05:48.090> you'll<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.390> able<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.720> see<00:05:48.840> that<00:05:49.020> this

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
go back you'll be able to see that this

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.070 
go back you'll be able to see that this
will<00:05:49.470> now<00:05:49.710> turn<00:05:50.040> to<00:05:50.250> 1280<00:05:50.730> by<00:05:50.940> 720<00:05:51.300> p<00:05:51.690> make<00:05:51.930> sure

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
will now turn to 1280 by 720 p make sure

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.310 
will now turn to 1280 by 720 p make sure
it's<00:05:52.169> on<00:05:52.260> 100%<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:53.070> if<00:05:53.669> then<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.300> it's<00:05:55.020> still

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
it's on 100% and if then you it's still

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.650 
it's on 100% and if then you it's still
unplayable<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:56.250> suggest<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.270> should<00:05:57.330> probably

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
unplayable I suggest you should probably

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.210 
unplayable I suggest you should probably
get<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:57.930> new<00:05:58.110> PC<00:05:58.500> or<00:05:58.680> shouldn't<00:05:58.980> be<00:05:59.040> playing

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
get a new PC or shouldn't be playing

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.480 
get a new PC or shouldn't be playing
dayz<00:05:59.790> because<00:06:00.180> if<00:06:00.560> if<00:06:01.560> you<00:06:01.710> can<00:06:01.950> rely<00:06:02.160> on<00:06:02.220> those

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
dayz because if if you can rely on those

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.800 
dayz because if if you can rely on those
settings<00:06:02.880> well<00:06:03.060> then<00:06:03.210> I'm<00:06:03.330> sure<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.570> won't<00:06:03.600> be

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
settings well then I'm sure you won't be

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.659 
settings well then I'm sure you won't be
able<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:03.960> run<00:06:04.080> on<00:06:04.200> any<00:06:04.410> sentence<00:06:04.860> board<00:06:05.490> a

able to run on any sentence board a

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.820 
able to run on any sentence board a
hopefully<00:06:06.630> all<00:06:06.780> you<00:06:06.930> guys<00:06:07.140> will<00:06:07.320> be<00:06:07.410> crystal
