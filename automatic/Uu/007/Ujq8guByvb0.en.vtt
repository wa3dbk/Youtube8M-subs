00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
almost walked from their base to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.039 
almost walked from their base to
actually<00:03:16.360> go<00:03:16.450> through<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.690> then<00:03:16.810> he<00:03:16.870> brought

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
actually go through and then he brought

happen to them if they decide if the
satin<00:03:59.230> I'll<00:03:59.320> actually<00:03:59.440> get<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.739> am<00:04:00.370> big<00:04:00.850> on<00:04:00.970> top

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
satin I'll actually get a am big on top

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.259 
satin I'll actually get a am big on top
of<00:04:01.269> it<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:02.459> in<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.519> end<00:04:03.640> they<00:04:03.910> will<00:04:04.030> fall

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
of it and in the end they will fall

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.550 
of it and in the end they will fall
themselves<00:04:04.600> back

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.850 

so<00:04:12.560> 19<00:04:13.129> to<00:04:13.280> 28<00:04:13.640> 44<00:04:14.599> min<00:04:14.780> 45<00:04:15.110> minutes<00:04:15.709> is<00:04:15.830> just

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
so 19 to 28 44 min 45 minutes is just

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.610 
so 19 to 28 44 min 45 minutes is just

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
and that fight it just happened outside

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.460 
and that fight it just happened outside
the<00:05:55.490> Roshan<00:05:56.000> bit<00:05:56.240> so<00:05:56.450> it<00:05:56.780> was<00:05:56.900> pretty<00:05:57.020> even

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
the Roshan bit so it was pretty even

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
both ways but both teams didn't want to

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.300 
both ways but both teams didn't want to
make<00:05:59.450> that<00:05:59.599> move<00:05:59.810> DTS<00:06:00.680> in<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:01.010> end<00:06:01.160> thought

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
make that move DTS in the end thought

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.430 
make that move DTS in the end thought
you<00:06:01.639> know<00:06:01.760> what<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:02.450> can<00:06:02.630> do<00:06:02.780> this<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.139> once

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
you know what we can do this and once

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.560 
you know what we can do this and once

stage Alchemist is so hard not to ban
here's<00:06:10.490> this<00:06:10.610> one<00:06:10.820> of<00:06:10.880> those<00:06:10.970> here<00:06:11.210> is<00:06:11.300> they

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
here's this one of those here is they

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.540 
here's this one of those here is they
can<00:06:11.720> take<00:06:11.960> an<00:06:12.169> entire<00:06:12.320> team<00:06:12.830> while<00:06:13.400> he's

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
can take an entire team while he's

burning<00:06:13.880> you<00:06:13.970> with<00:06:14.090> radiance<00:06:14.539> it's<00:06:14.720> just<00:06:14.930> like

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
burning you with radiance it's just like

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.320 
burning you with radiance it's just like
it's<00:06:15.530> very<00:06:16.010> very<00:06:16.280> hard<00:06:16.430> and<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.940> amount<00:06:17.300> of

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
it's very very hard and the amount of

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.490 
it's very very hard and the amount of
time<00:06:17.510> it<00:06:17.660> took<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.810> actually<00:06:18.110> bring<00:06:18.229> him<00:06:18.349> down

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
time it took to actually bring him down

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.870 
time it took to actually bring him down
and<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.890> wasn't<00:06:19.159> because<00:06:19.250> I<00:06:19.400> said<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.729> word

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
and it wasn't because I said the word

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.279 
and it wasn't because I said the word
trying<00:06:20.180> no<00:06:20.390> spamming<00:06:20.659> up<00:06:20.870> as<00:06:20.960> many

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
trying no spamming up as many

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.260 
trying no spamming up as many
they<00:06:21.710> almost<00:06:21.860> had<00:06:22.219> just<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.639> while<00:06:23.089> still

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
they almost had just that while still

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.519 
they almost had just that while still
trying<00:06:23.479> to<00:06:23.539> save<00:06:23.689> enough<00:06:23.960> for<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.110> old<00:06:24.139> ones

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
trying to save enough for the old ones

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.200 
trying to save enough for the old ones
to<00:06:24.830> push<00:06:25.009> the<00:06:25.159> lanes<00:06:25.339> back<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.789> then<00:06:25.879> take<00:06:26.059> on

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
to push the lanes back and then take on

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.790 
to push the lanes back and then take on
the<00:06:26.300> rest<00:06:26.449> of<00:06:26.569> the<00:06:26.659> other<00:06:26.779> four<00:06:26.990> heroes<00:06:27.349> but

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
the rest of the other four heroes but

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.769 
the rest of the other four heroes but
activists<00:06:28.189> took<00:06:28.279> so<00:06:28.580> long<00:06:28.999> to<00:06:29.059> bring<00:06:29.449> down

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
activists took so long to bring down

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.019 
activists took so long to bring down
that<00:06:30.139> it<00:06:31.069> just<00:06:31.279> didn't<00:06:31.430> work<00:06:31.550> in<00:06:31.699> the<00:06:31.789> end<00:06:31.939> and

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
that it just didn't work in the end and

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.670 
that it just didn't work in the end and
even<00:06:32.240> then<00:06:32.360> Alchemist<00:06:32.779> brought<00:06:32.960> back<00:06:33.199> push

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
even then Alchemist brought back push

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.350 
even then Alchemist brought back push
down<00:06:33.919> the<00:06:33.949> middle<00:06:34.159> lane<00:06:34.369> and<00:06:34.580> that<00:06:34.969> was<00:06:35.149> why

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
down the middle lane and that was why

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.700 
down the middle lane and that was why
I've<00:06:35.479> actually<00:06:35.629> got<00:06:35.899> the<00:06:35.990> double<00:06:36.319> racks<00:06:36.529> in

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
I've actually got the double racks in

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.260 
I've actually got the double racks in
the<00:06:36.830> end<00:06:37.039> they<00:06:37.369> came<00:06:37.610> down<00:06:37.639> through<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.089> top

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
the end they came down through the top

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.549 
the end they came down through the top
plate<00:06:38.509> and<00:06:38.539> then<00:06:38.960> put<00:06:39.139> you<00:06:39.199> know<00:06:39.289> what

alchemist push the middle let's rotate
ourselves<00:06:41.569> around<00:06:41.659> the<00:06:41.899> creep<00:06:42.080> waves<00:06:42.229> there

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
ourselves around the creep waves there

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:43.659 
ourselves around the creep waves there
in<00:06:42.559> time<00:06:42.740> center<00:06:43.129> tower<00:06:43.309> was<00:06:43.430> brought<00:06:43.639> down

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
in time center tower was brought down

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.950 
in time center tower was brought down
and<00:06:44.119> that<00:06:44.509> equals<00:06:44.689> jejeje<00:06:45.559> so<00:06:46.460> DTS<00:06:47.089> little

and that equals jejeje so DTS little
more<00:06:48.110> to<00:06:48.169> think<00:06:48.349> about<00:06:48.409> dusa<00:06:49.189> was<00:06:49.369> definitely

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
more to think about dusa was definitely

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:51.609
