00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.520
 full of history in the basin part 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.560
 most unknown of the hotel land of 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.720
 pier at the foot of this ancient city 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.630
 medieval that abutted the three kingdoms 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.700

 of this route so we come here already to 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.790
 rest completely is a house that was 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.190
 that was the original era of your family or 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.500
 how is that good this I bought it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.660
 already 20 years or so because this 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 I was from a family that came 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.160
 200 years here this house has about 200 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.820
 years or so in its early luxury 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.860
 and I'm telling you this is all normalized 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.780

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.610
