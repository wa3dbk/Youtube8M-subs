00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hello, my friends asked me 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.210
 who is stronger in midone or house mode 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.090
 night or phantom lancer I did a survey 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.099
 and according to its results phantom won 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.570
 lancer but naturally the result is needed 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.940
 there was a check so I decided to spend 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.330
 three fights but practically in a row with 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.130
 short break with balancing 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.850
 teams that is teams well, more or less 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 equal 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.939
 although of course it's hard to evaluate the skill 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.080
 players when not to play with them and so 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.669
 I can say about the games well 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.059
 firstly the biggest problem with 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.530
 which I encountered chaos and this is what 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.989
 phantom lancer and no finger eat of course 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.570
 you can buy Dusty can ward 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.850
 but you only see the main phantom 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.739
 Lancer is if he went to stealth 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
 second skill if he got up with not gone 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 you will see in general is nothing you will not see 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 you will see a bunch of phantom lancer of money 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 it is not clear and in the mixes they 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.670
 I rarely use the second skill 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.340
 because they have no special meaning from him 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.010
 them and so too much and find 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.379
 this is difficult when you can find 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.339
 There is no real phantom 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.130
 camp 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.330
 second skill and in general it is almost always 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.430
 death phantom of three games only in 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 one chaos could win it by a miracle it 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 with equal score and general so they are not 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.580
 the surest victory when very much 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 illusions with them almost nothing 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 impossible to handle as we tried 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 collect radik when played for house of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 but radik doesn’t help much 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.220
 Now bafta nevertheless well, does not he 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.500
 I don’t have time for the desired result 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.079
 illusions burn again mjolnir or 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 miles from not working too hard 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.350
 In general , these people do absolutely 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 nothing and no vision from them 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 saves at first chaos have some 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 advantage due to becoming but by and large 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.210
 account literally level at the third already 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.700
 when home 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 chaos and in general have nothing new 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.250
 phantom and stealth can go and spear it 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 still helps them and attack and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 survive and do a lot of people but 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.549
 especially to this passivka 5 phantom lancer 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.620
 of a lot of things and chaos 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.030
 their only hope is ult but 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.010
 the moment when house of appears 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.050
 ult phantoms already very much 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.000
 to a large extent ult house of does not save 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.210
 the only way to quickly shake ult 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.590
 miss but rarely does it work 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.300
 I think that the chaos is still much 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.530
 stronger could play more 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.940
 several matches but it seems to me 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.770
 the result will be about the same 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.870
 chaos unfortunately or fortunately 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.870
 weakest phantom lancer and in home mode
