which<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> good<00:01:52.420> thing<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.759> know<00:01:54.880> once

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
which is a good thing and you know once

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.370 
which is a good thing and you know once
I<00:01:55.119> get<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.390> out<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.899> I<00:01:55.930> can<00:01:56.229> put

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
I get that out of the I can put

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.279 
I get that out of the I can put
lawn<00:01:56.590> mowers<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:56.950> stuff<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.460> there<00:01:58.289> anyway

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
lawn mowers and stuff in there anyway

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.090 
lawn mowers and stuff in there anyway
that's<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.619> plan

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
that's the plan

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.080 
that's the plan
and<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:02.770> what<00:02:02.950> we're<00:02:03.100> gonna<00:02:03.220> I'm<00:02:03.670> gonna

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
and that's what we're gonna I'm gonna

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.990 
and that's what we're gonna I'm gonna
work<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.450> today<00:02:04.509> we're<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:04.929> put<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.350> ball

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
work on today we're gonna put that ball

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.059 
work on today we're gonna put that ball
put<00:02:07.000> up<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.210> bunch<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.539> gets<00:02:07.780> poles<00:02:08.110> and

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
put up a bunch of gets poles and

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.850 
put up a bunch of gets poles and
yeah

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
yeah

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
yeah
so<00:02:10.950> how<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.100> goes<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:12.690> fence<00:02:12.900> actually

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
so how that goes this fence actually

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.700 
so how that goes this fence actually
came<00:02:13.530> together<00:02:13.680> pretty<00:02:14.070> quick<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:16.200> decided<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
came together pretty quick we decided to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.290 
came together pretty quick we decided to
go<00:02:16.860> ahead<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.220> string<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.850> session

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
go ahead and string it in session

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.080 
go ahead and string it in session
because<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.720> fence<00:02:19.020> helps<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.890> hold<00:02:20.130> itself

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
because the fence helps to hold itself

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.560 
because the fence helps to hold itself
tight<00:02:21.630> together<00:02:22.970> which<00:02:23.970> kind<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.270> helps<00:02:24.510> with

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
tight together which kind of helps with

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.340 
tight together which kind of helps with
the<00:02:24.780> process<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.080> things<00:02:28.260> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the process here one of the things I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.080 
the process here one of the things I
figured<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.340> took<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> bunch<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
figured out is that if I took a bunch of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540 
figured out is that if I took a bunch of
cloth<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.570> shoved<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.080> an<00:02:31.230> old<00:02:31.860> driver

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
cloth and shoved up an old driver

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.070 
cloth and shoved up an old driver
it<00:02:32.940> wouldn't<00:02:33.180> scar<00:02:33.510> up<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> end<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.960> these

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
it wouldn't scar up the end of these

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.380 
it wouldn't scar up the end of these
poles<00:02:34.490> like<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:35.850> here's<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.330> bit

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
poles like this one here's a little bit

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.590 
poles like this one here's a little bit
scarred<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.900> when<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.230> take<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> grinder<00:02:38.600> grind

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
scarred up when I take the grinder grind

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.060 
scarred up when I take the grinder grind
on<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.840> little<00:02:40.050> bit<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> cap<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.860> there

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
on a little bit get the cap on there

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.550 
on a little bit get the cap on there
here's<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.120> fence<00:02:42.630> stretch<00:02:42.960> that's<00:02:43.200> working

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
here's my fence stretch that's working

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.050 
here's my fence stretch that's working
out<00:02:43.620> pretty<00:02:43.800> good<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:44.550> I'll<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.790> able<00:02:44.820> to

out pretty good and what I'll be able to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.860 
out pretty good and what I'll be able to
do<00:02:45.180> now<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.570> run<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:45.930> run<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> piece<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.760> piece<00:02:48.720> of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
do now is run up run a piece of piece of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.449 
do now is run up run a piece of piece of
this<00:02:48.959> metal<00:02:49.350> down<00:02:49.530> through<00:02:49.770> here<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.190> attach

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
this metal down through here and attach

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.190 
this metal down through here and attach
my<00:02:50.490> screws<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.420> simple<00:02:51.810> right<00:02:51.930> there

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
my screws with that simple right there

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.650 
my screws with that simple right there
that<00:02:53.100> should<00:02:53.130> work<00:02:53.520> out<00:02:53.640> great<00:02:55.280> anyway<00:02:56.660> it's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
that should work out great anyway it's

share<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:01.170> here's<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> rest

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
share that with you we here's the rest

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.520 
share that with you we here's the rest
of<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:01.980> saw<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.390> ground<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> few<00:03:04.020> poles

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
of it saw on the ground with a few poles

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.960 
of it saw on the ground with a few poles
stuck<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:05.070> we<00:03:05.220> thought<00:03:05.400> we'd<00:03:05.550> string<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
stuck up we thought we'd string the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.400 
stuck up we thought we'd string the
fence<00:03:06.180> before<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:06.630> put<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.230> there

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
fence before we put that one there

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.960 
fence before we put that one there
because<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.070> gates<00:03:08.310> are<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.640> hang<00:03:08.820> on

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
because the gates are going to hang on

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.840 
because the gates are going to hang on
that<00:03:09.180> one<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.770> with<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.980> fence<00:03:11.250> on<00:03:11.490> there<00:03:11.730> it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
that one and with the fence on there it

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.490 
that one and with the fence on there it
will<00:03:11.940> help<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.330> give<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.320> extra

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
will help it to give it a little extra

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140 
will help it to give it a little extra
strength<00:03:13.980> because<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> fence<00:03:14.490> kind<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.880> helps

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
strength because the fence kind of helps

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
strength because the fence kind of helps
to<00:03:15.180> keep<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> tension<00:03:15.690> tight<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.800> everything

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
to keep the tension tight on everything

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.390 
to keep the tension tight on everything
so<00:03:17.850> there's<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.860> okay<00:03:19.860> that's<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.160> Trisha

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so there's that okay that's the Trisha

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.920 
so there's that okay that's the Trisha
Makeda<00:03:20.760> standing<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.269> front<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> fence

that<00:03:22.170> we<00:03:22.320> are<00:03:22.440> stringing<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:25.080> used

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that we are stringing up here you used

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.050 
that we are stringing up here you used
to<00:03:25.560> come<00:03:25.739> along<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.610> pole<00:03:26.820> bar

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
to come along and the little pole bar

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.780 
to come along and the little pole bar
and<00:03:27.300> we<00:03:27.360> pulled<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:27.780> nice<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.709> snug<00:03:28.950> I'm

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and we pulled this nice and snug I'm

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150 
and we pulled this nice and snug I'm
going<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.090> pick<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.080> gizmo<00:03:31.290> loose<00:03:31.769> here<00:03:32.040> and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
going to pick this gizmo loose here and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.949 
going to pick this gizmo loose here and
we're<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.420> unstring<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.870> then

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
we're going to unstring that and then

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.660 
we're going to unstring that and then
we'll<00:03:34.080> tighten<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.440> all<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.739> then<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.519> hang

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
we'll tighten it all up then we can hang
