00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
after we do all the bodywork the car was

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.950 
after we do all the bodywork the car was
heavily<00:02:44.490> damaged<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.090> an<00:02:45.180> accident<00:02:45.300> at<00:02:45.780> some

heavily damaged in an accident at some

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.170 
heavily damaged in an accident at some
point<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.350> its<00:02:46.500> life<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.700> we'll<00:02:47.910> fix

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.730 
point in its life and now we'll fix
everything<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.230> looks<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.590> new

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
everything so that it looks like new

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.150 
everything so that it looks like new
again

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
again

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.220 
again
okay<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.880> let's<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.660> look<00:02:51.810> at<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.020> third

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
okay and let's have a look at the third

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.410 
okay and let's have a look at the third
stage<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.070> obviously<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:54.210> follow

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
stage so obviously one can really follow

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.270 
stage so obviously one can really follow
the<00:02:54.630> whole<00:02:54.750> evolution<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.560> work<00:02:55.800> here<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.160> I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the whole evolution of work here and I

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.030 
the whole evolution of work here and I
see<00:02:56.820> stage<00:02:57.150> three<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.720> yeah<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> car

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
see stage three here yeah this is a car

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.710 
see stage three here yeah this is a car
that's<00:02:59.160> coming<00:02:59.520> together<00:02:59.670> again<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.510> fact

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
that's coming together again and in fact

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.780 
that's coming together again and in fact
we<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.170> painted<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> car<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.610> being

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
assembled for completion and the engine

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.460 
assembled for completion and the engine
is<00:03:05.220> already<00:03:06.140> engine<00:03:07.140> has<00:03:07.260> been<00:03:07.410> rebuilt
