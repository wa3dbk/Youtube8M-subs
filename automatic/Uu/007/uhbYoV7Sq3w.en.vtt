00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.440
 RICHEL: We're at Yakiniko now 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.720
 RICHEL: We're making things harder for them 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.940
 We are here at 2pm, and there are no customers in the area. 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.615
 They turned on the lights in the place for us 

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.234
 Rachel: These are regular prices with drinks 

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:15.364
 But we chose not to ask for any drinks so the cost would be only $ 28 

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:17.995
 We could ask for an hour and a half and then 

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:20.236
 We must finish eating everything within two hours. 

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.915
 This menu is the tabuidhay (all you can eat). 

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:26.900
 I like this menu because it contains lots of different choices for vegetables. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.955
 Different things ... For example you can order a soup or rice. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.440
 Many people ask for rice but we are not so much japanese. 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.957
 So we just ask for meat and some vegetables 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 The best thing on the menu is beef and pork. 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.034
 Since I do not know the difference between these selections in the list 

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.656
 I asked for the recommended options. So we'll see what we'll get here! 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.320
 The employee brought all this. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600
 This is great food! 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.520
 We can order as much food as we want from the menu within the next two hours. 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.460
 Shan: It will increase our weight. 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.100
 Rachel: I know! 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.835
 This is raw meat and we will cook it ourselves 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.180
 The meat is always very mushy! 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.940
 There is plenty of beef here and some pork. 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.440
 My God! The meat looks great! 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730
 Sizzling 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.320
 My God! 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.320
 The meat is so soft that the food is melted in the meat 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 The sticks were suspended in the flesh 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.174
 I want to photograph myself and I do the meat pizza to see how soft it is. 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.340
 This is unreasonable! 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.796
 The flesh melts in the mouth 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.980
 The thing that makes Japanese yekiniko very savory is the sauce they have. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.360
 The sauce is very tasty! 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.080
 I will choose the sweet sauce. I always like sweet sauce. 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.020
 Shan: I'll pick the hot sauce. 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 I will use Monday! 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.220
 The only thing you should pay attention to, is that in some places like this 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.994
 If you cook everything 

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:44.834
 And you did not eat it all, they will make you pay extra. 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 My God! 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.400
 My God!!!!!!! 

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.675
 It melts! 

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:53.394
 Shan: Is not it delicious? 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.620
 Rachel: How is your food ?? 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.180
 Shan: Delicious! 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.000
 Shan: I'm now in paradise. I told you I would gain weight. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.329
 Rachel: Since we ordered the recommended dishes, so we do not know any of these dishes in the list (names of the dishes). 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.020
 RICHEL: Chan tasted the meat one by one without the sauce. 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 In order to know which of them the best taste. 

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:14.143
 So Chan looks like the focus time. 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.504
 Shan: One of these two options 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.400
 These two. 

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:22.394
 Shan: The two fats are the best taste. 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.440
 Which melt in the mouth. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.140
 Yeah 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.700
 Okay. 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.300
 Shan: This also melts in the mouth but in my opinion this is better. 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.860
 Okay. 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.180
 We should ask this again. 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.874
 Well, I understand now. 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.940
 These two plus pork (this miso) 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.980
 It is very delicious! 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.560
 Oh my god it's so delicious! 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 We Americans became pigs, we ate almost everything. 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.040
 I will finish! 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800
 Still going on! 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.660
 I can not eat more 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.360
 We are full! 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.640
 Full of meat.
