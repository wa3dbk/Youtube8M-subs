00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.429 

my<00:02:00.579> rearview<00:02:01.579> mirror<00:02:02.119> mount<00:02:02.390> will<00:02:03.170> break

my rearview mirror mount will break

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.910 
my rearview mirror mount will break
because<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.789> was<00:02:04.969> never<00:02:05.270> designed<00:02:05.799> for<00:02:06.799> this

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
because it was never designed for this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.990 
because it was never designed for this
kind<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.340> loading<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:08.869> know<00:02:09.049> for<00:02:10.039> for<00:02:10.879> this

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
kind of loading you know for for this

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.360 
kind of loading you know for for this
kind<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.299> loading<00:02:11.629> what<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.170> was<00:02:12.470> holding<00:02:12.769> was

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
kind of loading what I was holding was

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.990 
kind of loading what I was holding was
that<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:14.629> force<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> wind<00:02:15.640> would<00:02:16.640> push

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that the force of the wind would push

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.930 
that the force of the wind would push
against<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.599> camera<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.549> would<00:02:19.549> kind<00:02:19.819> of

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
against the camera and would kind of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.390 
against the camera and would kind of
lighten<00:02:20.330> up<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.569> load<00:02:20.989> but<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.220> are

is the way I'm going to reforge this is
a<00:05:03.450> i<00:05:04.200> think<00:05:04.770> what<00:05:04.860> i<00:05:04.920> really<00:05:05.280> need<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.550> do<00:05:05.730> is<00:05:05.940> I

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
a i think what i really need to do is I

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.170 
a i think what i really need to do is I
need<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.750> add<00:05:06.900> another<00:05:07.170> rib<00:05:07.920> somehow<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.760> this

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
need to add another rib somehow to this

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.570 
need to add another rib somehow to this
thing<00:05:09.420> so<00:05:10.290> this<00:05:10.500> things<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.890> vibrate<00:05:10.920> so

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
much yeah I think that's going to be my

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.520 
much yeah I think that's going to be my
next<00:05:15.290> evolution<00:05:16.290> of<00:05:16.410> this<00:05:16.560> thing<00:05:18.230> you<00:05:19.230> see<00:05:19.410> is
