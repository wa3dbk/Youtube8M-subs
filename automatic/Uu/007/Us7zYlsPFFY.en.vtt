LTE<00:01:48.049> capabilities<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.340> not

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
LTE capabilities it probably will not

have NFC capabilities if it does have
NFC<00:01:54.090> capabilities<00:01:54.530> it'll<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.649> funny<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.040> how

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
NFC capabilities it'll be funny on how

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.690 
NFC capabilities it'll be funny on how
Apple<00:01:56.909> tries<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.299> spin<00:01:57.600> NFC<00:01:58.320> into<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.979> good

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
Apple tries to spin NFC into a good

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.260 
Apple tries to spin NFC into a good
thing<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.649> they<00:02:01.649> were<00:02:01.710> mocking<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> trying

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
thing as they were mocking it and trying

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
thing as they were mocking it and trying
to<00:02:03.390> downplay<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.229> these<00:02:04.409> years<00:02:04.710> because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
to downplay it all these years because

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
to downplay it all these years because
their<00:02:05.399> device<00:02:05.790> does<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.030> happen

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
their device does not happen

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.650 
their device does not happen
it's<00:02:07.990> probably<00:02:08.259> going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> come<00:02:08.770> with<00:02:09.160> an

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's probably going to come with an

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's probably going to come with an
upgraded<00:02:10.660> processor<00:02:11.519> up<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.819> quad-core

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
upgraded processor up to a quad-core

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.400 
upgraded processor up to a quad-core
probably<00:02:13.930> around<00:02:14.170> 1.2<00:02:14.950> gigahertz<00:02:15.540> 1.4<00:02:16.540> tops

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.150 

maybe<00:02:20.410> go<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:20.950> 22<00:02:21.340> gigs<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.819> ram<00:02:23.040> they're<00:02:24.040> gonna

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
maybe go up 22 gigs of ram they're gonna

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.699 
maybe go up 22 gigs of ram they're gonna
probably<00:02:25.030> try<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.690> bump<00:02:26.050> up<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.349> camera

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
probably try to bump up the camera

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.710 
probably try to bump up the camera
because<00:02:27.040> every<00:02:27.459> smartphone<00:02:27.910> out<00:02:28.239> there<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
because every smartphone out there is

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.670 
and 64 I don't know why everybody was
thinking<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.570> 64<00:04:42.110> wasn't<00:04:42.410> going<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.590> be

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
thinking that 64 wasn't going to be

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.760 
thinking that 64 wasn't going to be
there<00:04:42.919> even<00:04:43.160> though<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:44.480> does<00:04:44.870> have<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.110> microSD

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
there even though it does have a microSD

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.180 
there even though it does have a microSD
slot<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.250> can<00:04:46.370> hold<00:04:46.520> another<00:04:46.790> 64<00:04:47.450> so<00:04:48.190> gotta

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
slot that can hold another 64 so gotta

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.970 
slot that can hold another 64 so gotta
be<00:04:49.370> incredible<00:04:49.850> amount<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.180> memory

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980

there what else 2600 mAh battery I know
a<00:05:24.350> lot<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.560> people<00:05:24.650> wondering<00:05:25.370> about<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.610> is

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
a lot of people wondering about that is

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.480 
a lot of people wondering about that is
that<00:05:26.570> going<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.810> be<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.950> that<00:05:28.160> going<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.340> hold

that going to be is that going to hold

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.620 
that going to be is that going to hold
true<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:29.030> hope<00:05:29.450> so<00:05:29.919> because<00:05:30.919> a<00:05:31.130> nice<00:05:31.430> 2600<00:05:32.240> mAh

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
true I hope so because a nice 2600 mAh

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.110 
true I hope so because a nice 2600 mAh
battery<00:05:33.430> would<00:05:34.430> last<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.880> long<00:05:35.060> time

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
battery would last a long time

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.690 
battery would last a long time
especially<00:05:35.660> with<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.110> new<00:05:36.320> display<00:05:36.680> that<00:05:36.919> can

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
especially with a new display that can

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.850 
especially with a new display that can
save<00:05:37.970> power<00:05:38.270> these<00:05:38.780> new<00:05:38.990> processes<00:05:39.680> that<00:05:39.800> I

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
save power these new processes that I

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.800 
save power these new processes that I
can<00:05:40.010> save<00:05:40.220> power<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.820> mean<00:05:41.330> remember<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:43.810> the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
can save power I mean remember the the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.430 
can save power I mean remember the the
quad-core<00:05:46.210> Snapdragon<00:05:47.210> 600<00:05:47.720> processor<00:05:47.750> will

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor will

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.060 
quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor will
probably<00:05:49.100> a<00:05:49.130> 1.8<00:05:49.880> giga<00:05:50.090> hardcore<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.350> then

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
probably a 1.8 giga hardcore and then

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.950 
probably a 1.8 giga hardcore and then
the<00:05:52.400> other<00:05:52.820> one<00:05:53.320> will<00:05:54.320> be<00:05:54.350> a<00:05:54.860> an<00:05:55.960> eight-core

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
the other one will be a an eight-core

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.950 
the other one will be a an eight-core
processor<00:05:57.039> where<00:05:58.039> it<00:05:58.190> has<00:05:58.370> two<00:05:59.210> four<00:05:59.599> cores

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
processor where it has two four cores

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.180 
processor where it has two four cores
like<00:06:00.380> one<00:06:00.650> would<00:06:00.860> be

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
like one would be

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.230 
like one would be
a<00:06:01.420> 1.2<00:06:02.420> gigahertz<00:06:02.810> quad-core<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:04.310> then<00:06:05.030> like

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core and then like

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.100 
a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core and then like
another<00:06:05.510> 1.8<00:06:06.290> giga<00:06:06.530> hurt<00:06:06.800> quad-core<00:06:08.110> those

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
another 1.8 giga hurt quad-core those

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.460 
another 1.8 giga hurt quad-core those
would<00:06:09.260> be<00:06:09.350> the<00:06:09.380> two<00:06:09.530> different<00:06:09.920> versions<00:06:10.420> but

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
would be the two different versions but

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.600 
would be the two different versions but
that<00:06:12.470> could<00:06:12.650> possibly<00:06:13.010> be<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.250> new

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
that could possibly be the new

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.240 
that could possibly be the new
smartphone<00:06:14.300> coming<00:06:14.960> from<00:06:15.140> Samsung<00:06:15.800> that<00:06:16.100> we
