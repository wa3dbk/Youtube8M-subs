00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.459
 Everything's alright, beauty, erased everything. 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.760
 probably the first time you 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.590
 You will need to because you enable 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.510
 clock you have to do this 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.700
 procedure without activating you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.440
 can not even use it as a clock 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.730
 to see the time because it stands still 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.730
 on this little screen 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.640

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.959

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.400
 application profite and has a rash and 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.169

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.610
 will try to synchronize 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.970
 You can make a mistake at that time, and then you 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.370
 Are you going to have to restart yours? 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.459

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.489
