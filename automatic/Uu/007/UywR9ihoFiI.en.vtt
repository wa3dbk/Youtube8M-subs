like it's not even taking that long you
just<00:02:11.350> roll<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.710> up<00:02:11.950> I'm<00:02:12.760> pretty<00:02:13.450> sure<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.780> when

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
just roll it up I'm pretty sure it when

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.270 
just roll it up I'm pretty sure it when
I<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> tried<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.680> before<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.980> other<00:02:15.100> day

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
I when I tried it before the other day

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.180 
I when I tried it before the other day
when<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:15.850> goofing<00:02:16.390> around<00:02:16.510> um<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
when I was just goofing around um I

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.530 
when I was just goofing around um I
think<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.550> rolled<00:02:18.760> them<00:02:18.880> too<00:02:19.060> tight<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.450> they

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
think I rolled them too tight and they

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.070 
think I rolled them too tight and they
were<00:02:19.630> kind<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.870> hard<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.230> out<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:22.080> know

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
were kind of hard to get out so you know

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.700 
were kind of hard to get out so you know
just<00:02:23.440> be<00:02:23.620> careful<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:31.020> also<00:02:32.020> got<00:02:32.230> my<00:02:32.320> armpits

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
