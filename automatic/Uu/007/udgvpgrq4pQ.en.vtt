out first thing i'll go over is the
rotation<00:00:29.210> before

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.790 

4.1<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:34.090> rotation<00:00:34.510> was<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.809> 696<00:00:35.200> rotation

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
4.1 the rotation was the 696 rotation

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.069 
4.1 the rotation was the 696 rotation
that<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.640> now<00:00:36.760> obsolete<00:00:36.970> because<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.660> various

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
that is now obsolete because of various

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.650 
that is now obsolete because of various
changes

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.170 

so<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:42.970> will<00:00:43.970> go<00:00:44.420> over<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.079> new<00:00:45.880> rotation<00:00:46.880> with

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
so I will go over the new rotation with

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.390 
so I will go over the new rotation with
you<00:00:47.300> which<00:00:47.630> is<00:00:47.810> now<00:00:48.080> dubbed<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.590> 393<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.340> the

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
you which is now dubbed the 393 of the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.670 
you which is now dubbed the 393 of the
939<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.270> show<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.200> exactly<00:00:51.470> how<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.800> works

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
939 and show you exactly how it works

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.330 
939 and show you exactly how it works
so<00:00:54.250> basically<00:00:54.670> what<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.090> 393<00:00:55.690> is<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.500> you

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
so basically what the 393 is is you

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.580 
so basically what the 393 is is you
start<00:00:57.550> off<00:00:57.700> with<00:00:57.880> a<00:00:57.910> vendor<00:00:58.450> shield<00:00:58.810> and<00:00:59.080> you
