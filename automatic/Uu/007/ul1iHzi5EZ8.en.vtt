 name surname surname 21 years team 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.930
 of belonging 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 olympic in Milan jersey number 5 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.290
 which basketball players inspire you but 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.450
 there is not one in particular I have 23 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.780
 I really like some players 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.610
 they play in Europe as spanu and others 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 members and as kobe bryant 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.980
 the best game when we are in 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:56.489
 final for Europeans under 20 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:58.910
 the worst thing you do next 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910
 training 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.329
 depends on whether I am very tired right away 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.369
 shower and go home or stay a 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.999
 do some more shooting but her down 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.999
 favorite dish 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.729
 the pizza to a superstitious ritual pre 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.729
 game 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:33.210
 however , I don't believe in winners either 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.810
 much to these things 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.380
 who wins the championship this year not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.610
 you succeed 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.420
 Pescara or indeed this is what the hours 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.420
 you like your team 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.799
 from the beginning then let's say a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.580
 very important factor where teams 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.440
 present in our strong point 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.210
 there are some very nice guys too 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.210
 so let's do a nice scene 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.229
 nothing I like the spirit that knows of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.959
 fight the desire to win that is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.110
 proving what you like about the team 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.110
 opposing 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.110
 many maturity and experience 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.930
 the alloy when it is natural that they go wrong 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.329
 to the forum to see them because I like it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.000
 but it is definitely have a great talent 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.220
 and even if they are they are doing some 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.150
 fatigue I think they are one of the teams 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.390
 better than central favorite choir ce 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.950
 there is only one 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.810
 I actually say that it is not really sandro 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:55.769
 my name shows good we accept them 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 let us forgive for this heaven you sing me 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.480
 shame on me, what does it mean to 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.319
 opposing team before the derby of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 Monday 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.030
 unfortunately for them because in my opinion 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.300
 will win the championship though 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.830
 the data they beat us last 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.170
 championship over and over again 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.180
 I wish him a good one anyway 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.260
 game but hoping that in the end we are 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.260
 us to friends
