this<00:00:01.410> lesson<00:00:01.829> brings<00:00:02.429> up<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.790> very<00:00:02.820> crucially

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
this lesson brings up a very crucially

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.590 
this lesson brings up a very crucially
important<00:00:04.110> concept<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:04.799> lymph<00:00:05.250> node

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
important concept in lymph node

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.500 
important concept in lymph node
pathology<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.810> lymphomas<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.740> general

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
pathology and lymphomas in general

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.209 
pathology and lymphomas in general
remember<00:00:09.510> we've<00:00:10.019> already<00:00:10.260> said<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.920> million

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
remember we've already said a million

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.980 
remember we've already said a million
times<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.090> our<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> diagnosis<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
times that in our to diagnosis of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.770 
times that in our to diagnosis of
lymphoma<00:00:13.160> you<00:00:14.160> need<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.670> basement<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
lymphoma you need a basement of the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.340 
lymphoma you need a basement of the
lymph<00:00:15.990> node<00:00:16.230> well<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.310> should<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.970> said<00:00:18.350> 100

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
lymph node well I should have said 100

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.210 
lymph node well I should have said 100
percent<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.070> basement<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:21.630> yes<00:00:22.220> sometimes

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
percent a basement because yes sometimes

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.640 
percent a basement because yes sometimes
in<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:23.640> early<00:00:24.420> stages<00:00:24.779> if<00:00:25.170> you're<00:00:25.380> lucky

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
in very early stages if you're lucky

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.429 
in very early stages if you're lucky
perhaps<00:00:26.460> only<00:00:26.880> part<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.660> lymph<00:00:27.869> node<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
perhaps only part of a lymph node is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.669 
perhaps only part of a lymph node is
lymphoma<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:29.970> practical<00:00:30.210> purposes

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
lymphoma but for all practical purposes

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
lymphoma but for all practical purposes
ninety<00:00:31.679> something<00:00:32.189> percent<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> time<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
ninety something percent of the time the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
ninety something percent of the time the
whole<00:00:34.410> lymph<00:00:34.829> node<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.340> destroyed<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
whole lymph node is destroyed in the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.049 
whole lymph node is destroyed in the
lymphoma<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.780> effaced<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.739> should<00:00:38.010> say<00:00:38.250> well

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
lymphoma or effaced I should say well

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.310 
lymphoma or effaced I should say well
the<00:00:39.300> reason<00:00:39.329> why<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:39.840> gonna<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> little

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the reason why we're gonna have a little

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
the reason why we're gonna have a little
problem<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.219> case<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:41.910> guess

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
problem with this case is because guess

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.069 
problem with this case is because guess
what<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.660> follicles<00:00:45.660> with

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
what we do see some follicles with

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
what we do see some follicles with
germinal<00:00:46.710> centers<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.309> towards<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
germinal centers out towards the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.279 
germinal centers out towards the
periphery<00:00:48.230> we<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.190> sub<00:00:50.879> capsular<00:00:51.780> sinus

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
periphery we do see a sub capsular sinus

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.580 
periphery we do see a sub capsular sinus
it<00:00:53.039> looks<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.969> North<00:00:54.329> West<00:00:54.719> third<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it looks like the North West third of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.490 
it looks like the North West third of
this<00:00:56.520> lymph<00:00:56.820> node<00:00:57.090> could<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.570> easily<00:00:57.660> be

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this lymph node could very easily be

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
this lymph node could very easily be
kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.890> normal<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.180> other<00:01:00.329> two-thirds

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
kind of normal but the other two-thirds

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.280 
kind of normal but the other two-thirds
is<00:01:01.140> based<00:01:01.680> by<00:01:02.010> these<00:01:02.280> cells<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
is based by these cells so is this a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
is based by these cells so is this a
lymphoma<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> already<00:01:05.430> told<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
lymphoma well I already told you it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
lymphoma well I already told you it
probably<00:01:06.299> isn't<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> usually

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
probably isn't because this usually

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
probably isn't because this usually
doesn't<00:01:08.189> happen<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.990> else<00:01:10.170> could<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.500> be

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
doesn't happen so what else could it be

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.300 
doesn't happen so what else could it be
well<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.420> court<00:01:13.229> theorizing<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
well let's look in court theorizing and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.450 
well let's look in court theorizing and
figure<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.000> ourselves<00:01:16.220> let's<00:01:17.220> look

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
figure it out for ourselves let's look

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170 
figure it out for ourselves let's look
in<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.790> area<00:01:19.400> which<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.520> hope<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.850> come<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
in this area which I hope will come to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.580 
in this area which I hope will come to
focus<00:01:21.600> pretty<00:01:21.869> soon<00:01:25.040> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> area

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
focus pretty soon in the area

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.270 
focus pretty soon in the area
that<00:01:26.859> was<00:01:27.119> erased<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.899> which<00:01:29.439> we<00:01:29.619> do<00:01:29.799> not<00:01:29.829> have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
that was erased in which we do not have

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.149 
that was erased in which we do not have
the<00:01:30.460> normal<00:01:30.880> lymph<00:01:31.630> node<00:01:31.840> architecture<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the normal lymph node architecture and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.109 
the normal lymph node architecture and
notice<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:41.069> yeah<00:01:42.069> there's<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.369> lot<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.819> cells

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
notice that yeah there's a lot of cells

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.649 
notice that yeah there's a lot of cells
that<00:01:43.270> look<00:01:43.630> like<00:01:43.810> lymphocytes

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that look like lymphocytes

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:55.370 
that look like lymphocytes
but<00:01:46.659> are<00:01:46.899> there<00:01:47.110> any<00:01:47.140> other<00:01:47.649> kinds<00:01:48.189> of<00:01:48.310> cells

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.789 

and<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:57.789> will<00:01:58.270> soon<00:01:58.659> see<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:01.500> even<00:02:02.500> though

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
and you will soon see that even though

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.010 
and you will soon see that even though
the<00:02:02.970> majority<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.000> these<00:02:04.179> cells<00:02:04.479> look<00:02:04.719> kind<00:02:04.929> of

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
the majority of these cells look kind of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.089 
the majority of these cells look kind of
lymphoid<00:02:05.439> take<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.069> look<00:02:06.369> over<00:02:07.149> here<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:08.099> here

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
lymphoid take a look over here in here

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.819 
lymphoid take a look over here in here
could<00:02:10.090> these<00:02:10.239> be<00:02:10.299> perhaps<00:02:10.810> some<00:02:11.290> other<00:02:11.500> kind

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
could these be perhaps some other kind

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.880 
could these be perhaps some other kind
of<00:02:11.980> cell<00:02:12.220> let's<00:02:12.879> take<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> look<00:02:13.299> at<00:02:13.420> these

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
of cell let's take a look at these

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.490 
of cell let's take a look at these
darker<00:02:14.890> more<00:02:15.190> irregular<00:02:15.760> cells<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.599> go<00:02:17.440> to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
darker more irregular cells and go to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.030 
darker more irregular cells and go to
their<00:02:17.769> highest<00:02:18.160> power<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:20.349> think<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.799> could

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
their highest power and I think I could

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
their highest power and I think I could
convince<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:22.000> these<00:02:22.870> are<00:02:23.049> probably<00:02:23.799> not

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
convince you that these are probably not

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.910 
convince you that these are probably not
lymphocytes<00:02:25.840> or<00:02:25.989> history<00:02:26.319> lights<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.769> any

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
lymphocytes or history lights of any

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.789 
lymphocytes or history lights of any
time<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.700> any<00:02:28.120> sorts<00:02:28.599> they<00:02:29.019> have<00:02:29.200> more<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
time of any sorts they have more of a

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.699 
time of any sorts they have more of a
cohesiveness<00:02:30.519> they<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.690> other<00:02:32.049> features<00:02:32.500> of

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
cohesiveness they have other features of

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.270 
cohesiveness they have other features of
malignancy<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.209> actually<00:02:35.019> this<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:35.950> case<00:02:36.250> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
malignancy so actually this is a case of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.520 
malignancy so actually this is a case of
metastatic<00:02:37.060> carcinoma<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:38.109> a<00:02:38.139> lymph<00:02:38.470> node

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
metastatic carcinoma to a lymph node

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.400 
metastatic carcinoma to a lymph node
which<00:02:39.340> would<00:02:39.519> explain<00:02:39.880> why<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.900> lymph<00:02:41.139> node

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
which would explain why the lymph node

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.759 
which would explain why the lymph node
is<00:02:41.680> partially<00:02:42.549> based<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:44.260> most

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
is partially based because most

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.879 
is partially based because most
metastatic<00:02:45.430> carcinomas<00:02:46.389> do<00:02:47.109> not<00:02:47.380> involve

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
metastatic carcinomas do not involve

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.670 
metastatic carcinomas do not involve
entire<00:02:48.549> lymph<00:02:49.030> nodes<00:02:49.359> you<00:02:49.989> could<00:02:50.109> see<00:02:50.260> areas

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
entire lymph nodes you could see areas

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.190 
entire lymph nodes you could see areas
of<00:02:50.709> normal<00:02:51.400> lymph<00:02:52.000> node<00:02:52.239> architecture

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
of normal lymph node architecture

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.909 
of normal lymph node architecture
perhaps<00:02:53.590> being<00:02:54.030> effaced<00:02:55.030> by<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:56.590> groups

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
perhaps being effaced by little groups

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.699 
perhaps being effaced by little groups
of<00:02:57.250> metastatic<00:02:57.940> cells<00:02:58.359> coming<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
of metastatic cells coming in but the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.280 
of metastatic cells coming in but the
opposite<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.430> true<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:01.260> lymphomas<00:03:02.260> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
opposite is true in lymphomas and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.319 
opposite is true in lymphomas and
lymphomas<00:03:03.040> they're<00:03:03.190> almost<00:03:03.549> always<00:03:03.849> a

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
lymphomas they're almost always a

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.470 
lymphomas they're almost always a
hundred<00:03:05.109> percent<00:03:05.290> effaced<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:07.150> doesn't

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
hundred percent effaced and it doesn't

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.349 
hundred percent effaced and it doesn't
matter<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.900> was<00:03:08.139> breast<00:03:08.470> carcinoma<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:09.489> could

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
matter this was breast carcinoma I could

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.080 
matter this was breast carcinoma I could
tell<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.959> was<00:03:11.109> any<00:03:11.349> adenocarcinoma<00:03:12.090> you'd

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
tell you it was any adenocarcinoma you'd

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.059 
tell you it was any adenocarcinoma you'd
probably<00:03:13.480> believe<00:03:13.780> me<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.680> would<00:03:14.829> anybody

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
probably believe me and so would anybody

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.339 
probably believe me and so would anybody
else<00:03:15.489> because<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.359> could<00:03:16.599> say<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.959> these<00:03:17.109> cells

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
else because I could say is these cells

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.140 
else because I could say is these cells
are<00:03:17.470> malignant<00:03:17.859> they're<00:03:18.760> kind<00:03:19.030> of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
are malignant they're kind of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.670 
are malignant they're kind of
interspersed<00:03:19.950> with<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:22.019> lymphocytes<00:03:23.019> and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
interspersed with the lymphocytes and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.620 
interspersed with the lymphocytes and
this<00:03:24.099> is<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> lymphoma<00:03:24.910> at<00:03:25.150> all<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.480> is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
this is not a lymphoma at all this is

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.140 
this is not a lymphoma at all this is
metastatic<00:03:26.019> breast<00:03:26.230> carcinoma<00:03:26.819> let<00:03:27.819> me<00:03:27.940> click

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
metastatic breast carcinoma let me click

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.020 
metastatic breast carcinoma let me click
on<00:03:28.299> another<00:03:28.599> couple<00:03:29.260> areas<00:03:29.530> here<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.220> hope<00:03:30.849> I

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
on another couple areas here and hope I

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.259 
on another couple areas here and hope I
could<00:03:31.090> focus<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.810> better<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.549> yes<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.730> can<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
could focus in better and yes I can and

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.630 
could focus in better and yes I can and
in<00:03:34.389> this<00:03:34.510> area<00:03:34.840> all<00:03:35.590> around<00:03:35.650> here<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.430> see

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
in this area all around here you see

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.890 
in this area all around here you see
lymphocytes<00:03:37.269> but<00:03:37.569> in<00:03:38.260> all<00:03:38.469> areas<00:03:39.010> around<00:03:39.189> here

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
lymphocytes but in all areas around here

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.770 
lymphocytes but in all areas around here
you<00:03:40.230> see<00:03:40.470> metastatic<00:03:41.010> carcinoma<00:03:41.510> these<00:03:42.510> cells

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
you see metastatic carcinoma these cells

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.710 
you see metastatic carcinoma these cells
would<00:03:42.989> have<00:03:43.310> epithelial<00:03:44.310> markers<00:03:44.879> whereas

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
would have epithelial markers whereas

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.050 
would have epithelial markers whereas
all<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.019> these<00:03:46.379> cells<00:03:46.650> would<00:03:47.069> have<00:03:47.129> lymphoid

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
all of these cells would have lymphoid

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.819 
all of these cells would have lymphoid
markers<00:03:48.829> thank<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.010> very<00:03:50.220> much
