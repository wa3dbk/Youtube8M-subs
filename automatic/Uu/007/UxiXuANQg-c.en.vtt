these<00:00:21.430> statues<00:00:21.849> they're<00:00:22.029> made<00:00:22.180> of<00:00:22.330> PVC<00:00:23.109> you

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
know some sort of plastic but this one

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.450 
know some sort of plastic but this one
is<00:00:25.510> rather<00:00:26.320> nice<00:00:26.560> because<00:00:26.769> it's<00:00:26.949> made<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.189> cold

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460

is rather nice because it's made of cold
cast<00:00:27.730> porcelain<00:00:28.509> so<00:00:28.900> it<00:00:28.960> feels<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.230> bit<00:00:29.320> more

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
cast porcelain so it feels a bit more

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.560 
cast porcelain so it feels a bit more
quality<00:00:29.949> to<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.189> standard<00:00:30.580> ones<00:00:30.730> it's<00:00:31.390> not<00:00:31.449> a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
quality to the standard ones it's not a

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.910 
quality to the standard ones it's not a
limited<00:00:31.929> edition<00:00:32.410> or<00:00:32.500> anything<00:00:32.650> like<00:00:32.860> that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
limited edition or anything like that

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.800 
limited edition or anything like that
but<00:00:33.370> it<00:00:33.490> is<00:00:33.520> quite<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:33.910> nice<00:00:34.090> statue<00:00:34.420> there's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810

generally<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.390> looks<00:01:45.509> pretty<00:01:45.780> nice<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.320> couple

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
generally it looks pretty nice a couple

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.960 
generally it looks pretty nice a couple
of<00:01:47.100> things<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.840> maybe<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.110> quite<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.530> nice

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
of things that maybe not quite so nice

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.020 
of things that maybe not quite so nice
is<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.890> glass<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:53.640> they're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
is that the glass is because they're

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.830 
is that the glass is because they're
fixed<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.539> their<00:01:54.689> face<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.939> think<00:01:56.939> they're<00:01:57.659> look

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
fixed to their face I think they're look

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.450 
fixed to their face I think they're look
okay<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:59.070> look<00:01:59.280> better

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
okay but I think they might look better

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
okay but I think they might look better
if<00:01:59.670> they<00:01:59.789> were<00:01:59.850> separate<00:02:00.330> but<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.720> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
if they were separate but then it's a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.639 
if they were separate but then it's a
porcelain<00:02:01.170> statue<00:02:01.619> say<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:03.600> under<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
porcelain statue say just under that I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.320 
porcelain statue say just under that I
think<00:02:04.890> my<00:02:04.950> hair<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.159> done<00:02:05.490> quite<00:02:05.670> nicely<00:02:05.729> for

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
think my hair is done quite nicely for
