00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
look up all the way up I couldn't look

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
look up all the way up I couldn't look
to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.020> side<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> could<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to the side and I could look to the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.550 
to the side and I could look to the
other<00:01:40.020> side<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.780> heads<00:01:43.049> got<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
other side so the heads got a lot of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.780 
other side so the heads got a lot of
movement<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.490> legs<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:45.149> move<00:01:45.180> forward

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
movement then the legs can move forward

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.030 
movement then the legs can move forward
backwards<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.270> 360<00:01:49.079> degrees<00:01:49.619> because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
backwards but not 360 degrees because

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.270 
backwards but not 360 degrees because
they're<00:01:50.250> too<00:01:50.430> long<00:01:51.560> they<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.619> move<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they're too long they can move in and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.170 
they're too long they can move in and
out<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> body<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:55.890> too<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:56.909> because

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
out of the body but not too much because

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.380 
out of the body but not too much because
they're<00:01:57.780> limited<00:01:58.140> movement<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.610> of<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
they're limited movement because of the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.900 
they're limited movement because of the
body<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:02.490> waist<00:02:03.619> twist<00:02:04.619> round<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.910> that's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
body and the waist twist round so that's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.990 
body and the waist twist round so that's
the<00:02:09.209> figure<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.810> robot<00:02:10.500> mode<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.950> will<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:11.970> show

and put them down to the side do the
same<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.810> other<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
same with the other one and then the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.960 
same with the other one and then the
faith<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.490> can<00:03:02.670> twist<00:03:02.940> them<00:03:03.150> around<00:03:04.970> will

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
faith here we can twist them around will

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:16.160 
faith here we can twist them around will
do<00:03:06.090> them<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:13.740> then<00:03:14.150> finally<00:03:15.170> there's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
do them like so and then finally there's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.850 
do them like so and then finally there's
a<00:03:16.290> better<00:03:16.440> autumn<00:03:16.890> more<00:03:17.070> from<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.400> figure

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
a better autumn more from this figure

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.280 
a better autumn more from this figure
there's<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.980> nose<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.610> back<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.970> just

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.150 

fold<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:25.620> ass<00:03:26.030> pull<00:03:27.030> up<00:03:27.180> dime<00:03:27.980> unfold<00:03:28.980> it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
fold up like ass pull up dime unfold it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.790 
fold up like ass pull up dime unfold it
the<00:03:29.430> rest<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.850> way<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.630> can<00:03:30.750> see<00:03:31.019> when

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
the rest of the way as you can see when

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.060 
the rest of the way as you can see when
I'm<00:03:31.920> doing<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.370> his<00:03:32.670> head<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.300> folding<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.080> so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
I'm doing that his head is folding in so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.850 
I'm doing that his head is folding in so
and<00:03:35.940> there<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.230> interstellar<00:03:38.220> jet

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
and there you have the interstellar jet

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.040 
and there you have the interstellar jet
now<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.670> mode<00:03:42.000> as<00:03:42.209> well<00:03:42.239> there's<00:03:42.840> no

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
now I like this mode as well there's no

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.860 
now I like this mode as well there's no
flaws<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.830> movement<00:03:44.070> like<00:03:44.760> there<00:03:45.630> isn't

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
flaws in this movement like there isn't

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.930 
flaws in this movement like there isn't
any<00:03:46.260> flaws<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.220> there<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.519> an<00:03:47.640> anti

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
any flaws here and there as an anti

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.270 
any flaws here and there as an anti
flaws<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.600> robot<00:03:49.260> mode<00:03:49.410> too<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.830> gotta<00:03:50.070> give

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
flaws and robot mode too I gotta give

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.020 
flaws and robot mode too I gotta give
this<00:03:50.430> figure<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.970> nine<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> half<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.920> time

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
this figure I nine and a half at a time

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
this figure I nine and a half at a time
the<00:03:54.030> only<00:03:54.330> thing<00:03:54.570> i<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:55.080> about<00:03:55.230> this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the only thing i don't like about this

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.130 
the only thing i don't like about this
figure<00:03:55.830> as<00:03:55.980> although<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:57.150> mode<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.510> movie

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
figure as although this mode is movie

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.530 
figure as although this mode is movie
accurate<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:59.130> basically<00:03:59.940> looked<00:04:00.269> like

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
accurate it basically looked like

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.570 
accurate it basically looked like
because<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.380> hair<00:04:01.590> doesn't<00:04:01.950> concealed<00:04:02.370> it

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
because the hair doesn't concealed it

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.520 
because the hair doesn't concealed it
basically<00:04:03.030> looks<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.450> Megatron's<00:04:04.050> just<00:04:04.320> put

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
basically looks like Megatron's just put

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
basically looks like Megatron's just put
his<00:04:04.650> two<00:04:04.830> legs<00:04:05.040> up<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:06.090> harm<00:04:06.360> drop<00:04:06.540> knee<00:04:06.690> or

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
his two legs up is to harm drop knee or

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.560 
his two legs up is to harm drop knee or
and<00:04:07.050> grow<00:04:07.290> grow<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.459> big<00:04:08.700> step<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.390> his

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
and grow grow this big step out of his

and grow grow this big step out of his
back<00:04:09.750> from<00:04:10.049> them<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:10.830> if<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.610> don't<00:04:11.790> think<00:04:11.940> of

back from them but if you don't think of
it<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.150> way<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:12.959> very<00:04:13.200> movie<00:04:13.650> accurate
