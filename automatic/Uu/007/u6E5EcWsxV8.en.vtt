00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.500
 the cordata son is one of the children who 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.150
 greater biodiversity is 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.599
 Fiocruz as animals found which is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.759
 the invertebrate bryan class which is a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.240
 animal of mouth circulate jaw 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.789
 shark a fish with ventral mouth 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 cartilaginous bone fish as 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.340
 represented by the atom 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.980
 the animals amphibians of transition meter 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.579
 to the water the reptiles the first raps 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.460
 with animals completely rest the birds 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 animals adapted for the flight and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.070
 mammals then there is a large 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.969
 biodiversity and it is up to the child to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.309
 son we belong to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.120
 let's now look at the characteristics 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:57.559
 general of the child agreed to the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.270
 rope is a word of Latin origin 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.989
 means rope as if it were in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.369
 Portuguese also rope and tie 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 characterized the people then the animals and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.549
 children are characterized by having 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.869
 a note a rope the note a rope is a stick 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.900
 of the salt that gives support to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.830
 muscles that support the body of the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.100
 animal 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.970
 this structure is present in all 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 edge individuals 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.720
 although those who look at most of these 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.689
 most of the animals and this date was 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.579
 structure exists in the embryonic stage 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.280
 how human being man keeps the rope note 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.240
 but only at the embryonic stage in the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.520
 adult 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.979
 the monsters and the body is supported by 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.409
 skeleton through the spine and not 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.119
 more by note the rope that is replaced 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.630
 the rope note does not give rise to a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.630
 skeleton is replaced by the skeleton 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.030
 another characteristic of the son 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 stored is the presence of a cord or 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.849
 voice of salt as we see here in this image 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.530
 keep nervous of the sun in the other children 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.740
 such as the edge of the troop 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.170
 This nervous cord is ventral and not 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.560
 salt only on the son rope the cord 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.630
 nervous is dorsal 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.670
 another feature that calls 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.100
 attention is the presence of white crevices 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.690
 all the animals of this son have 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.700
 worldwide sales 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.740
 some like the fish that crack 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.920
 persist these sales persist 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.020
 life in humans is to send 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.940
 bank ae only exist in the embryonic stage 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.040
 then it disappears and finally the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 presence of a syrup all animals 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.430
 the child wake up all the species are 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.500
 other caudates even a human being who 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.000
 we have because we have a tail in the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.370
 embryonic stage 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.880
 in adulthood this syrup comes down to 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.640
 three cycles called cox and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.010
 characterized therein and an inner syrup but 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.300
 in every way the tail is present in 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.790
 all species 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.960
 even who only in some only one 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.960
 stage of life 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.820
 usually the date ofcom represented 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.710
 by the wire that is an aquatic animal 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.820
 marine does not exist in our coast 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:29.510
 on the Brazilian coast means but he 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.740
 it is very well the era used to represent 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.400
 the son 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:38.930
 the rotated movie is subdivided into three sub 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.730
 children on children, it is agreed 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.630
 sub filo for awake and bone and iron 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.710
 everton and beat or also called 'the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.160
 chordata and the real you talk to 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:59.150
 date represented by the sane vioxx 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.140
 represented by animals is excess 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.690
 This is the fact that they do not 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.360
 first adult stage and the pleasures 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.640
 include all terrestrial animals and 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.390
 such as fish or terrestrial 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.390
 like mammal birds 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.880
 the century-old bank agreed or steel bugs 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:27.300
 hubfs usf1 is represented by the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:29.009
 Fiocruz is they are not marine animals 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.289
 As I said, it does not exist here in our 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.500
 mother of ours on the Brazilian coast are 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.050
 animals normally filtering water 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.550
 enters through the mouth and into the ies when 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.400
 the white foods are retained 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.620
 animals are eyes each of them ex 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.020
 separated from fertilization and external 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.800
 fecundation in the water the primates order and 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.900
 the eggs without lying in the water 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.810
 the development of this indirect animal 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.550
 through a lava how much it is washable 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.860
 indirect development 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.009
 It is believed that animals similar to 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.139
 fish that would have given birth to fish 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.509
 so it is important that we know the 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.419
 year some aspects of this animal's life 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.919
 because he is probably not part 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.780
 he plus one 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.130
 ours similar to him would have given 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.020
 origin to fish 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.110
 we also have the group will be addressed 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.270
 also called tony cable published 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.639
 76 animals in adulthood Sergio wants to 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.570
 to say fixed they are fixed to the substrate 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:35.400
 in the larval phase it has it's in the lid 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.919
 and established success in the embryonic phase of 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.180
 cyani plus the note may be restricted 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:45.840
 just to the caldas in the phase of the lavras 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.090
 hence the name agreed the place also gives 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.039
 Slicers are similarly when 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.699
 talk and playback also 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.699
 similar to leaving spoke up well 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.080
 here I miss this video lesson from 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.849
 characteristics of the agreed child 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.139
 and the next one taking class 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:06.139
 we will study the super classic is 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.139
 very low
