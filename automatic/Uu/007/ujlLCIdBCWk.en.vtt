the traditional var X systems x-force
have<00:02:52.880> created<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.240> really<00:02:53.450> good<00:02:53.720> system

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
have created this really good system

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.900 
have created this really good system
with<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> an<00:02:54.620> anti<00:02:54.920> drone<00:02:55.160> canister<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.820> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
with a an anti drone canister on the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.340 
with a an anti drone canister on the
side<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.660> don't<00:02:56.990> have<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.290> that

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
side so you don't have to have that

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.110 
side so you don't have to have that
adjustment<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.250> simply<00:02:58.520> have<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.760> canister

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
adjustment you simply have this canister

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.280 
adjustment you simply have this canister
