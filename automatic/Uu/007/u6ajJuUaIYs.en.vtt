played<00:04:57.670> d5<00:04:59.730> what<00:05:00.730> do<00:05:00.790> you<00:05:00.850> think<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.150> this<00:05:01.300> more

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
played d5 what do you think of this more

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.320 
played d5 what do you think of this more
is<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.820> good<00:05:04.090> Knight<00:05:04.660> takes<00:05:04.990> on<00:05:05.320> h5<00:05:06.330> many

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
is that good Knight takes on h5 many

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
is that good Knight takes on h5 many
times<00:05:07.630> it<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.530> not<00:05:09.100> very<00:05:09.430> good<00:05:09.520> idea<00:05:10.020> but<00:05:11.020> let's

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
times it is not very good idea but let's

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.700 
times it is not very good idea but let's
check<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:11.770> variation<00:05:13.110> rook<00:05:14.110> takes<00:05:14.320> pawn

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
check this variation rook takes pawn

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.540 
check this variation rook takes pawn
takes<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:16.060> now<00:05:16.630> Queen<00:05:17.050> can't<00:05:17.680> take<00:05:17.920> on<00:05:18.130> h5

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
takes and now Queen can't take on h5

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.160 
takes and now Queen can't take on h5
because<00:05:19.000> Knight<00:05:19.450> is<00:05:19.800> hanging<00:05:20.800> on<00:05:21.040> d4<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.690> night
