00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.169 

okay<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.170> frame<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:14.179> foundation

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
okay so this is a frame of foundation

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
okay so this is a frame of foundation
that's<00:00:15.630> been<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.320> colony<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:16.890> they've

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that's been in a colony and they've

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.849 
that's been in a colony and they've
started<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.640> draw<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:19.529> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
started to draw it out you can see that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.970 
started to draw it out you can see that
this<00:00:20.730> area<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.539> has<00:00:21.750> been<00:00:22.140> drawn<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.740> they

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this area here has been drawn out they

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.160 
this area here has been drawn out they
in<00:00:23.100> fact<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.000> put<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:24.930> bit<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
in fact up here they put a little bit of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.589 
in fact up here they put a little bit of
honey<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.880> drawing<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.330> all

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
honey in it so this is drawing out all

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.380 
honey in it so this is drawing out all
except<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.859> small<00:00:29.250> corner<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.970> you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
except for a very small corner here you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.780 
except for a very small corner here you
can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:31.529> nicely<00:00:31.800> they've<00:00:32.189> drawn<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.669> out

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
can see how nicely they've drawn it out

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
can see how nicely they've drawn it out
here<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:36.170> known<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.410> brace<00:00:37.770> comb

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
here is is what is known as brace comb

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.069 
here is is what is known as brace comb
it<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.670> continued<00:00:39.239> over<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> next

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it would be continued over to the next

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
it would be continued over to the next
comb<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:41.010> tie<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.579> combs

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
comb and then it would tie the two combs

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.630 
comb and then it would tie the two combs
together<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> great<00:00:44.250> for

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
together but this is this is great for

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
together but this is this is great for
bees<00:00:45.020> because<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> allows<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.280> walk<00:00:47.489> from

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
bees because it allows them to walk from

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
bees because it allows them to walk from
this<00:00:48.030> comb<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> other<00:00:48.780> comb<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.829> not

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this comb to the other comb but it's not

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
this comb to the other comb but it's not
great<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.640> beekeepers<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
great for beekeepers because then we

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.459 
great for beekeepers because then we
can't<00:00:52.680> pull<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.820> frames<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:55.199> bees

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
can't pull the frames out if your bees

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
can't pull the frames out if your bees
do<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.010> basically<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.570> do

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
do that basically what you want to do

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.139 
do that basically what you want to do
scrape<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.350> down<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> plastic<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
scrape that off down to the plastic and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.229 
scrape that off down to the plastic and
put<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> back<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.890> let<00:01:02.039> them<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.820> again

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
put it back in and let them do it again

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.289 
put it back in and let them do it again
okay<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.559> example<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.640> comb<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
okay this is an example of a comb that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.320 
okay this is an example of a comb that
we<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.260> most<00:01:07.860> likely<00:01:08.189> toss<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.939> it's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
we would most likely toss out it's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
we would most likely toss out it's
obviously<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.140> old<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.310> really

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
obviously very old because it's really

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
obviously very old because it's really
dark<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.689> sides<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> cells<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.490> getting

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
dark the sides of the cells are getting

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
dark the sides of the cells are getting
very<00:01:15.060> thick<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> comb<00:01:15.990> may<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.740> worth

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
very thick this comb may not be worth

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.249 
very thick this comb may not be worth
saving<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.180> whole<00:01:18.390> section<00:01:18.810> here

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
saving you have this whole section here

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.700 
saving you have this whole section here
that<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:20.189> also<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:20.880> entombed<00:01:21.330> pollen<00:01:21.900> way

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that is also some entombed pollen way

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.070 
that is also some entombed pollen way
down<00:01:22.950> into<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> black<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
down into that black so it's about the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.140 
down into that black so it's about the
cells<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.619> half<00:01:25.860> full<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.909> tell

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
cells about half full you can tell

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
cells about half full you can tell
compared<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.020> next<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.650> then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
compared to the one next to it and then

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.450 
compared to the one next to it and then
it<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.670> black<00:01:30.299> propolis<00:01:31.220> for<00:01:32.220> some

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it has that black propolis for some

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.240 
it has that black propolis for some
reason<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.119> bees<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:34.100> determined<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
reason the bees have determined that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
reason the bees have determined that
that's<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that's not good and they're not going to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.350 
that's not good and they're not going to
use<00:01:37.710> anymore<00:01:38.130> they<00:01:38.400> cover<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
use anymore they cover it up and that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
use anymore they cover it up and that
cell<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:39.900> never<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.350> opened<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.829> again<00:01:41.159> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
cell will never get opened up again so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200 
cell will never get opened up again so
you've<00:01:41.700> lost<00:01:42.649> about<00:01:43.649> ten<00:01:44.130> percent<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you've lost about ten percent of the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.080 
you've lost about ten percent of the
total<00:01:45.540> area<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.710> frame<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.640> some

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
total area so this frame has got some

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.300 
total area so this frame has got some
mold<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
mold on it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.800 
mold on it
so<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.759> where<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> bees<00:01:51.270> were<00:01:51.540> this

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
so you can see where the bees were this

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
so you can see where the bees were this
was<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> dieing<00:01:52.530> cluster<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.490> amount<00:01:53.850> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
was the dieing cluster at this amount of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.499 
was the dieing cluster at this amount of
mold<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.920> these<00:01:55.920> dead<00:01:56.219> bees<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.299> bees

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
mold and these dead bees that the bees

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
mold and these dead bees that the bees
would<00:01:57.719> clean<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> reuse<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.219> with

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
would clean this out and reuse it with

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
would clean this out and reuse it with
no<00:01:59.579> problem<00:02:00.060> whatsoever<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.530> put<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
no problem whatsoever if you put this in

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
no problem whatsoever if you put this in
and<00:02:02.399> came<00:02:02.670> back<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.149> next<00:02:03.390> day<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.869> looked<00:02:04.229> at

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and came back the next day and looked at

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
and came back the next day and looked at
it<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.219> bees<00:02:05.430> would<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.000> cleaned

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it the bees would have it all cleaned

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.619 
it the bees would have it all cleaned
out<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> probably<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.560> using<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:09.030> kind

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
out and probably be using it this kind

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.950 
out and probably be using it this kind
of<00:02:09.720> powdery<00:02:10.200> stuff<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.310> there

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
of powdery stuff you see on there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.710 
of powdery stuff you see on there
that<00:02:12.470> that's<00:02:13.010> probably<00:02:13.520> from<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.940> box<00:02:14.210> above

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
that that's probably from the box above

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.740 
that that's probably from the box above
that<00:02:14.990> had<00:02:15.230> some<00:02:16.030> pollen<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.480> breaking

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
that had some pollen that was breaking

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.600 
that had some pollen that was breaking
down<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.560> wouldn't<00:02:18.950> be<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> concern

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
down and that wouldn't be a concern

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.480 
down and that wouldn't be a concern
either<00:02:20.320> we're<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.500> gonna<00:02:21.650> open<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:22.220> call

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
either we're just gonna open this call

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.450 
either we're just gonna open this call

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.449 

there's<00:02:57.390> drone<00:02:57.749> brood<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.439> frame<00:02:58.709> we

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
there's drone brood on this frame we

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.050 
there's drone brood on this frame we
don't<00:02:59.670> normally<00:02:59.879> reject<00:03:01.340> frame<00:03:02.340> for<00:03:02.730> having

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
don't normally reject frame for having

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.989 
don't normally reject frame for having
drone<00:03:03.299> brood<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.739> some<00:03:05.519> drones<00:03:05.819> in

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:05.999 
drone brood we think that some drones in

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.119 
drone brood we think that some drones in
the<00:03:06.120> colony<00:03:06.480> are<00:03:06.599> good<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.349> can<00:03:07.530> tell<00:03:07.680> drone

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
the colony are good you can tell drone

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.420 
the colony are good you can tell drone
from<00:03:08.430> worker<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.989> they<00:03:10.049> have<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:10.430> stockier

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
from worker that they have a stockier

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.059 
from worker that they have a stockier
body<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:12.689> one's<00:03:12.930> quite<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.290> bit<00:03:13.500> bigger<00:03:13.739> but

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
body this one's quite a bit bigger but

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.179 
body this one's quite a bit bigger but
the<00:03:15.060> biggest<00:03:15.239> thing<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.840> eyes<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.980> eyes

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
the biggest thing is the eyes the eyes

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.970 
the biggest thing is the eyes the eyes
cover<00:03:17.700> almost<00:03:18.329> their<00:03:18.510> entire<00:03:18.540> face<00:03:19.260> this

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
cover almost their entire face this

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.399 
cover almost their entire face this
section<00:03:20.609> right<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:21.629> they're

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
section right here you can see they're

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.009 
section right here you can see they're
not<00:03:22.560> using<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.219> section<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.060> lower<00:03:24.419> and<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
not using this section it's lower and it

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.199 
not using this section it's lower and it
walls<00:03:25.379> are<00:03:25.590> thicker<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.189> they're<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.999> not

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
walls are thicker and they're just not

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.420 
walls are thicker and they're just not
using<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.260> whenever<00:03:28.439> a<00:03:28.680> frame<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.219> down

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
using it so whenever a frame is down

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.050 
using it so whenever a frame is down
where<00:03:30.030> they're<00:03:30.510> not<00:03:30.719> using<00:03:31.319> 10%<00:03:32.010> or<00:03:32.639> more<00:03:32.669> of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
where they're not using 10% or more of

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.970 
where they're not using 10% or more of
it<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.450> really<00:03:34.019> should<00:03:34.049> get<00:03:34.500> rid<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.859> it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
it you really should get rid of it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.250 
it you really should get rid of it
because<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.730> lot<00:03:35.909> of<00:03:35.969> brood<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:36.629> they

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
because that's a lot of brood that they

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.129 
because that's a lot of brood that they
can't<00:03:37.560> raise<00:03:38.329> we<00:03:39.329> wouldn't<00:03:39.599> go<00:03:39.719> in<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.989> take

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
can't raise we wouldn't go in and take

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.170 
can't raise we wouldn't go in and take
it<00:03:40.290> out<00:03:40.439> now<00:03:40.680> but<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.219> would<00:03:41.400> take<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:41.819> this

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
it out now but we would take it out this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.120 
it out now but we would take it out this
fall<00:03:43.099> after<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.430> season's<00:03:44.969> over
