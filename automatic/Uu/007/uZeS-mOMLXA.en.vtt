00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.390
 all right 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.789
 ah 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.789
 ah 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.720
 in the world of sports because for me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.800
 father who has always done humanities and 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.870
 he always liked training 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.560
 do it at the beginning not very small and I 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.880
 I point in taekwondo and then the 13 and 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.880
 They decided to change one round and then 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.920
 not so 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.900
 consists of the afternoon 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.780
 then we do shade we lie down to the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.480
 pumps then we make payments the bodies to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
 bodies and then push-ups exercises 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.010
 sit-ups and all that and then the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 difference as the fight because we have 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 in the mornings you also listen 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.780
 physical much running and in the afternoon then 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.700
 more payments more spaces 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.530
 is the difference with the plant 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 combat morning and afternoon but for the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.479
 late just to follow the form 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.960
 well my coach right now in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.960
 thailand 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.110
 and he next to another one who is in the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.830
 our gym, they are 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.830
 training now 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.940
 therefore very important 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.640
 wrestlers training the background 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 physical for combat and physical background 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 From the half 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.810
 50 the combat 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.729
 is chosen dead is because I think 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.110
 I started kickboxing each one and I 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.780
 It changed very tall because I saw it was 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.570
 a sport that you use most co2 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 melee knee and the truth that 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.910
 has a lot more technique is different 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.760
 my combat approach then 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.710
 first he looked at who is the fighter and the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.060
 future videos 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.900
 he tried to study it a little to know 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.670
 how it's going to come out can always change and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.000
 trains a lot physically very strong and 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.450
 always look at a lot of filial is ideal 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.950
 Clio some new technique that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.800
 then to try to do it with the reverse 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.160
 physical background is the most important thing that 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.690
 I was almost everyone in my corner 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.030
 here in tenerife for example when 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.069
 I fight if my father is always 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.220
 frank and also that match makes me 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.960
 my bed of a roman friend also the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.300
 gives 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.560
 more the corner very well and then 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.900
 Interland could already are the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.160
 Thai and also if it matches that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.620
 is in my father or some also help 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.960
 or some custom like that or some amulet 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.080
 before the fight I knew I always have 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.170
 two or three boxers that are comfortable not only 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.180
 put and then also the bandage on 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.650
 molds when plastics a room 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.720
 the mold and if won and it has brought me 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.640
 luck so I keep using it until 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.530
 it can 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.210
 for the peeling that in the Canary Islands 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.420
 Of course I then fought on campus 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.420
 of Spain in Madrid and Thailand 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.250
 in tournament to toyota in hong kong also 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.110
 plan interface 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.960
 World Amateurs also fight in 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.580
 banks 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.180
 for thailand has been we move the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.180
 king's birthday 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.939
 and then now they are leaving me 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.500
 they have called to fight outside of 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.130
 thailand and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.860
 to the truth then to someone that I like 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.630
 the Thai money fighter with 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.630
 a lot is clear one of them 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.610
 clay 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.610
 what 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.890
 and sometimes both foreign and then 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 like us, if it's always ramÃ³n 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.390
 to see a story and is a boy is 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.010
 an antoine brother and then be boxing 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.920
 in thailand and also 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.950
 I think right now 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.880
 Well, a bad moment in my career 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.120
 of voceador because he was 15 years older or 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.980
 minus 16 the first ones that I lost I had 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.690
 won one amassed exhibition in the 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.070
 converters with that title that has been 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.640
 said to cry and everything was done 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.680
 and then good then for example now 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.930
 expressed earlier than with the light 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.840
 after so much time always ar here 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.490
 the people who do not know me much but if 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.440
 outside and that and he could show people 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.440
 I'm training 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.700
 and happy of the water livestock with water 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.920
 rival 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.150
 the truth that this sport does not give me either 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.730
 enough money to live with the 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.010
 sport and other things because I'm pulling 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.440
 I would like him to sink to live and 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.200
 I was left over, it's clear but little 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.710
 a little to see if you can was intended 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.180
 is to continue training fighting to the fullest and 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.340
 to become champion like everyone 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.470
 wants not only a federation but 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.780
 of several and you can several weights and 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.590
 up of several categories as it would be 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.440
 It was the greatest 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.520
 that the level in the Canary Islands is very high 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.410
 Spain and everything we always carry gold 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.200
 We are always the group champions and 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.580
 everything and I think yes I think that the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.550
 future here in the Canaries is that they 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.220
 can leave in europe up 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.020
 Well, the truth is that there are several fighters 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.020
 they have level so read your 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.069
 like kenny 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.699
 the imac of madrid pretty is but I 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.949
 I sincerely believe that I do not know how I like 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.259
 more my style than others because 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.629
 give a greeting to all my people who are 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.780
 in tenerife is and dina spain in all 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.780
 sides 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.030
 that we are left sight and sting 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.180
 Thailand but class and stressing hard 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.800
 and that to return here to give him to give him cane 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.610
