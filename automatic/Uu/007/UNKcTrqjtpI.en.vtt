00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.540

 then they guided me and ran another thousand 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.409
 kilometers for them to check the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.390
 consumption and how it is here 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.470
 every time the car enters the level of 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 Low oil 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.209

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.599
 ten in ten thousand 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.569
 if you turn it and run 10 thousand km that it 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.890
 consumed every thousand miles 200 ml 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.049

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.260

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.590

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.420

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.060
