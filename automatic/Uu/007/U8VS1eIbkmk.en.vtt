00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:47.370
 nobody's very life i'm not me sometimes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.449
 I demand that here are the guys here if i 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.550
 I know something and move something at least 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 if you do not know and if you disturb me 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.559
 you'll see nothing more 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.769
 and there are people who think that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.199
 they know and think that they do not interfere here 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.600
 with these people I would fight 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.820
 we get nothing is important just not to me 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.770
 interfered with all the idiots who once 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.469
 whitens either blackens or think that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.760
 they know and generally like one of my 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.340
 core thoughts 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.090
 it is wide and that is simpler and not all of that 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.120
 what sticks out of water this one for today 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.540
 day is such a belief but if today with 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.050
 I will give you today so well 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.890
 further it will change or 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.100
 I do not know what the past is 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.640
 this past we analyzed it from and 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.830
 and today woke up today 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.460
 it is better to live for today and not to live 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.800
 the future 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 it is also not very healthy you can 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.270
 be deceived at any moment any second 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.980
 something or something happens that you are not 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.590
 expected and can stay in the cold 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.670
 something to imagine and they tell you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.340
 about for a fool, and you do not need me, I 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.010
 today's biologist confuse me 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.670
 difficult Alexey for you creativity this 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.780
 stream of consciousness or all the same technique 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.070
 reason but here it is necessary to seek a motive 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.560
 how could she in another case if you 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.020
 want to get to the truth and not just 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 on sensations to understand or not to understand 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.700
 but to get to the truth is needed 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 mother motive here let's go my motive in 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.480
 writing the text for example yes he he 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.520
 more concerned with analyzing what's happening i 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.209
 would like to pro she analyze around 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.090
 yourself something and yourself in this something and everything 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.820
 it 's a bit more complicated to describe 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.760
 music i can't analyze and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.800
 I make it just write a poetry for 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.050
 you she should be what she should 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.530
 be truthful if we want to collect 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.430
 then we we die motive look for what 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.020
 spent I do not know I'm writing for granted 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.000
 truthfully it is not true who decide not 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.400
 I understand I am writing for granted I try 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.920
 reach out in her business by her department 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.920
 not easy is called rockenrol where there is 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.870
 the bottom is the height exactly this here 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.209
 the difference in between gives me the opportunity 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.489
 analysis and so I try 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.280
 and I want to do a given nature under 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:27.830
 the name of the truth is I brush and do not 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.500
 yes very well that's what this is 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.580
 one of those poets who wrote like 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.760
 felt like you thought it close i 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.980
 Again you do not understand a cliche put 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.290
 one of those poets who thought 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.760
 felt you understand all poets think 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.110
 and everyone feels 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.239
 none and fierce this thing is 5 i 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.560
 I will return you all the time in the topic that 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.590
 I found it with my money 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:03.769
 followers he was my friend as well as 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:07.390
 let's say Anna Akhmatova friend of our hands 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.350
 singers here do what i do 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.690
 analyzed your life 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.200
 life path myself I understood 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.229
 that he is not close here and all here you are now 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.209

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.889
