00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 There are a lot of questions and the main 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.420
 way about preparing a competition here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.140
 By the way, everything is already in full swing. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.140
 per day and perrin 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.440

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.390
 a huge stir for more than a month Alena 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.489

 Romania in Moldova in Turkey at the 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 the moment I sang sentences from Greece 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 England did not leave alens alone and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.350
 photojournalists like there will be a photo 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.479
 first questions of course about the new 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.940
 the song in salt was written by two European 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.770
 author mark poyling and martin keen who 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.430
 not the first year of writing hits for 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.820
 the stars 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.960
 Eurovision decided that it would probably be 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.729
 honestly if we just get together our 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.300
 an artist council consisting of pairs 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.930

 the number of votes was 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.630
 determined that the song is salt long-awaited 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.340
 presented without too much pathos as 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 only Turkish directors expelled him 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.820
