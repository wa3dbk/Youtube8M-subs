00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
think well not PC but a Mac Apple Mac

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.440 
think well not PC but a Mac Apple Mac
and<00:01:25.130> I'm<00:01:25.430> not<00:01:25.700> really<00:01:25.880> sure<00:01:26.000> what<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:26.390> is

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
and I'm not really sure what this is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.490 
and I'm not really sure what this is
supposed<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.990> be<00:01:27.079> but<00:01:28.270> well<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.539> am<00:01:29.960> assuming

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
supposed to be but well I am assuming

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.770 
supposed to be but well I am assuming
it's<00:01:31.009> some<00:01:31.399> sort<00:01:31.640> of<00:01:31.729> hard<00:01:32.060> drive<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:32.630> it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's some sort of hard drive but it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.010 
it's some sort of hard drive but it
would<00:01:33.469> be<00:01:33.649> pretty<00:01:34.100> weird<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.579> have<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:35.780> kind

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
would be pretty weird to have that kind

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.959 
would be pretty weird to have that kind
of<00:01:36.049> hard<00:01:36.320> drive<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.649> plug<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.549> a<00:01:37.579> Mac

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
of hard drive and plug it to a Mac

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.550 
of hard drive and plug it to a Mac
anyway<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.659> doesn't<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:38.960> matter<00:01:39.140> well

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
anyway it doesn't really matter well

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.889 
anyway it doesn't really matter well
like<00:01:40.189> I<00:01:40.219> said<00:01:40.369> before<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.850> amazing<00:01:41.509> map<00:01:41.689> and
