00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
it's definitely water Lee look at that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.059 
it's definitely water Lee look at that
it's<00:03:59.790> like<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> whole<00:04:00.239> scrubbing<00:04:03.799> show<00:04:04.799> at<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
it's like a whole scrubbing show at the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.900 
it's like a whole scrubbing show at the
jump<00:04:05.310> cut<00:04:06.470> but<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.980> strawberry<00:04:08.400> did

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
jump cut but that strawberry did

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.129 
jump cut but that strawberry did
actually<00:04:09.269> cut<00:04:09.510> really<00:04:09.780> well<00:04:11.000> but<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
actually cut really well but like the

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.680 
actually cut really well but like the
pulp<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.530> really<00:04:14.010> hard<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.280> clean<00:04:14.579> so<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.269> would

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
pulp is really hard to clean so I would

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.270 
pulp is really hard to clean so I would
recommend<00:04:15.840> putting<00:04:16.590> um<00:04:17.479> like<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:20.250> know

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
recommend putting um like a you know

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.690 
recommend putting um like a you know
probably<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:21.380> like<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> bag<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:23.099> there<00:04:23.280> or

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
probably a like a bag in there or

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.760 
probably a like a bag in there or
something<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.599> catch<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.200> pulp

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
something to catch the pulp
