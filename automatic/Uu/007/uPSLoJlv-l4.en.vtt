else I mean once you install that you're

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.709 
else I mean once you install that you're
all<00:02:34.329> done<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:35.859> that's<00:02:36.250> all<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.579> need<00:02:36.879> I

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719

can't<00:02:38.169> show<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.409> because<00:02:38.469> I<00:02:38.709> might<00:02:39.069> lose<00:02:39.219> my

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
can't show you because I might lose my

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.849 
can't show you because I might lose my
audio<00:02:39.790> here<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.780> might<00:02:41.349> show<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.769> the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
audio here so I might show you in the

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.179 
audio here so I might show you in the
end<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.999> you<00:02:43.329> know<00:02:43.450> we're<00:02:43.599> all<00:02:43.749> done<00:02:43.930> here

so<00:02:45.189> yeah<00:02:45.340> once<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.639> install<00:02:45.819> that<00:02:45.939> we<00:02:46.150> start<00:02:46.359> a

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
so yeah once you install that we start a

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.229 
so yeah once you install that we start a
springboard<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.959> you're<00:02:47.109> all<00:02:47.260> good<00:02:47.669> and<00:02:48.669> yeah

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
springboard and you're all good and yeah

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.089 
springboard and you're all good and yeah
if<00:02:49.359> you<00:02:49.450> activate<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.319> it's<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.980> like

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
if you activate this like it's just like

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.439 
if you activate this like it's just like
the<00:02:51.219> pc<00:02:51.489> version<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.819> double<00:02:52.030> tap<00:02:52.150> forward

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:52.449 
the pc version you double tap forward

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.050 
the pc version you double tap forward
just<00:02:53.079> like<00:02:53.199> that<00:02:53.349> just<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.939> you

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
just like that just like that and you

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.699 
just like that just like that and you
won't<00:02:55.209> get<00:02:55.359> the<00:02:55.480> glitching<00:02:56.019> on<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.199> pc<00:02:56.500> glitch

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
won't get the glitching on the pc glitch

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.970 
won't get the glitching on the pc glitch
for<00:02:56.859> it<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.219> like<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:59.230> terrible<00:02:59.769> so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
for it it's like this that's terrible so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.559 
for it it's like this that's terrible so
yeah<00:03:00.219> you<00:03:00.280> won't<00:03:00.459> get<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.879> it's<00:03:01.209> rude<00:03:01.389> oh

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
yeah you won't get that it's rude oh

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.259 
yeah you won't get that it's rude oh
it's<00:03:02.379> really<00:03:02.680> cool<00:03:02.829> I'm<00:03:03.069> not<00:03:03.219> sure<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.879> you<00:03:04.060> go

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
it's really cool I'm not sure if you go

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.569 
it's really cool I'm not sure if you go
side<00:03:04.569> against<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.169> wall<00:03:05.349> I'm<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.799> happens

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
side against a wall I'm a happens

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.970 
side against a wall I'm a happens
but<00:03:06.939> what<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.569> glitch<00:03:08.319> I've<00:03:08.500> found<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.919> that

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
but what one glitch I've found is that

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.129 
but what one glitch I've found is that
you<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.430> actually<00:03:09.549> pull<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.120> bow<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.510> run<00:03:10.989> at

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
you can actually pull a bow and run at

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.839 
you can actually pull a bow and run at
the<00:03:11.169> same<00:03:11.260> time<00:03:11.560> look<00:03:11.769> at<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:11.949> now<00:03:12.639> you<00:03:12.699> can

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
the same time look at that now you can

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.479 
the same time look at that now you can
run<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.389> normal<00:03:13.900> speed<00:03:14.199> with<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.379> bull<00:03:14.709> with<00:03:15.459> a

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
run a normal speed with a bull with a

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.629 
run a normal speed with a bull with a
bow<00:03:15.730> told<00:03:16.239> which<00:03:16.629> is<00:03:16.780> pretty<00:03:17.019> cool<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:18.519> also

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
bow told which is pretty cool and also

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.379 
bow told which is pretty cool and also
you<00:03:18.819> can<00:03:19.000> fly<00:03:19.479> and<00:03:19.750> go<00:03:20.590> faster<00:03:20.949> like<00:03:21.099> this<00:03:21.389> it's

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
you can fly and go faster like this it's

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.059 
you can fly and go faster like this it's
pretty<00:03:22.569> cool<00:03:22.689> it's<00:03:22.900> better<00:03:23.530> than<00:03:23.680> your<00:03:23.859> normal

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
pretty cool it's better than your normal

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.149 
pretty cool it's better than your normal
flying<00:03:24.489> speed<00:03:24.759> which<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.799> I'm<00:03:26.799> not<00:03:26.979> sure

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
flying speed which is that I'm not sure

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.219 
flying speed which is that I'm not sure
the<00:03:27.310> ratio<00:03:27.849> of<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.209> sprinting<00:03:28.689> speed<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.989> think

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229 
the ratio of the sprinting speed I think

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.589 
the ratio of the sprinting speed I think
it's<00:03:29.349> two<00:03:29.500> times<00:03:29.799> your<00:03:30.549> normal<00:03:30.970> walk<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.479> see

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
it's two times your normal walk and see

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.390 
it's two times your normal walk and see
I'm<00:03:31.750> not<00:03:31.870> sure<00:03:32.079> though<00:03:32.259> and<00:03:32.439> you<00:03:33.009> can<00:03:33.129> do<00:03:33.250> no

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
I'm not sure though and you can do no

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.059 
I'm not sure though and you can do no
parkour<00:03:33.909> jumps<00:03:34.329> like<00:03:34.449> I<00:03:34.689> am<00:03:34.959> doing<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.439> this

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
parkour jumps like I am doing and this

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.800 
parkour jumps like I am doing and this
is<00:03:36.220> really<00:03:36.729> cool<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.359> is<00:03:37.509> just<00:03:37.599> low

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
is really cool and this is just low

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.099
