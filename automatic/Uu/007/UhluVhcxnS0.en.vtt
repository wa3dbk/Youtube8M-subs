there<00:01:03.050> kind<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:03.769> know<00:01:03.890> but<00:01:04.460> there's

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
there kind of you know but there's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.430 
there kind of you know but there's
another<00:01:05.030> mentality<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:05.960> win<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.320> then

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
another mentality we can win it and then

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.020 
another mentality we can win it and then
he<00:01:06.500> was<00:01:06.590> only<00:01:06.800> what<00:01:06.950> six<00:01:07.220> three<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:07.820> they

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
he was only what six three so they

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.910 
he was only what six three so they
easily<00:01:08.360> could<00:01:08.600> have<00:01:08.720> come<00:01:08.840> back<00:01:08.870> but<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.770> just

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
easily could have come back but it just

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.680 
easily could have come back but it just
wasn't<00:01:10.250> happening<00:01:10.310> they<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:10.880> yeah<00:01:11.090> Island
