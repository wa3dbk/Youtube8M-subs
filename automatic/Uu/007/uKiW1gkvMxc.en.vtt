online I'll tell you they can
see<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.500> lot<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.750> protein<00:02:09.750> powder

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
see it's a lot like a protein powder

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.490 
see it's a lot like a protein powder
what's<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.300> interesting<00:02:12.840> about<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
what's really interesting about this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.449 
what's really interesting about this
though<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.879> tastes<00:02:15.560> good<00:02:16.620> when<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.099> eat<00:02:17.129> it

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
though is it tastes good when you eat it

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.699 
though is it tastes good when you eat it
like<00:02:18.120> right<00:02:18.360> out<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.959> literally

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
like right out of here it literally

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.850 
like right out of here it literally
tastes<00:02:19.950> pretty<00:02:20.099> darn<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.519> but<00:02:21.530> when<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.650> mix

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
tastes pretty darn good but when you mix

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.040 
tastes pretty darn good but when you mix
it<00:02:23.099> with<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.730> bunch<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.390> water<00:02:24.569> you're<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.930> in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
it with a bunch of water you're like in

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.199 
it with a bunch of water you're like in
a<00:02:25.080> water<00:02:25.319> bottle<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.790> doesn't<00:02:26.819> taste<00:02:27.120> that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
a water bottle it doesn't taste that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.210 
a water bottle it doesn't taste that
good<00:02:27.349> so<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:28.500> kind<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.709> weird<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
good so it's kind of weird that it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
good so it's kind of weird that it
tastes<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:29.790> coming<00:02:30.090> out<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:31.019> when

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
tastes really good coming out but when

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
tastes really good coming out but when
you<00:02:31.260> mix<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.739> kind<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.040> kind<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.459> diluted

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you mix it it's kind of kind of diluted

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.820 
you mix it it's kind of kind of diluted
I've<00:02:33.540> actually<00:02:33.780> even<00:02:34.080> taken<00:02:34.440> some<00:02:34.590> branch

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
I've actually even taken some branch

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.920 
I've actually even taken some branch
chains<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.819> taste<00:02:36.060> good<00:02:36.239> kind<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> mix<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.840> up

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
chains that taste good kind of mix it up

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.620 
chains that taste good kind of mix it up
in<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.049> water<00:02:37.290> bottle<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:39.450> other

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
in a water bottle with this the other

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.940 
in a water bottle with this the other
thing<00:02:39.720> that's<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.170> bit<00:02:40.500> weird<00:02:40.650> about

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
thing that's a little bit weird about

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.509 
thing that's a little bit weird about
this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:42.080> they<00:02:43.080> say<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.410> have<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.950> take<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
this is they say you have to take it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.910 
this is they say you have to take it
there's<00:02:45.269> no<00:02:45.420> real<00:02:45.660> dosing<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.410> when<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.709> take

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
there's no real dosing on when to take

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.339 
there's no real dosing on when to take
it<00:02:47.099> like<00:02:47.430> best<00:02:47.849> timing<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:48.810> say<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.140> best

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
it like best timing they say the best

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.350 
it like best timing they say the best
they<00:02:50.069> say<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.730> should<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.150> start

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
they say what you should do is start

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.720 
they say what you should do is start
taking<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.049> then<00:02:52.650> take<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.340> about<00:02:53.519> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
taking it and then take it about the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.870 
taking it and then take it about the
same<00:02:53.940> time<00:02:54.329> every<00:02:55.049> day<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:56.250> wake<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
same time every day so I wake up and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.160 
same time every day so I wake up and
it's<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.299> first<00:02:57.480> things<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.959> take

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
it's one of the first things that I take

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.300 
it's one of the first things that I take
in<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.250> morning<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:01.380> stay<00:03:01.650> consistent<00:03:01.860> with

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
in the morning to stay consistent with

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.729 
in the morning to stay consistent with
it<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:03.269> work<00:03:03.840> out<00:03:04.079> in<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> afternoon<00:03:04.349> they

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
it I work out in the afternoon they

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.140 
it I work out in the afternoon they
think<00:03:05.010> basically<00:03:05.190> say<00:03:05.579> you<00:03:05.610> want<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:05.880> work<00:03:05.940> out

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
think basically say you want to work out

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.240 
think basically say you want to work out
hours<00:03:06.630> later<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> stuff<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.040> your

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
hours later so the stuff is in your

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.280 
hours later so the stuff is in your
system<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.670> actually<00:03:08.819> kicking<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
system and actually kicking in I like to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.960 
system and actually kicking in I like to
work<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.739> afternoon<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.609> take<00:03:11.790> it

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
work on the afternoon so if I take it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.000 
work on the afternoon so if I take it
around<00:03:12.540> 8:00<00:03:12.690> or<00:03:12.810> 9:00<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.049> morning<00:03:13.470> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
around 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.280 
around 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning that
seems<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.519> about<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.540> best<00:03:15.750> timing<00:03:15.989> on<00:03:16.260> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
seems to be about the best timing on it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.240 
seems to be about the best timing on it
so<00:03:17.720> results<00:03:18.720> are<00:03:18.810> still<00:03:19.049> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.440> out<00:03:19.950> there

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
so results are still kind of out there

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.340 
so results are still kind of out there
