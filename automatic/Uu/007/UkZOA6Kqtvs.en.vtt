00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.290

 punctually 17 in the pampa between one and two in Mendoza and in the rest of the country 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.830
 practically 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 It did not rain at all, that's why I said at the beginning 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.710
 that the rains are behaving very badly in January this last 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.670
 mendel winter 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.069
 in the Argentine Republic especially in Patagonia 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.160
 it rained as always quite poor but between 5 between one and five thousand dollars 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.180
 general, there were some major rains in the mountain range but with snowfall if that did not 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.049
 it means nothing that the hours 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.870
 plainly 4 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.230
 and five millimeters almost in general were southeast wind drizzle 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.879
 We believe that it will continue like this 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.039
 is going to normalize from 100 in early spring and can be 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.929
 we said before too 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.989
 that spring rains 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.979
 be at least 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:43.899
 normal because because the event of the girl we said was gone 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.789
 totally this gives us hope 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:48.940
 that the rains 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.940
 be a bit older in the beginning 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.089

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.289
