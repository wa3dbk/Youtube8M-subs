of<00:00:14.759> people<00:00:14.940> are<00:00:15.420> under<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> impression<00:00:15.900> that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
of people are under the impression that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.040 
of people are under the impression that
aluminum<00:00:16.680> drive<00:00:16.890> shafts<00:00:17.840> give<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.900> more

aluminum drive shafts give you more

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.109 
aluminum drive shafts give you more
power<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.369> know<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> candle<00:00:21.060> out

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
power and you know the candle out

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.740 
power and you know the candle out
horsepower<00:00:21.689> or<00:00:22.470> yes<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> no<00:00:23.240> this<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.420> stock

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
horsepower or yes and no this is a stock

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.279 
horsepower or yes and no this is a stock
one<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.430> stock<00:00:26.430> aluminum<00:00:26.820> driveshaft<00:00:27.289> it's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
one a stock aluminum driveshaft it's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.929 
one a stock aluminum driveshaft it's
thinner<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> weaker<00:00:29.220> than<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> performance

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
thinner and weaker than the performance

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.930 
thinner and weaker than the performance
ones<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.399> hand<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.700> lot<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
ones so this one hand a lot of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.819 
ones so this one hand a lot of
horsepower<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.450> all

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
horsepower at all

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.100 
horsepower at all
so<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.980> careful<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.930> would<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so be careful with that and would you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.450 
so be careful with that and would you
stop<00:00:37.170> putting<00:00:37.440> slicks<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> car<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
stop putting slicks on a car and it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.459 
stop putting slicks on a car and it
grabs<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> will<00:00:40.110> twist<00:00:40.350> up

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
grabs you know that this will twist up

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.729 
grabs you know that this will twist up
like<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> pretzel<00:00:42.860> aluminum<00:00:43.860> also<00:00:44.360> has<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.660

what<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.879> talking<00:01:03.000> about<00:01:03.420> oh<00:01:03.449> yeah<00:01:03.629> by

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
what was I talking about oh yeah by

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.230 
what was I talking about oh yeah by
shaft<00:01:05.150> all<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:07.670> now<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> go<00:01:09.000> higher

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
shaft all right now if you go higher

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.050 
shaft all right now if you go higher
horsepower<00:01:09.540> well<00:01:10.380> saying<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.790> have

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
horsepower well saying was these have

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
horsepower well saying was these have
these<00:01:12.630> reach<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> critical<00:01:13.350> speed<00:01:15.740> much

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
these reach the critical speed much

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.630 
these reach the critical speed much
faster<00:01:17.659> which<00:01:18.659> means<00:01:18.990> uh<00:01:19.549> they're<00:01:20.549> gonna

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
faster which means uh they're gonna

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
faster which means uh they're gonna
start<00:01:20.850> vibrating<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.650> break<00:01:22.650> quicker<00:01:24.290> that's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
start vibrating and break quicker that's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.130 
start vibrating and break quicker that's
why<00:01:25.470> sometimes<00:01:25.680> these<00:01:25.979> vibrate<00:01:26.430> soon<00:01:26.909> um<00:01:27.150> let

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
why sometimes these vibrate soon um let

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.030 
why sometimes these vibrate soon um let
you<00:01:28.229> hear<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> people<00:01:28.829> saying<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you hear a lot of people saying that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
you hear a lot of people saying that
drive<00:01:29.369> shafts<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> Loom<00:01:30.090> drive<00:01:30.270> chef's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
drive shafts the Loom drive chef's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.350 
drive shafts the Loom drive chef's
vibrate<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.220> when<00:01:32.220> they're<00:01:32.340> driving<00:01:32.520> that's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
vibrate look when they're driving that's

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
vibrate look when they're driving that's
because<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.720> reach<00:01:34.110> their<00:01:34.290> vibrational

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
because they reach their vibrational

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
because they reach their vibrational
frequency<00:01:35.640> much<00:01:35.850> sooner<00:01:36.350> their<00:01:37.350> natural

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
frequency much sooner their natural

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.969 
frequency much sooner their natural
frequency<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
frequency all right now if you go to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.090 
frequency all right now if you go to
after<00:01:41.790> mark<00:01:42.150> aluminum<00:01:42.509> driveshaft<00:01:42.950> they<00:01:43.950> are

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
after mark aluminum driveshaft they are

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
after mark aluminum driveshaft they are
much<00:01:44.310> thicker<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.110> have

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
much thicker and have you know they have

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
much thicker and have you know they have
their<00:01:49.560> own<00:01:49.590> problems<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.729> they

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
their own problems because then they

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
their own problems because then they
don't<00:01:51.240> clear<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:52.350> driveshaft<00:01:52.829> loops<00:01:53.070> like

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
don't clear your driveshaft loops like

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370 
don't clear your driveshaft loops like
this<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.729> didn't<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> had<00:01:54.840> another<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
this one didn't and I had another one it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
this one didn't and I had another one it
was<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:55.950> three<00:01:56.340> three<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.000> half

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
was I like about three three and a half

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
was I like about three three and a half
I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.930> three<00:01:58.110> inch<00:01:58.200> driveshaft<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.009> is

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I think three inch driveshaft this is

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.499 
I think three inch driveshaft this is
about<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.670> would<00:02:00.000> say<00:02:00.180> maybe<00:02:00.990> two<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> half

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
about I would say maybe two and a half

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.770 
about I would say maybe two and a half
that<00:02:03.509> also<00:02:03.840> rubbed<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.229> my<00:02:04.409> loop<00:02:05.329> now<00:02:06.329> you're

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that also rubbed on my loop now you're

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.999 
that also rubbed on my loop now you're
asking<00:02:07.110> me<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> know<00:02:07.860> why

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
asking me if you want to know why

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
asking me if you want to know why
there's<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> loop<00:02:08.670> why<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> loop

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
there's a loop why you would have a loop

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.839 
there's a loop why you would have a loop
around<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.640> it's

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
around these things because if it's

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
around these things because if it's
brakes

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
brakes

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.990 
brakes
and<00:02:13.110> say<00:02:13.290> bricks<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> front<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.880> go

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000

the back in any case like I said if you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.680 
the back in any case like I said if you
go<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:38.150> high-performance<00:02:39.150> driveshaft

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
go to a high-performance driveshaft

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.510 
go to a high-performance driveshaft
aluminum<00:02:40.080> they<00:02:40.290> become<00:02:40.590> much<00:02:40.770> thicker<00:02:43.520> now

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
aluminum they become much thicker now

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.550 
aluminum they become much thicker now
the<00:02:45.150> best<00:02:45.390> driveshaft<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.990> could<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the best driveshaft you could get is a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.110 
the best driveshaft you could get is a
carbon<00:02:47.070> fiber<00:02:47.310> driveshaft

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
carbon fiber driveshaft

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.680 
carbon fiber driveshaft
they<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.990> higher<00:02:49.140> critical<00:02:49.380> speed<00:02:49.860> and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
they have a higher critical speed and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.020 
they have a higher critical speed and
they<00:02:51.690> actually<00:02:52.320> could<00:02:52.500> absorb<00:02:52.950> two<00:02:53.580> more

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
they actually could absorb two more

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.120 
they actually could absorb two more
times<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.750> twist<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:56.660> aluminum<00:02:57.660> driveshaft

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
times to twist as aluminum driveshaft

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.500 
times to twist as aluminum driveshaft
now<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.520> have<00:02:59.550> six<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> car<00:03:00.330> you're

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
now so you have six on the car you're

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.170 
now so you have six on the car you're
launching<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.320> safe<00:03:01.860> 500<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:02.730> 500

these undergo certain amount of flex and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.280 
these undergo certain amount of flex and
twist<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.880> carbon<00:03:12.150> fiber<00:03:12.390> could<00:03:12.930> withstand

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
twist the carbon fiber could withstand

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.220 
twist the carbon fiber could withstand
two<00:03:13.710> times<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.220> amount<00:03:14.990> that's<00:03:15.990> what<00:03:16.110> some

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
two times that amount that's what some

two times that amount that's what some
of<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> reason<00:03:16.560> why<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.710> lot<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:17.690> high

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
of the reason why a lot of high

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.600 
of the reason why a lot of high
horsepower<00:03:19.020> cars<00:03:19.410> use<00:03:19.560> carbon<00:03:19.890> 5<00:03:20.040> driveshafts

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610
