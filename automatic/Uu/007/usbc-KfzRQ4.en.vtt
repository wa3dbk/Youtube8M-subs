00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the base then I cut it right down the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.359 
the base then I cut it right down the
center<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.410> i<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.619> show<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.800> guys<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.279> you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530 
base this is what's supposed to be
looking<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.820> iron<00:01:29.970> bars<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.479> the

thick so right now this is too thick and

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
thick so right now this is too thick and
so<00:01:36.150> yeah<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.560> too

don't want people to be clip or free cam
into<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.470> base<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> roof<00:01:44.939> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
into your base and this is the roof this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.190 
into your base and this is the roof this
is<00:01:45.270> where<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> roof<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.780> supposed<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> be

this height now i will show you what the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
this height now i will show you what the
base<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.020> supposed<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> look<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
base is supposed to look like when it's

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.999 
base is supposed to look like when it's
done<00:01:50.750> ok<00:01:51.750> guys<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.259> base<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> supposed<00:01:52.860> to

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
about this like we love on some servers

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.730 
about this like we love on some servers
will<00:02:16.970> actually<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:17.480> people<00:02:17.959> log<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.440> they

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
will actually like people log in they

guys I'm gonna show you guys a diagram
of<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.600> base<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.080> guys<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.410> like

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
of the base so you guys can like

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.949 
of the base so you guys can like
memorize<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:32.209> know<00:02:32.330> check<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.810> all<00:02:32.930> out

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
memorize it you know check it all out

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.290 
memorize it you know check it all out
and<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.709> what<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.160> gotta<00:02:34.340> do<00:02:34.580> it's<00:02:35.180> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
lot of resources but like I said you can

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.820 
lot of resources but like I said you can
also<00:02:37.430> use<00:02:37.550> cobblestone<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> middle

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
also use cobblestone in the middle

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.229 
also use cobblestone in the middle
like-for-like<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.280> recommend<00:02:40.610> use<00:02:40.850> obby

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
like-for-like but I recommend use obby

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.420 
like-for-like but I recommend use obby
it's<00:02:41.600> or<00:02:42.020> bedrock<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.680> plan<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.890> Funkytown

it's or bedrock if you plan to Funkytown
I<00:02:43.459> know<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.850> server<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.390> get<00:02:44.630> better

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I know that server you can get better

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.810 
I know that server you can get better
