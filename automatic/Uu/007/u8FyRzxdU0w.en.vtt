I bought them for me there there were
about<00:00:51.059> 20<00:00:51.510> pounds<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> roughly<00:00:53.879> over<00:00:54.090> in

America about 37 to 40 dollars just give
me<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> quick<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.969> at<00:01:00.090> them<00:01:03.979> these<00:01:04.979> shocks

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
me a quick look at them these shocks

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
me a quick look at them these shocks
haven't<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.820> oil<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:07.350> came

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
haven't got oil in them and they came

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
haven't got oil in them and they came
without<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.950> oil<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.909> buy

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
without the oil which have to buy

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
without the oil which have to buy
separately<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.290> we'll<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.590> using<00:01:10.710> atomic

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
separately and we'll be using atomic

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.469 
separately and we'll be using atomic
Tamiya<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.369> silicone<00:01:14.369> oil<00:01:15.229> soft<00:01:17.180> your<00:01:18.180> oil

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
Tamiya and silicone oil soft your oil

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
Tamiya and silicone oil soft your oil
will<00:01:18.900> usually<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.950> measured<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:21.380> where<00:01:22.580> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
will usually be measured in where but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
will usually be measured in where but
mine<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.000> slightly<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:27.750> just

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
mine was slightly different and it just

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.920 
mine was slightly different and it just
said<00:01:28.320> 300<00:01:29.310> 400<00:01:30.950> 3<00:01:31.950> sorry<00:01:32.610> 200<00:01:33.329> frames<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
said 300 400 3 sorry 200 frames and a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.280 
said 300 400 3 sorry 200 frames and a
400<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.799> will<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.729> using<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> 400<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
400 I will be using a 400 because that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.490 
400 I will be using a 400 because that
was<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.829> heaviest<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:40.340> yeah

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
was the heaviest and yeah

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.040 
was the heaviest and yeah
these<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.000> you'll<00:01:44.480> obviously<00:01:44.600> have

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
these this is the you'll obviously have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.740 
these this is the you'll obviously have
to<00:01:45.200> take<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.620> shocks<00:01:45.860> off<00:01:46.190> your<00:01:46.370> car<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:47.240> this

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
to take the shocks off your car and this

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.430 
to take the shocks off your car and this
is<00:01:47.900> what<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.140> looks<00:01:48.290> like<00:01:49.630> with<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.050> your<00:01:51.260> car

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
is what it looks like with this your car

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.370 
is what it looks like with this your car
up<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:52.190> finish<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:52.580> one<00:01:52.760> earlier<00:01:53.380> just

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
up then to finish this one earlier just

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.590 
up then to finish this one earlier just
nice<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.250> soft<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.790> should<00:01:56.270> have<00:01:56.390> that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
nice and soft and should have that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.190 
nice and soft and should have that
spring<00:01:57.050> back<00:01:57.290> action<00:01:58.900> where's<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.050> one

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
spring back action where's the one

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.600 
spring back action where's the one
without<00:02:01.210> it's<00:02:02.210> very<00:02:02.540> soft<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.860> doesn't

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
without it's very soft and just doesn't

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
without it's very soft and just doesn't
work<00:02:04.760> as<00:02:04.940> well<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:10.030> start<00:02:11.030> off<00:02:11.150> you're

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
work as well so start off you're

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.180 
work as well so start off you're
obviously<00:02:11.840> going<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.290> need<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.650> take<00:02:12.830> off<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
obviously going to need to take off the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.900 
obviously going to need to take off the
cap<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.610> shock<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:15.459> sometimes<00:02:16.459> we'll<00:02:16.760> be

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
cap of the shock and sometimes we'll be

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.400 
cap of the shock and sometimes we'll be
screwed<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.270> quite<00:02:17.480> tightly<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.230> might

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
screwed on quite tightly so you might

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.530 
screwed on quite tightly so you might
need<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.680> use<00:02:18.709> some<00:02:18.950> pliers<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:20.060> take<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.360> top

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
need to use some pliers to take the top

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.870 
need to use some pliers to take the top
off<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.440> think<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.280> should<00:02:22.459> be<00:02:22.580> okay<00:02:22.790> in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
off but I think I should be okay in

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.000 
off but I think I should be okay in
Marcus<00:02:25.390> but<00:02:26.390> before<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:27.020> do<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.830> will

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
Marcus but before you do that you will

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
Marcus but before you do that you will
need<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.220> take<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.490> spring<00:02:28.910> off<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.900> will<00:02:30.020> give

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
need to take the spring off it will give

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.440 
need to take the spring off it will give
you<00:02:30.230> easier<00:02:30.560> access<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.400> will<00:02:31.550> come<00:02:31.820> in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
you easier access and it will come in

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.150 
you easier access and it will come in
handy<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.950> feel<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.520> shock<00:02:34.700> up<00:02:36.160> with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
handy when you feel the shock up with

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.370 
handy when you feel the shock up with

like<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.440> screw<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.280> off<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.840> should<00:03:51.990> be

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
like that screw it off and it should be

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.560 
like that screw it off and it should be
empty

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570

good<00:04:15.450> for<00:04:15.570> drifting<00:04:15.960> as<00:04:16.170> well<00:04:26.930> so<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.020> want<00:04:28.110> to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
good for drifting as well so you want to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.310 
good for drifting as well so you want to
fill<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.680> shock<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:29.040> right<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.910> top<00:04:30.320> to

three<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.850> these<00:04:39.260> with<00:04:40.260> different<00:04:40.740> weights<00:04:41.900> so

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
three of these with different weights so

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.510 
three of these with different weights so
I<00:04:42.930> can<00:04:43.080> always<00:04:43.200> refill<00:04:45.470> she's<00:04:46.470> good<00:04:49.250> this<00:04:50.250> film

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
I can always refill she's good this film

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:02.689 
I can always refill she's good this film
was<00:04:50.670> shot<00:04:50.820> cry<00:04:51.150> up

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.079 

then<00:05:03.699> you<00:05:03.999> want<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.830> just<00:05:05.830> work<00:05:06.219> the<00:05:06.520> piston<00:05:06.909> up

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.089 
then you want to just work the piston up

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.350 
then you want to just work the piston up
and<00:05:07.330> down<00:05:08.249> get<00:05:09.249> rid<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.669> air<00:05:09.789> bubbles<00:05:09.819> but

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
and down get rid of the air bubbles but

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.589 
and down get rid of the air bubbles but
make<00:05:10.629> sure<00:05:10.659> not<00:05:11.559> to<00:05:11.889> bring<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.639> piston<00:05:13.120> above

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
make sure not to bring the piston above

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.689 
make sure not to bring the piston above
the<00:05:13.779> oil<00:05:13.930> because<00:05:14.800> this<00:05:14.949> will<00:05:15.189> result<00:05:15.490> in

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
the oil because this will result in

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.089 
the oil because this will result in
bringing<00:05:16.089> more<00:05:16.240> air<00:05:16.509> into<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.110> into<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.919> shop

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
bringing more air into the into the shop

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:25.049 
bringing more air into the into the shop
itself<00:05:19.469> so<00:05:20.469> we<00:05:20.529> can<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.919> see<00:05:23.759> most<00:05:24.759> of<00:05:24.909> the

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:25.059 
itself so we can just see most of the

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:39.379 
itself so we can just see most of the
Purple's<00:05:25.389> are<00:05:25.509> gone

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.529 

this<00:05:40.389> is<00:05:40.599> a<00:05:40.919> quite<00:05:41.919> soft<00:05:42.309> dial<00:05:42.520> so<00:05:42.819> much

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
this is a quite soft dial so much

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:50.070 
this is a quite soft dial so much
traffic<00:05:43.809> up<00:05:44.020> as<00:05:44.139> much<00:05:44.319> to<00:05:44.559> come<00:05:44.740> in<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:49.270> screw

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
traffic up as much to come in and screw

00:05:50.080 --> 00:06:03.510 
traffic up as much to come in and screw
the<00:05:50.349> cap<00:05:50.379> back<00:05:50.889> on

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.730 

you<00:06:04.520> make<00:06:04.729> sure<00:06:04.780> really<00:06:05.780> tight<00:06:06.020> so<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.560> don't

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
you make sure really tight so it don't

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.790 
you make sure really tight so it don't
come<00:06:06.860> undone<00:06:07.099> again<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.729> that<00:06:08.419> is<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.229> you've

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
come undone again and that is it you've

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.370 
come undone again and that is it you've
got<00:06:09.919> it<00:06:10.039> filled<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.639> it<00:06:11.630> just<00:06:11.870> swings<00:06:12.080> back

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
got it filled and it just swings back

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.830 
got it filled and it just swings back
nicely<00:06:16.479> then<00:06:18.009> you<00:06:19.009> replace<00:06:19.639> the<00:06:19.970> spring<00:06:20.330> waxer

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
nicely then you replace the spring waxer

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:31.900 
nicely then you replace the spring waxer
and<00:06:26.199> pop<00:06:27.199> about<00:06:29.289> Omega<00:06:30.289> that's<00:06:30.770> it<00:06:30.919> done<00:06:31.099> and

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
and pop about Omega that's it done and

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.490 
and pop about Omega that's it done and
then<00:06:32.030> repeat<00:06:32.330> this<00:06:32.479> with<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:32.870> rest<00:06:33.020> of<00:06:33.169> shops

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
then repeat this with the rest of shops

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.480 
then repeat this with the rest of shops
and<00:06:34.539> they'll<00:06:35.539> be<00:06:35.750> ready<00:06:35.930> to<00:06:35.990> go<00:06:36.340> just<00:06:37.340> make

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
and they'll be ready to go just make

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.870 
and they'll be ready to go just make
sure<00:06:37.729> you've<00:06:38.030> got<00:06:38.060> the<00:06:39.160> third<00:06:40.160> set<00:06:40.460> properly
