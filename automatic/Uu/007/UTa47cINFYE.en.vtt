on myself and probably more pressure

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.020 
on myself and probably more pressure
than<00:02:39.630> these<00:02:39.780> guys<00:02:39.959> want<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.320> see<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> shop

over<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.270> last<00:02:42.420> year<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.020> half<00:02:43.590> or<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.010> but

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
over the last year and a half or so but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.520 
over the last year and a half or so but
it's<00:02:44.850> been<00:02:45.000> well<00:02:45.600> worth<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.959> reward<00:02:46.320> today

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
