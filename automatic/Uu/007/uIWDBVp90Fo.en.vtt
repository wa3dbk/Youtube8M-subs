00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
think I figured out a possible little

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.389 
think I figured out a possible little
configuration<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> figure<00:00:47.039> enough

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
configuration for this figure enough

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
configuration for this figure enough
I'll<00:00:47.700> show<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.149> guys<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> second
