is<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.280> video<00:00:02.490> that<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.179> hope<00:00:03.840> helps

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
is going to be a video that a hope helps

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.789 
is going to be a video that a hope helps
explain<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:05.339> little<00:00:05.640> bit<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.940> how<00:00:06.089> caster<00:00:06.810> works

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
explain a little bit of how caster works

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.919 
explain a little bit of how caster works
to<00:00:07.980> recenter<00:00:08.370> your<00:00:08.519> steering<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.000> how

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
to recenter your steering and how

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.039 
to recenter your steering and how
lifting<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.620> Jeep<00:00:11.580> or<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> vehicle<00:00:12.059> affects<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
lifting a Jeep or a vehicle affects a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.279 
lifting a Jeep or a vehicle affects a
caster<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:14.730> let's<00:00:15.690> get<00:00:15.809> started<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
caster so let's get started with a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.010 
caster so let's get started with a
couple<00:00:16.529> terms<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.279> gonna<00:00:17.400> use<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> video

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
couple terms I'm gonna use in the video

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
couple terms I'm gonna use in the video
they're<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.730> simple<00:00:20.730> terms<00:00:21.000> am

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
they're just going to be simple terms am

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.880 
they're just going to be simple terms am
I<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> make<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.439> any<00:00:22.769> more

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I going to make this any more

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.150 
I going to make this any more
complicated<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.730> needs<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.830> this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.070> going

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
complicated it needs to be this is going

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.660 
complicated it needs to be this is going
to<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> vertical<00:00:26.670> plane<00:00:27.019> it's<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> point

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
to be the vertical plane it's the point

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.730 
to be the vertical plane it's the point
at<00:00:29.670> which<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.119> tire<00:00:30.330> contacts<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> ground<00:00:31.470> is

at which the tire contacts the ground is
the<00:00:32.009> tire-contact<00:00:32.579> patch<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.430> vertical

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the tire-contact patch it's a vertical

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.370 
the tire-contact patch it's a vertical
line<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.450> runs<00:00:36.660> straight<00:00:37.110> through<00:00:37.170> the

the tire it is the lower ball joint and
the<00:00:55.350> upper<00:00:55.590> ball<00:00:55.770> joint<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.309> drew<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> line

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the upper ball joint if you drew a line

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
the upper ball joint if you drew a line
through<00:00:57.000> those<00:00:57.300> two<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.020> steering

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
through those two that is your steering

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
through those two that is your steering
axis<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> point<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.539> your

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
axis that is the point which your

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.920 
axis that is the point which your
steering<00:01:01.379> pivots<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> highly

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
steering pivots and this is highly

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
steering pivots and this is highly
exaggerated<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> video<00:01:05.189> purpose

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
exaggerated just for the video purpose

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.850 
exaggerated just for the video purpose
to<00:01:05.880> show<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:07.250> how<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:09.210> caster<00:01:09.630> angle<00:01:09.860> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to show you how the caster angle is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
to show you how the caster angle is
affected<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> lift<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> how<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> affects

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
affected as you lift and how it affects

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.100 
affected as you lift and how it affects
your<00:01:13.110> steering<00:01:13.729> alright<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> said<00:01:15.600> caster

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
your steering alright like I said caster

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.010 
your steering alright like I said caster
angle<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.330> we're<00:01:18.450> talking<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.780> today

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
angle is what we're talking about today

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.399 
angle is what we're talking about today
so<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.729> angle<00:01:21.060> between<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:22.170> tire-contact

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
so the angle between the tire-contact

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.960 
so the angle between the tire-contact
patch<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> steering<00:01:24.150> axis<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> here

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
patch and the steering axis here to here

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.780 
patch and the steering axis here to here
that<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.390> caster<00:01:27.810> angle<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.790> positive

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that is your caster angle a positive

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.960 
that is your caster angle a positive
caster<00:01:30.000> angle<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.970> more

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
caster angle is going to have a more

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630 
caster angle is going to have a more
leading<00:01:33.420> bottom<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.189> top<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
leading bottom and the top is going to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
leading bottom and the top is going to
be<00:01:35.700> trailing<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.240> means<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> top<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.869> going

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
be trailing which means the top is going

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
be trailing which means the top is going
to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.140> further<00:01:37.380> back<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.970> positive

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to be further back that is positive

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.080 
to be further back that is positive
caster<00:01:39.860> if<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.220> complete<00:01:41.520> opposite<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
caster if it was complete opposite that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
caster if it was complete opposite that
would<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.240> negative<00:01:42.390> caster<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> was

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
would be negative caster and if it was

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
would be negative caster and if it was
directly<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.490> line<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.329> tire-contact

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
directly in line with the tire-contact

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.440 
directly in line with the tire-contact
patch<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.399> zero<00:01:47.909> degrees<00:01:48.299> caster

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
patch that would be zero degrees caster

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.280 
patch that would be zero degrees caster
from<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> factory<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.070> Jeep<00:01:53.970> JK<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
from the factory this is a Jeep JK so it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.609 
from the factory this is a Jeep JK so it
has<00:01:55.439> roughly<00:01:55.740> four<00:01:56.009> degrees<00:01:56.310> positive<00:01:57.090> caster

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
has roughly four degrees positive caster

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.789 
has roughly four degrees positive caster
now<00:01:58.619> once<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> lift<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.060> vehicle<00:02:00.799> whether

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
now once you lift this vehicle whether

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.859 
now once you lift this vehicle whether
its<00:02:02.100> Springs<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.820> pucks<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.600> you're

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
its Springs or pucks if you're

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.420 
its Springs or pucks if you're

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the axle and the bottom of the frame you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.210 
the axle and the bottom of the frame you
are<00:02:08.690> essentially<00:02:09.800> forcing<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> lower

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
are essentially forcing the lower

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.610 
are essentially forcing the lower
control<00:02:11.459> arm<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.569> go<00:02:12.690> down<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
control arm to go down and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.850 
control arm to go down and
once<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.920> happens<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.200> steering<00:02:16.200> axis<00:02:16.680> is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
once this happens the steering axis is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.990 
once this happens the steering axis is
tilted<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.090> its<00:02:18.569> turn<00:02:18.780> closer<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:20.879> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
tilted in its turn closer to the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.869 
tilted in its turn closer to the
tire-contact<00:02:21.239> patch<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.620> see<00:02:22.799> here<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.730> as

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
tire-contact patch as you see here so as

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.869 
tire-contact patch as you see here so as
you<00:02:24.000> lift<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.830> further<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.040> lift<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.640> more

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
you lift the further you lift the more

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.899 
you lift the further you lift the more
the<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:28.200> axle<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.650> rotated<00:02:29.069> forward<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.610> that

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
the the axle is rotated forward and that

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.270 
the the axle is rotated forward and that
steering<00:02:30.329> axis<00:02:30.720> becomes<00:02:31.409> more<00:02:31.590> vertical<00:02:32.129> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
steering axis becomes more vertical and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.490 
steering axis becomes more vertical and
you<00:02:32.310> lose<00:02:33.060> positive<00:02:33.690> caster<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:36.170> why<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.230> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
you lose positive caster so why is this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.899 
you lose positive caster so why is this
important<00:02:38.269> well<00:02:39.920> caster<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.220> used<00:02:41.610> to

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
important well caster is used to

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.750 
important well caster is used to
recenter<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> wheel<00:02:43.079> after<00:02:44.040> turn<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.640> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
recenter the wheel after turn and it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.569 
recenter the wheel after turn and it
helps<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.150> maintain<00:02:45.799> true<00:02:46.799> driving<00:02:47.310> while

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
helps it maintain true driving while

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.780 
helps it maintain true driving while
everyone<00:02:47.819> down<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> down<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.750> road<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.799> it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
everyone down the down the road and it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.699 
everyone down the down the road and it
does<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.329> by<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:54.410> different<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.500> length

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
does this by the different the length

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.009 
does this by the different the length
between<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.790> steering<00:02:57.299> axis<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
between the steering axis and the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.130 
between the steering axis and the
tire-contact<00:02:58.260> patch<00:02:59.239> so<00:03:00.239> at<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.870> point

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
tire-contact patch so at this point

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.839 
tire-contact patch so at this point
right<00:03:01.349> here<00:03:01.409> like<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.099> said<00:03:02.129> is<00:03:02.400> where<00:03:02.579> your

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
right here like I said is where your

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.470 
right here like I said is where your
steering<00:03:03.269> pivots<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.819> we<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:05.970> use<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.239> pin

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
steering pivots so we can use this pin

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.339 
steering pivots so we can use this pin
as<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.659> representation<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.420> we're

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
as a representation this is a we're

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.960 
as a representation this is a we're
going<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.530> say<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.040> experiment<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:11.909> is

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
going to say for this experiment this is

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.449 
going to say for this experiment this is
4<00:03:12.299> degrees<00:03:12.599> positive<00:03:13.049> caster<00:03:13.260> all<00:03:14.159> right<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
4 degrees positive caster all right so

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.270 
4 degrees positive caster all right so
the<00:03:14.579> link<00:03:14.790> between<00:03:14.970> here<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.620> what

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
the link between here and here is what

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.289 
the link between here and here is what
it<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.489> from<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.700> factory<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.440> turn

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
it is from the factory so as you turn

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.780 
it is from the factory so as you turn
you're<00:03:21.299> going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.510> pivot<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you're going to pivot here and the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.960 
you're going to pivot here and the
tire-contact<00:03:24.030> patch<00:03:24.269> swings<00:03:25.049> out<00:03:25.700> well<00:03:26.700> since

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
tire-contact patch swings out well since

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.640 
tire-contact patch swings out well since
the<00:03:27.030> tire-contact<00:03:27.299> patch<00:03:27.450> swings<00:03:28.139> out<00:03:28.349> here

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the tire-contact patch swings out here

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.819 
the tire-contact patch swings out here
you're<00:03:29.250> having<00:03:29.609> forces<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.419> are<00:03:30.540> pushing

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
you're having forces that are pushing

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.069 
you're having forces that are pushing
against<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:32.120> via<00:03:33.120> friction<00:03:33.419> that<00:03:33.750> pushes

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
against it via friction that pushes

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
against it via friction that pushes
against<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.220> forces<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:35.730> tire

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
against it here and it forces this tire

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000 
against it here and it forces this tire
to<00:03:36.120> go<00:03:36.209> back<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.540> centre

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
to go back to centre

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.949 
to go back to centre
alright<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.359> lift<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.750> vehicle<00:03:40.010> and

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
alright so as you lift the vehicle and

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.509 
alright so as you lift the vehicle and
you<00:03:42.959> lessen<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.919> amount<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.750> positive<00:03:45.750> caster

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
you lessen the amount of positive caster

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.509 
you lessen the amount of positive caster
now<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:48.359> just<00:03:48.540> pin<00:03:48.750> top<00:03:48.989> because<00:03:49.769> it's<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
now you just pin top because it's the

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.460 
now you just pin top because it's the
difference<00:03:50.639> in<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> distance<00:03:51.419> between<00:03:51.569> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
difference in the distance between the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.390 
difference in the distance between the
tire-contact<00:03:52.709> patch<00:03:52.949> and<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:55.290> steering<00:03:55.650> axis

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
tire-contact patch and the steering axis

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.750 
tire-contact patch and the steering axis
so<00:03:56.879> now<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.599> only<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.260> much

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
so now you only have this much

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.339 
so now you only have this much
separation<00:03:59.760> between<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.329> two<00:04:00.510> as<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.169> kicks

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
separation between the two as it kicks

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.339 
separation between the two as it kicks
out<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:02.310> requires<00:04:02.639> more<00:04:02.940> force<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.930> push<00:04:04.139> the

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
out it requires more force to push the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.460 
out it requires more force to push the
same<00:04:04.590> tire<00:04:05.810> back<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.019> Center

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
same tire back to Center

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.470 
same tire back to Center
well<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.370> haven't<00:04:08.549> increased<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.090> friction

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
well you haven't increased the friction

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.539 
well you haven't increased the friction
on<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.690> road<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.349> friction<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.799> same<00:04:11.040> so

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
on the road the friction is the same so

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.970 
on the road the friction is the same so
your<00:04:12.030> tire<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.599> less<00:04:13.049> likely<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.470> return<00:04:13.769> to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
your tire is less likely to return to

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.670 
your tire is less likely to return to
center<00:04:14.359> with<00:04:15.359> this<00:04:15.540> little<00:04:15.870> amount<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.260> a

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
center with this little amount of a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.219 
center with this little amount of a
mechanical<00:04:17.190> advantage<00:04:17.310> here<00:04:18.019> so<00:04:19.019> what<00:04:19.109> you

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
mechanical advantage here so what you

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.770 
mechanical advantage here so what you
need<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.470> do<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.489> need<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.699> lengthen<00:04:21.180> the

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
need to do is you need to lengthen the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.530 
need to do is you need to lengthen the
lower<00:04:21.959> control<00:04:22.229> arm<00:04:22.789> shortly<00:04:23.789> upper<00:04:24.120> control

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
lower control arm shortly upper control

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.230 
lower control arm shortly upper control
arm<00:04:24.690> or<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.050> variation<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.890> both<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.090> is

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
arm or a variation of both and this is

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.270 
arm or a variation of both and this is
going<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.450> give<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.410> positive<00:04:29.100> caster

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
going to give you the positive caster

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.990 
going to give you the positive caster
that<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.730> need<00:04:31.520> once<00:04:32.520> again

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
that you need once again

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.400 
that you need once again
the<00:04:33.810> steering<00:04:34.170> axis<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:37.170> tire

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
the steering axis is here the tire

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.890 
the steering axis is here the tire
rotates<00:04:37.860> out<00:04:38.040> your<00:04:38.850> vertical<00:04:39.210> plane<00:04:39.420> is<00:04:39.750> at

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
rotates out your vertical plane is at

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.990 
rotates out your vertical plane is at
the<00:04:39.990> end<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.260> pin<00:04:40.730> therefore<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:41.880> have

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
the end of the pin therefore you have

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.660 
the end of the pin therefore you have
the<00:04:42.120> mechanical<00:04:42.570> advantage<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:44.040> push<00:04:44.220> back<00:04:44.400> in

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
the mechanical advantage to push back in

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.590 
the mechanical advantage to push back in
with<00:04:45.630> less<00:04:45.840> caster<00:04:46.880> closer<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.270> vertical

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
with less caster closer to the vertical

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.870 
with less caster closer to the vertical
plane<00:04:49.670> you<00:04:50.670> have<00:04:50.850> less<00:04:51.180> mechanical<00:04:51.360> advantage

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
plane you have less mechanical advantage

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.460 
plane you have less mechanical advantage
therefore<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.390> tire<00:04:54.600> does<00:04:54.870> not<00:04:55.020> return<00:04:55.320> to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
therefore the tire does not return to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.740 
therefore the tire does not return to
center<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.760> you<00:04:56.850> get<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.090> wandering<00:04:57.570> or

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
center and you get it wandering or

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.470 
center and you get it wandering or
flighty<00:04:58.050> feeling<00:04:58.470> as<00:04:59.090> you<00:05:00.090> are<00:05:00.180> at<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.390> the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
flighty feeling as you are at in the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.860 
flighty feeling as you are at in the
road

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
road

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.780 
road
I<00:05:00.930> hope<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.620> helps<00:05:01.890> explain<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.400> some<00:05:02.550> people

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
I hope this helps explain to some people

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.720 
I hope this helps explain to some people
that<00:05:02.820> were<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.840> little<00:05:04.080> unclear<00:05:04.290> on<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.700> have<00:05:05.700> a

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
that were a little unclear on it have a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.970 
that were a little unclear on it have a
