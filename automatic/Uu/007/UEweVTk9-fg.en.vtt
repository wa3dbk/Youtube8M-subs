00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.330
 and then another video is coming 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.009
 video of today leaving you as you do 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.770
 to install the textures of the mini 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.560
 crash and also how to strip those 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 they stay in the game I do not know 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.840
 if you have already noticed the objects of the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 maine craft are not totally mice 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 there is a half of a non- deformity 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.580
 those are boring Riccardo 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.519
 if you want a legal graphic quality 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.949
 is a pretty good game active goods 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.320
 vibrant graphics 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.750
 This is a bit of a nuisance. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.430
 played in the settings itself does not have 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.830
 option so you can take this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.540
 serrated then we just go 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.460
 to be able to draw through the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.739
 nvidia control 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 if you have no assurance of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.189
 nvidia 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.320
 You have to apologize, no football. 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.809
 I would like to explain in any other way but 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.119
 I promise you that I have discovered a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.710
 another way to get those affiliates 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.380
 I'll post here on the channel for who 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
 do not have nvidia video cards 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.969
 Let's start the first time, guys. 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.439
 How do you do the tapas? 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.920
 first you will have to be with 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.109
 your open game in the state and so far 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.060
 as you can see you will go 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.969
 in the control panel 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.719
 I shot the saber and we will click the button 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:34.189
 right into account the process it goes to 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.060
 the processes and here in this java ex point 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.109
 you normally have to click the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.920
 right 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:44.630
 Let's go, yes, the open fire location that goes 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 open to where the game such as installed in the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.490
 again right click people 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.049
 lose properties and let's copy 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.369
 this directory here O 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.950
 only copy you can close it all come on 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.560
 in our work area click on the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.780
 right click and go aquino nvidia 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.549
 continued fennell tire 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.580
 I do not know if it was 72 for it to be 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.270
 talking all right same is very good will 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.069
 to open it here you can see that 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.860
 he has appeared here in this eminem of 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.400
 three seven months 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.560
 the technique now in to drink it will open 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.760
 this window then you just click 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.280
 on here 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.640
 he drinks you you glue you 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.360
 copied from a space and looked for 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.080
 java wqs file here look let's open 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.380
 he 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.350
 it is here in this option here 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.720
 leasing is going to be like off 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.780
 So you're out of the ordinary, that's what's going on. 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.959
 make your edges stay in mice 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.130
 without any kind of crack side thing 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.959
 of the type 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.260
 I do not know if you have any other options 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.250
 Here to make it prettier, I think so. 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 there is, for example, here is something 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.280
 of quality texture which can 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.280
 leave a lightning bolt 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.709
 raimi rage i think it went wrong well 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.170
 have other options I have one more 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.650
 searched to see why they 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.959
 They should be the case but ultimately to 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.489
 you take the show is that same option 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.180
 You're leaving one that's going to be connected. 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.680
 apply and enjoy your game without any 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.660
 closed type 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.060
 now I'll be as you do to be able to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.860
 install the textures beauty she already 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 left our game at the gate without any 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.900
 type of roof then as only now the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.260
 texture that will give all that color and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.830
 that beautiful thing from a mini crash 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.220
 custom 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.650
 I found this one from here that is the 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.110
 so I do not like this photorealism 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.269
 mix I think she's not so pretty 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.780
 As for the other one I have, I think 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.340
 which is the flower hd drown more beautiful 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.650
 Just to be able to explain to me 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.019
 you to vote using it 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.850
 she came from above fitted does not need 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.980
 neither can unpacking leave it that way 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.200
 even you will click on the menu 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.910
 start and will enter percentage app 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.500
 New date of this passes here someone 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.570
 you click on it 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.979
 the first part is that he appeared 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.120
 the point of greatest craft 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.120
 you can stay again 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.040
 simple is only you drag your texture 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.400
 automatically when you start 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.050
 the game since there it for you to choose 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.450
 let's advance in the game that could not 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:47.830
 to be there for you, how did I have it? 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:51.140
 this stance here in the game will be in options 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.510
 package of textures and what you can see 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.700
 all my bike textures using 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.400
 from here drowning in 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.060
 This is what I used in the video. 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.670
 previous I was going to do the modern house 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.230
 and I also have these others here only 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.050
 so they sound as beautiful as 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.550
 This is how I come in the game now. 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.000
 for you to see the final result 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.030
 and here we are, the end result is 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.350
 a true seamless texture this 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.230
 here is the layout of the most 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.600
 I've seen trainee craft and the 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.250
 roofs you may realize that you 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.860
 has it 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.330
 the block it becomes totally mouse and 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.210
 does not have that deformity that 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.970
 usually it would be I'm going to go in here 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.290
 inside to get in here was great 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.510
 it's the pleonasm 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:43.180
 but anyway let's get you here 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:46.430
 can see what the texture looks like 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.130
 It's very cool really where 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.300
 It's worth your time to put this one here. 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.130
 your game 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.400
 If that happened, I could take it because it is 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:58.630
 It's a very heavy texture, I'm going 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.630
 put another here for you to see 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.100
 I'll put the one that is that picture 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.860
 realism people who are texture 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.800
 photorealism her this is a position as 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.580
 modern is more textured if more rustic and 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.530
 tals 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.200
 but it is still a texture without 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.560
 very very beautiful indeed and she is well 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.930
 lighter than flower blooms well 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.830
 heavier then I am against was not so 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.500
 good 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.530
 You can use this one here that will give a 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.700
 very cool result too 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.400
 guys, I know, I hope you guys 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.220
 have tanned and video do not leave the 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.410
 your favorite and logical sign up 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.610
 on the spot if you have not yet been enrolled 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.610
 Kiss you, what do you think? 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.289
 beautiful that we have distances face to fix 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.840
 bengo niterói 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.639
 all this money is going to leave the fifa and 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.219
 income nor Spanish 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.319
 in this case my floor thinking of 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:55.719
 grow and this is good because my 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:58.270
 history of time a gift of monopolies 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.930
 institution is a slight impact of a 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.930
 champion
