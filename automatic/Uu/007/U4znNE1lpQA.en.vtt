00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.240
 today we will try to graft spruce 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.639
 barbed date we have another kapha psy 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 This we have a spruce fir glauca but green 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:27.710
 the form will be inculcated so familiar 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:31.099
 shears he does the same cut on 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.099
 stock and graft 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.980
 First you need to cut on the stock 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.980
 unnecessary large branches 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.080
 some branches we leave but then them 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.080
 fresh when vaccination takes root 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.509
 here I took kuksi 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.860
 and another combination of the thickness of the trunk 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.560
 I get here in this place and here 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.569
 here is the same 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 almost that is, we have a vaccination site 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:34.390
 will be like this to start 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.070
 need to vaccinate needles to clear but 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.810
 wolves can not tear off 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.810
 cut with small scissors 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.300
 what kind of husband are you 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.630
 we cut off close to the trunk 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.160
 now we have February Ilya brought with 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
 streets 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.440
 because sap flow is small 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.920
 practically still absent therefore 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.420
 easy in the spring when active begins 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.420
 promotion whether it is very difficult 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:27.050
 here we have cleared two tables now we will 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.050
 in this place to be vaccinated on a stock 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.189
 we already robots middle 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.480
 that's what we did 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.430
 will be 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.960
 same 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.960
 we do 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.230
 you are a warrior 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.820
 it turned out 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.820
 now we combine connected 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.060
 almost perfectly match 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.890
 Chernov houses a big stranger 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.520
 for doing it 1 time 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.180
 complicated 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.750
 grafting a stranger to them 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.750
 Well, probably on the tenth I will already start 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.750
 get mine 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.130
 to all 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.930
 we will we here I did it 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.819
 Well, in general 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:43.680
 Now you need to leave this vaccine in 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.340
 warm room at 25 degrees and in 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.620
 the vaccine should take root within 7 days 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:52.409
 but this concerns deciduous and coniferous not 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.949
 I know I probably check the same thing 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:08:00.689
 let's see how we did it 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:06.469
 graft cutting the whole trunk here 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:06.469
 then we clean the cube haylage there we 

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.970
 we'll see in a week
