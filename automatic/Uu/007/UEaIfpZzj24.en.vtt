pairing ball chain with the Scrabble
tiles<00:00:26.840> I<00:00:27.170> think<00:00:27.350> it's<00:00:27.470> kind<00:00:27.650> of<00:00:27.680> fun<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:27.950> funky

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
tiles I think it's kind of fun and funky

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.880 
tiles I think it's kind of fun and funky
they<00:00:29.180> seem<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.450> go<00:00:29.570> together<00:00:29.720> very<00:00:29.930> well<00:00:30.350> I

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
they seem to go together very well I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.600 
have a stainless steel and a black one
here<00:00:33.020> I'll<00:00:33.470> probably<00:00:33.620> use<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:33.980> black<00:00:34.190> one<00:00:34.430> but

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
here I'll probably use the black one but

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.640 
here I'll probably use the black one but
I<00:00:35.090> do<00:00:35.480> want<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.780> let<00:00:35.900> you<00:00:35.960> know<00:00:36.200> that<00:00:36.410> there<00:00:36.530> are

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
my square epoxy stickers which are going

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.620 
my square epoxy stickers which are going
to<00:00:45.680> fit<00:00:45.950> nicely<00:00:45.980> on<00:00:46.610> top<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.239> Scrabble

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
to fit nicely on top of the Scrabble

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.260 
to fit nicely on top of the Scrabble
tiles<00:00:47.810> I<00:00:48.290> have<00:00:49.070> several<00:00:49.700> different<00:00:50.030> choices

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
tiles I have several different choices

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.069 
tiles I have several different choices
of<00:00:50.570> on<00:00:51.170> Ricou<00:00:51.559> bails<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.220> what<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:53.059> ruku<00:00:53.870> bail

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
of on Ricou bails and what on ruku bail

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.470 
of on Ricou bails and what on ruku bail
is<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.620> it's<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.860> bail<00:00:55.040> that<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.460> gluon<00:00:56.059> bail

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
is is it's a bail that is a gluon bail

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.180 
is is it's a bail that is a gluon bail
so<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:57.380> going<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.620> fit<00:00:57.940> just<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.090> such<00:00:59.719> and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
so it's going to fit just like such and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.740 
so it's going to fit just like such and
it's<00:01:01.190> nice<00:01:01.370> because<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.910> does<00:01:02.090> have<00:01:02.270> that<00:01:02.480> nice

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
it's nice because it does have that nice

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.990 
it's nice because it does have that nice
loop<00:01:03.110> up<00:01:03.320> top<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.890> then<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.070> also<00:01:04.250> has<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.580> ridge

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
loop up top and then it also has a ridge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.870 
loop up top and then it also has a ridge
which<00:01:05.299> is<00:01:05.330> going<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.630> allow<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:06.729> scrabble<00:01:07.729> tile

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
