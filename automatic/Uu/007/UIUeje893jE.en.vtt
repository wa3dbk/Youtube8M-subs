understanding and the Lexx explanation

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.150 
understanding and the Lexx explanation
you'll<00:00:16.930> have<00:00:17.050> to<00:00:17.170> make<00:00:17.290> to<00:00:17.530> set<00:00:17.920> up<00:00:18.010> each

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
you'll have to make to set up each

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.550 
you'll have to make to set up each
exercise<00:00:18.850> so<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.840> first<00:00:20.050> thing<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.320> want<00:00:20.500> to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
exercise so the first thing you want to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.500 
exercise so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:20.740> as<00:00:21.280> the<00:00:21.490> kids<00:00:21.670> arrived<00:00:21.940> your<00:00:22.120> practice

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
do as the kids arrived your practice

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
do as the kids arrived your practice
because<00:00:22.690> they<00:00:22.810> typically<00:00:23.140> arrive<00:00:23.380> at

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
because they typically arrive at

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.500 
because they typically arrive at
different<00:00:23.620> times<00:00:24.070> have<00:00:24.850> them<00:00:25.030> start<00:00:25.270> throwing

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
different times have them start throwing

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.420 
different times have them start throwing
the<00:00:25.630> ball<00:00:25.780> lightly<00:00:26.200> to<00:00:26.350> each<00:00:26.440> other<00:00:26.740> I<00:00:27.100> would

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
the ball lightly to each other I would

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.580 
the ball lightly to each other I would
have<00:00:27.700> them<00:00:27.850> encourage<00:00:28.270> them<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.420> do<00:00:28.600> maybe<00:00:28.870> 25

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
have them encourage them to do maybe 25

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.130 
have them encourage them to do maybe 25
to<00:00:29.620> 30<00:00:30.040> thrown<00:00:30.520> baseballs<00:00:31.060> back<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:31.480> forth<00:00:31.720> at

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
to 30 thrown baseballs back and forth at

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.049 
to 30 thrown baseballs back and forth at
a<00:00:32.200> short<00:00:32.589> distance<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.250> gradually<00:00:33.730> moving

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
a short distance and gradually moving

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.790 
a short distance and gradually moving
back<00:00:34.269> apart<00:00:34.660> from<00:00:34.809> one<00:00:35.019> another<00:00:35.289> to<00:00:35.379> create<00:00:35.500> it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
back apart from one another to create it

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.160 
back apart from one another to create it
longer<00:00:36.219> throw<00:00:36.489> in<00:00:37.300> addition<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:37.899> have

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
longer throw in addition to that have

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.200 
longer throw in addition to that have
them<00:00:38.289> take<00:00:38.499> 25<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.190> 30<00:00:39.399> ground<00:00:39.670> balls<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:40.059> each

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
them take 25 to 30 ground balls to each

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.060 
them take 25 to 30 ground balls to each
other<00:00:40.449> those<00:00:41.410> would<00:00:41.589> be<00:00:41.649> a<00:00:41.679> great<00:00:41.920> way<00:00:42.039> to

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
other those would be a great way to

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.590 
other those would be a great way to
start<00:00:42.370> every<00:00:42.579> practice<00:00:42.999> and<00:00:43.149> make<00:00:43.239> sure<00:00:43.359> every

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
start every practice and make sure every

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.569 
start every practice and make sure every
kid<00:00:43.809> gets<00:00:43.960> 50<00:00:44.379> or<00:00:44.499> so<00:00:44.679> throws<00:00:45.249> with<00:00:45.519> the

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
kid gets 50 or so throws with the

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.939 
kid gets 50 or so throws with the
baseball<00:00:45.969> in<00:00:46.559> after<00:00:47.559> they<00:00:47.649> do<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.800> little

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
baseball in after they do a little

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.439 
baseball in after they do a little
warm-up<00:00:48.309> because<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:48.760> important<00:00:49.179> before<00:00:49.269> we

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
warm-up because it's important before we

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.329 
warm-up because it's important before we
do<00:00:49.629> any<00:00:49.780> type<00:00:50.019> of<00:00:50.050> stretching<00:00:50.379> for<00:00:50.800> any<00:00:50.949> sport

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
do any type of stretching for any sport

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.160 
do any type of stretching for any sport
or<00:00:51.550> any<00:00:51.670> activity<00:00:52.089> to<00:00:52.539> always<00:00:52.780> have<00:00:52.929> blood

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
or any activity to always have blood

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.110 
or any activity to always have blood
flow<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.649> muscle<00:00:53.949> groups<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:54.850> purpose

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
flow to the muscle groups so the purpose

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.340 
flow to the muscle groups so the purpose
of<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.239> warming<00:00:55.600> up<00:00:55.690> or<00:00:55.780> throwing<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.199> ball

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
of that warming up or throwing the ball

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.750 
of that warming up or throwing the ball
and<00:00:56.530> moving<00:00:56.800> back<00:00:56.890> around<00:00:57.249> a<00:00:57.339> little<00:00:57.429> bit<00:00:57.609> is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
and moving back around a little bit is

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.040 
and moving back around a little bit is
get<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.059> blood<00:00:58.239> flow<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.629> muscle<00:00:58.899> groups

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
get that blood flow to the muscle groups

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.049 
get that blood flow to the muscle groups
before<00:00:59.260> we<00:00:59.499> go<00:00:59.620> into<00:00:59.769> our<00:00:59.859> stretches<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.609> now

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
before we go into our stretches and now

these stretches we want to go in a slow
and<00:01:12.280> controlled<00:01:12.340> manner<00:01:13.030> we<00:01:13.360> want<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.600> avoid

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
and controlled manner we want to avoid
