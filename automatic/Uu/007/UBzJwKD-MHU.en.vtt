going to do that otherwise I would make

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.110 
going to do that otherwise I would make
that<00:04:03.420> NFS<00:04:03.989> box<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.680> free<00:04:04.920> snaggy<00:04:05.670> okay

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
that NFS box it is like free snaggy okay

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.840 
that NFS box it is like free snaggy okay
25<00:04:06.989> G's<00:04:07.350> for<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:08.190> let's<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:08.550> how<00:04:08.610> nice<00:04:08.820> it

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
25 G's for that let's see how nice it

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.520 
25 G's for that let's see how nice it
looks<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.360> looks<00:04:09.390> look<00:04:09.630> pretty<00:04:09.930> nice<00:04:10.050> indeed

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
looks it looks look pretty nice indeed

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.160 
looks it looks look pretty nice indeed
so<00:04:10.739> let's<00:04:10.920> go<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.430> download<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.930> see

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
so let's go and download that and see

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.960 
so let's go and download that and see
how<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.040> car<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.610> then<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.820> think

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
how it is on the car and then I think

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.509 
how it is on the car and then I think
they're<00:04:15.150> going<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.480> erase<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:16.680> there's

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
they're going to erase if there's

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.740 
they're going to erase if there's
actually<00:04:17.730> any<00:04:17.760> race<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.390> don't<00:04:18.510> think<00:04:18.630> I've<00:04:18.720> got

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
actually any race I don't think I've got

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.500 
actually any race I don't think I've got
any<00:04:18.930> race<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.590> do<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.730> I'm<00:04:20.880> sure<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.239> can<00:04:21.359> find

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
any race to do but I'm sure we can find

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.680 
any race to do but I'm sure we can find
something<00:04:22.550> okay<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.419> year's

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
something okay so this is the year's

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.310 
something okay so this is the year's
yeah<00:04:24.900> how<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.140> car<00:04:25.440> looks

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
yeah how the car looks

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.420 
yeah how the car looks
I<00:04:26.350> guess<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.590> was<00:04:26.680> kind<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:26.890> worth<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.280> mean

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
I guess it was kind of worth it I mean

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.040 
I guess it was kind of worth it I mean
it's<00:04:27.610> got<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.820> coalescence<00:04:28.300> silver-black

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
it's got the coalescence silver-black

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.080 
it's got the coalescence silver-black
that's<00:04:29.830> obviously<00:04:30.130> got<00:04:30.220> all<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.610> finals

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
that's obviously got all of the finals

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.530 
that's obviously got all of the finals
in<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.450> car<00:04:31.920> side<00:04:32.920> vinyls<00:04:33.640> and<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.150> kind<00:04:34.480> of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
in this car side vinyls and it's kind of

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.990 
in this car side vinyls and it's kind of
pretty<00:04:34.990> sick<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.340> I've<00:04:36.460> came<00:04:36.670> across<00:04:36.910> a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
pretty sick but I've came across a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.210 
pretty sick but I've came across a
problem<00:04:37.270> there's<00:04:37.600> no<00:04:37.660> all<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.110> races<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.190> I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
problem there's no all of races so I

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.280 
problem there's no all of races so I
think<00:04:39.340> I'm<00:04:39.520> gonna<00:04:39.610> have<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:40.110> improvise

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
think I'm gonna have to improvise

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.290 
think I'm gonna have to improvise
really<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.520> oh<00:04:42.760> no<00:04:44.280> it's<00:04:45.280> four<00:04:45.460> wheel<00:04:45.640> drive<00:04:45.910> so

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
really so oh no it's four wheel drive so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.630 
really so oh no it's four wheel drive so
don't<00:04:46.780> expect<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.320> be<00:04:47.410> anyway<00:04:47.860> I'm<00:04:48.460> gonna

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
don't expect it to be anyway I'm gonna

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.850 
don't expect it to be anyway I'm gonna
go<00:04:48.730> wanna<00:04:49.180> race<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.810> then<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.020> guess<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.590> would

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
go wanna race and then I guess I would

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.170 
go wanna race and then I guess I would
be<00:04:50.890> right

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
be right

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.740 
be right
actually<00:04:52.810> no<00:04:53.110> I'm<00:04:53.380> not<00:04:53.730> right<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.150> if<00:04:55.570> you

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
actually no I'm not right to that if you

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.060 
actually no I'm not right to that if you
can<00:04:55.870> get<00:04:55.990> behind<00:04:56.110> one<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.500> these<00:04:56.620> cars

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
can get behind one of these cars

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.740 
can get behind one of these cars
I<00:04:57.160> believe<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.670> can<00:04:57.850> still<00:04:58.060> race<00:04:58.210> anyway<00:04:58.690> so

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
I believe you can still race anyway so

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.400 
I believe you can still race anyway so
okay<00:04:59.370> so<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:01.120> isn't<00:05:01.450> really<00:05:01.780> gonna<00:05:01.960> be<00:05:02.080> much

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
okay so this isn't really gonna be much

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.300 
okay so this isn't really gonna be much
of<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.710> race<00:05:02.950> but<00:05:03.870> it's<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:04.960> race<00:05:05.140> nonetheless<00:05:05.410> so

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
of a race but it's a race nonetheless so

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.620 
of a race but it's a race nonetheless so
it's<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.270> Mazda<00:05:07.690> versus<00:05:08.200> an<00:05:08.320> r1<00:05:08.920> skyline<00:05:09.880> I'm<00:05:10.390> so

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
it's a Mazda versus an r1 skyline I'm so

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.360 
it's a Mazda versus an r1 skyline I'm so
sorry<00:05:10.930> about<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.140> but<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:12.220> know<00:05:12.340> maybe
