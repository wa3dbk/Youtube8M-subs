00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay this is very quick tutorial what I

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.100 
okay this is very quick tutorial what I
want<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> cover<00:00:03.000> in<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.210> tutorial<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.780> is

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
want to cover in this tutorial is is

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.900 
want to cover in this tutorial is is
just<00:00:04.410> sorting<00:00:04.710> out<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.920> cat<00:00:05.130> rig<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:05.700> that

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
just sorting out the cat rig so that

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.780 
just sorting out the cat rig so that
it's<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.810> bit<00:00:06.960> easier<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.379> work<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.670> so<00:00:08.670> for

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it's a bit easier to work with so for

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.410 
it's a bit easier to work with so for
example<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.360> 3ds<00:00:09.929> Max<00:00:10.170> 2014<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:11.910> now<00:00:12.150> move

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
example in 3ds Max 2014 you can now move

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.169 
example in 3ds Max 2014 you can now move
the<00:00:12.809> foot<00:00:13.349> bone<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.460> used<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.000> that

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the foot bone so it used to be that that

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
the foot bone so it used to be that that
was<00:00:15.360> locked<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.320> only<00:00:16.440> way<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.619> move<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
was locked and the only way to move the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.380 
was locked and the only way to move the
leg<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.940> through<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.600> can't<00:00:19.109> roller<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
leg was through the I can't roller and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
leg was through the I can't roller and
what<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:21.480> gonna<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.949> select<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
what I'm gonna do is just select the the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070 
what I'm gonna do is just select the the
foot<00:00:24.420> bones<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:26.420> I'm<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> come<00:00:27.750> over<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
foot bones and I'm going to come over to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.640 
foot bones and I'm going to come over to
the<00:00:29.060> hierarchy<00:00:30.060> tab<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> link

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the hierarchy tab and go into the link

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.130 
the hierarchy tab and go into the link
info<00:00:32.009> section<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> lock

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
info section and I'm just going to lock

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
info section and I'm just going to lock
the<00:00:34.680> move<00:00:35.630> XYZ<00:00:37.579> axes<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.890> can<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.070> no<00:00:41.520> longer

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the move XYZ axes so I can now no longer

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
the move XYZ axes so I can now no longer
actually<00:00:42.180> move<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.809> foot<00:00:43.079> bones<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> can

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
actually move those foot bones so I can

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
actually move those foot bones so I can
still<00:00:44.399> move<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.640> foot<00:00:44.940> platforms<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.960> not

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
still move the foot platforms but not

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
still move the foot platforms but not
the<00:00:46.289> bones<00:00:46.469> themselves<00:00:48.739> moving<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.860> I'm<00:00:50.010> just

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the bones themselves moving on I'm just

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.029 
the bones themselves moving on I'm just
going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.850> something<00:00:51.059> similar<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
going to do something similar with the

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.450 
going to do something similar with the
forum<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.309> forum<00:00:53.550> should<00:00:53.879> never<00:00:54.180> rotate<00:00:55.460> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
forum the forum should never rotate on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360 
forum the forum should never rotate on
some<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> these<00:00:57.059> axes<00:00:57.649> ideally<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.039> forum

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
some of these axes ideally the the forum

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.360 
some of these axes ideally the the forum
should<00:00:59.520> only<00:00:59.699> rotate<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> local<00:01:00.960> z-axis<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
should only rotate on a local z-axis so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
should only rotate on a local z-axis so
what<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.660> select<00:01:03.780> both

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
what I'm going to do is select both

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
what I'm going to do is select both
forums<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.280> gonna<00:01:05.430> lock<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> X<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
forums and I'm gonna lock the the X and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.950 
forums and I'm gonna lock the the X and
the<00:01:07.470> y<00:01:07.650> axes<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.810> you're

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the y axes out so that when you're

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.929 
the y axes out so that when you're
animating<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.220> can't<00:01:11.460> no<00:01:11.790> matter

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
animating you you just can't no matter

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.200 
animating you you just can't no matter
how<00:01:12.119> much<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.450> try<00:01:12.630> there's<00:01:13.020> no<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:14.210> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
how much you try there's no way to to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
how much you try there's no way to to
rotate<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.080> an<00:01:16.170> axes<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:16.619> shouldn't

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
rotate these on an axes they shouldn't

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
rotate these on an axes they shouldn't
rotate<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.439> for

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
rotate on and we can also do this for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.999 
rotate on and we can also do this for
the<00:01:20.360> fingers<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.380> take<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the fingers as well so if I take all of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.820 
the fingers as well so if I take all of
these<00:01:23.220> finger<00:01:23.610> bones<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.060> hand<00:01:24.240> bones<00:01:24.450> just

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
these finger bones and hand bones just

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
these finger bones and hand bones just
get<00:01:25.830> rid<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.640> hand<00:01:26.880> bones<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.540> I'm

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
get rid of the the hand bones and I'm

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
get rid of the the hand bones and I'm
also<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.829> take<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.280> from<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
also going to just take out from the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.620 
also going to just take out from the
selection<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.439> first<00:01:31.439> finger<00:01:32.299> bones<00:01:33.299> in

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
selection the first finger bones in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.359 
selection the first finger bones in
those<00:01:34.350> segments<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.610> those<00:01:36.380> sections<00:01:37.380> even

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
those segments in those sections even

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.920 
those segments in those sections even
and<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.600> take

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and what I'm going to do is just take

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.770 
and what I'm going to do is just take
out<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> lock<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.600> X

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
out the I'm just going to lock the the X

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.249 
out the I'm just going to lock the the X
and<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> y<00:01:43.820> rotations<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.720> these<00:01:45.840> bones<00:01:46.049> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and the y rotations so these bones can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
and the y rotations so these bones can
only<00:01:46.409> rotate<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.970> real<00:01:48.119> life

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
only rotate how they would in real life

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
only rotate how they would in real life
now<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.020> can't<00:01:49.290> rotate<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.920> any<00:01:50.100> other

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
now like they can't rotate on any other

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
now like they can't rotate on any other
axes<00:01:52.820> obviously<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.750> first

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
axes obviously you want the the first

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.319 
axes obviously you want the the first
bones<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.009> still<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.369> able<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> rotate<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
bones to to still be able to rotate and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.719 
bones to to still be able to rotate and
other<00:01:57.450> axes<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.680> things<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:58.920> spread<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
other axes for things like spread and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.290 
other axes for things like spread and
rotation<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.110> thing
