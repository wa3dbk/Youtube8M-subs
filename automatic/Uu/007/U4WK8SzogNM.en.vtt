00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.099
 in this video a bit special because 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.320
 that I have an ad to make an announcement 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.610
 of importance that this case where it's 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.980
 francois who receives the message on 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 facebook a bit back to basics with 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.359
 arthur on that same seat that there are two 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.010
 years soon two years we had 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.560
 started issuing larry king who 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 play live in announcement to make by 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.380
 report to youtube and dailymotion 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 since we will go from youtube to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 dailymotion 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.500
 so in fact all those who follow me 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 on youtube will have to come follow me 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 on dailymotion so why have 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.360
 chose dailymotion com new 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 low video platform for many 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.710
 reasons the most important first 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.879
 we have access to the functionality 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 live stream of live 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.600
 oh no kidding had said blake 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 because we are in full filming a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.620
 unnecessary shipping and we expect the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.570
 pro bg to turn meanwhile it's 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 so here I go on and we chose that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020
 to make the live because we got 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 launched in the stream since mr pandaria 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.830
 and here we would like to extend this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 stream function with maybe 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 other francophone guilds you go 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 maybe see some pretty well- known guides and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 even of the top French speakers who go 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.909
 join with grandma kling to spread 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.320
 live events and raids and c is 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 so that was really the choice that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 pushed us to go on dailymotion 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 but also other stuff because 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.689
 through dailymotion 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.310
 instead of just granny twink 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 on one channel we will have a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.570
 sort of two networks or warcraft with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 lots of little video creators do not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.170
 can not he big little ones 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.780
 creators of videos that are going to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.649
 find on our channel dailymotion 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 kevin rock out godoffe macro and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.920
 else we are in the process of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 respect and from there we go 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 to be able to develop a real web that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.470
 lives on the showcase points as if in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 development where you can comment 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.150
 watch again share your videos 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.690
 favorite so here it was an announcement 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.010
 to tell you that we are leaving 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.680
 youtube it's a little nostalgic it's me 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.450
 reminds the beginnings of the show for 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.750
 go on dailymotion but it's a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.550
 new adventure that starts and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.510
 will continue well with what she believes 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.100
 always make videos 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.810
 that does not mean we'll stop 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.430
 but on the contrary we are going 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.110
 continue so we end up on 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.180
 dailymotion and on mamy of a pump 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.580
 as for all other ads to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.580
 very soon and in good game in Dari
