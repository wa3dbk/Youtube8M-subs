00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
it was so much fun they changed

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.290

everything<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.430> didn't<00:01:01.910> help<00:01:02.059> anything

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
everything so that didn't help anything

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.670 
everything so that didn't help anything
I<00:01:02.480> thought<00:01:02.629> researching<00:01:03.110> would<00:01:03.230> be<00:01:03.320> easy<00:01:03.530> but

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
I thought researching would be easy but

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.620 
I thought researching would be easy but
without<00:01:04.460> ever<00:01:04.670> five<00:01:04.879> years<00:01:05.089> they<00:01:05.210> change<00:01:05.449> it

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
without ever five years they change it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.150 
without ever five years they change it
and<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:05.870> got<00:01:06.050> stuck<00:01:06.290> on<00:01:06.410> one<00:01:06.620> year<00:01:06.860> where<00:01:07.070> they

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160
