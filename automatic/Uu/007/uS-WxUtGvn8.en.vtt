00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.109
 today nobody leaves here without learning 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.259
 the distinction between an onion 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.290
 caramelized and a candied onion what 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.630
 difference people what mistakes a 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.750
 onion let's turn on the first 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.860
 fire to see let's light it here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.860
 let's light here 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.230
 let's light here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.079
 great 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.460
 look at the candied onion is a 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.960
 onion is done only you see with 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.690
 this to salt oil and onion we throw the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.940
 onion we can start from a little 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.050
 hot oil if nothing happens these 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.330
 covered is covered with a little salt 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.879
 and it is covered with oil then we drain 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.970
 that we spare us the worth and 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.159
 cover very very slowly and we're going to 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.740
 have about three quarters of 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.190
 you see 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.110
 and the caramelized onion is something else 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.200
 it's an onion that was a bit 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.610
 crispy has another color because because 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.650
 know a little bit of need because we have 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.440
 made with sugar I'll show you a 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.810
 trick to make it look great 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.390
 let's put a background 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:28.030
 of oil let's take the onion this 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.570
 it's an onion and for an onion we're going to 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.830
 take quantity of sugar about 4 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.410
 teaspoons of sugar we throw 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.450
 you will see how rich it is to have this as a 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.450
 more ingredient for our salads 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.030
 look how rich then we put the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 oil 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 the sugar 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.740
 came 16 if you do not have nothing happens you can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.620
 put red wine what is important is 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.300
 dye to then facilitate the color 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.710
 of the caramelized onion we left a 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.810
 very nice color and then we're going to throw you 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 water you see is already 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.280
 approximately you see also that it is 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.810
 they are covered now let's leave 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.180
 three quarters of an hour the two on fire 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 shortly and you will see what results so 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.140
 we are going to use different 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.560
 for some salads or for other 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.260
 but to have you as background of 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.660
 not from a closet but from a refrigerator pantry 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.220
 that you just have to learn 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.690
 we have to have we have to start 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.030
 cook with new ingredients 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.770
 very easy very cheap ingredients that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.470
 They make us a lot easier when it comes to making 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.010
 with a good kitchen wait for a 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.799
 momentarily and we see each other now 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.739
 look how impressive the difference 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.629
 you see the caramelized onion as its 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.970
 name indicates it looks like a candy 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.709
 Onion will serve us very well for 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.079
 all that are warm salads 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.319
 made with goat cheese made with 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.299
 fachas with duck mother and this one that 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.610
 is the candied onion to which 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.440
 only we have done in oil is going to be 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.200
 much more versatile because why not 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.940
 have sugar we will put with any 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.739
 with any lettuce with things 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.420
 unthinkable you to yours 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.579
 salad as a salad and lettuce 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.250
 rice to put your candied beauty 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.569
 will give a lot of softness a lot of harmony to 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.640
 Salad 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.340
 how are we going to keep it then look 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.159
 as you can see the candy is going to 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.459
 keep much better I recommend 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.950
 Here I have two small boats that we can 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.829
 put in two boats quietly and the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.319
 fridge the caramelised category os 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.389
 hold on but we go more than a month the other 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.760
 a little less always goes out island 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.739
 spending before but it suits very well 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.379
 because what I tell you is interesting to have 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.079
 always ingredients already made then the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.900
 kitchen is much simpler and yes that 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.060
 it is with last longer this we could what 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.459
 it is called in voting that is to put in boats 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.859
 and cook if you know it for 20 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.199
 minutes simply to a bain- marie with 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.230
 water with plenty of water well closed 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:09.019
 so you do not get stuck in months if 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.449
 you have a caramelized onion for months 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.519
 a caramelized onion the same for 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:16.009
 give away what a beautiful detail then 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.989
 in another beautiful jar to give to 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.329
 some friends of ours to someone who 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.060
 like the kitchen a lot are details that 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.400
 you should not miss this anymore 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.650
 I'm waiting for you this morning and I hope that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.030
 you are here with me always very attentive 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.310
 learning new things 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.669
 I learn things much more than green 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.889
 learning that salads are a 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.990
 wide very versatile dish on the horn 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.110
 ok we can make first courses 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.430
 second courses or unique dishes good 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.430
 until tomorrow and do not fail me
