00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello everyone today we set about 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 picking our tomato seedlings and first 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.750
 For comparison, I want to show you 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.539
 here is the seedlings that we planted in the usual 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.240
 ground with a milk pack and so 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.160
 looks like a seedling that grew in 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.220
 peat tablets I think that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240
 the difference is obvious 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.099
 seedlings can be transplanted into 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
 individual pot after appearing 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.890
 one two true leaves as 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 rule this happens on day 20 after 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.810
 planting as seedling pots 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.850
 we will use regular packages 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:43.950
 from milk usually such liter 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.950
 we cut off the top we wash away from residues 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.650
 product and a little dry and on 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.460
 in the fourth part we fill them 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.460
 uppercut 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.200
 after the sawdust we pour your land 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.570
 nutrient primer 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.570
 2-3 centimeters poured 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 next we take seedlings 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.310
 Now we will sit exactly those 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.600
 who grew up in peat 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.250
 pots first we remove from 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.250
 pills this protective film 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.890
 careful not to hurt 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.470
 root and by the way some do not take off 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.290
 but because roots go very well 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.940
 through this rag 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.780
 after removing the protective shell 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.240
 tomatoes can be planted 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.880
 land but plant the fruit is not so here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.160
 here here is the land and about two 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.860
 third bury his land ie here 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.869
 to have the surface of the earth but 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.290
 cotyledon leaves should be left 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.150
 above and below in the ground will 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.950
 form additional code here 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.350
 See what happens is put in the package 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.410
 Well, about the need to estimate the height 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.090
 so that it does not rise high and not low 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.940
 little clouds 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:23.010
 or fall asleep fertile ground stalk 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.580
 falls asleep almost all leave 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.550
 only lower cotyledon leaves on 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.739
 air all to get 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.330
 extra roots 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.980
 ramming need to ram not need 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.080
 when we water 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.400
 the earth itself will sit down with water and a 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.400
 drags the roots 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.190
 pour water with potassium permanganate in order 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.010
 to kill some germs and bacteria 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.920
 in the ground and also water with potassium permanganate 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.410
 serve as an additional fertilizer but 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.650
 sawdust used to here 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.840
 now i'm pouring some excess moisture 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.800
 here it goes down and stays in 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.860
 api well, this is a kind of drainage layer 1 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.850
 Well, at the same time, saving say so 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.709
 two lands 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.060
 below porridge will not form a 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.550
 We are now starting a dive 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.540
 seedlings that grow in our packages 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.000
 from milk 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.920
 so in order not to damage the roots 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.920
 here first need to water 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.730
 soak winters once but not needed much 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:45.380
 macerate so she doesn't swim out after 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:50.530
 this we take the cut package move aside 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.530
 wall here 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.690
 reach a ball out take out this tip he 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.030
 business 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.690
 neatly so as not to damage the roots here 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.430
 have divided 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.450
 unfold it is not necessary here 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.430
 how was he of the earth so it remains 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.169
 it turns out almost the same peat 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.199
 chicken bag a smaller form 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.639
 here further this stake we are about 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.970
 measure it so that this tomato is completely 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.760
 there did not fall to the bottom of pouring land 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.639
 How much do I need to go on? 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.870
 neatly see the bottom of the paper should 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:40.030
 be at or above the edge 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:44.210
 even as a package and on as neatly 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:48.110
 we fall asleep here we fall asleep again leaving 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.690
 cotyledon leaves and above the ground there on 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.669
 one or two centimeters can reach 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.850
 themselves analyst sheet should be put a 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.130
 when we will transplant already in the greenhouse in 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.680
 main soil to a permanent place there 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.639
 we are already catching these dependencies 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.330
 from what will be a long stem 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:12.220
 watering also with potassium permanganate and set 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:17.289
 sunny window the whole earth was wet 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.289
 drenched now she's all going down and 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.349
 after the first landing miracle watering there 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.419
 2-3 days by the way no and drainage 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.599
 holes in the pot in a milk bag 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.220
 we don't do all the moisture we have 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.900
 will collect a layer of sawdust 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.180
 if we make drainage holes then 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.310
 Of course there will be problems for ourselves 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.110
 more on dirty windowsill 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.200
 it will be necessary to substitute 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.470
 some saucer or something 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:50.349
 so no holes exactly replacing everything 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.349
 you are a layer of sawdust and here sign a grade 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.100
 the package is aspected by seedlings would leave 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.050
 on the window you previously booked 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:11.800
 foil sill still worth it 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:13.720
 take care we use the liter package and 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.680
 because we mostly tall 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:21.510
 varieties and planting in them we are no longer their 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.190
 we touch up to transplanting to the greenhouse 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.220
 once transplanting transplant only 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.910
 already on a permanent place so if u 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.979
 you suddenly 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:35.380
 low-growing varieties please use 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.250
 tare smaller or just cut it 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.979
 a little lower 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.870
 for saving the earth if you drew 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.229
 attention in some packages we sit 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.419
 2 stalks each, this is no special 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.470
 technologies are simply made of savings 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.750
 places of the earth 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:55.060
 as for pepper picks to him 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.310
 let's start later when they are still 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.050
 a little older technology all the same 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.669
 most easy will use tara 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.300
 a little less about this size 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.860
 cups or the secondary can be washed 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.229
 yogurt cup in too 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.120
 perfect thing is that 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.720
 pepper is not as developed root system 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.510
 like tomato tomatoes so here 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.389
 there will be enough of such a volume 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.180
 quite all thanks for your attention and to 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.680
 new meetings of my new videos good luck to you 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.680
 plant transplant
