can use these wild cards for two more

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.740 
can use these wild cards for two more
I'm<00:03:11.410> short<00:03:11.829> three<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.910> fortress<00:03:13.359> holds<00:03:13.660> out

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
I'm short three the fortress holds out

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.880 
I'm short three the fortress holds out
against<00:03:14.139> this<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.410> don't<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:14.980> okay<00:03:15.880> so

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
against this we don't get it okay so

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.190 
against this we don't get it okay so
discard<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.270> then<00:03:19.660> we<00:03:19.750> go<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.050> next

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
discard that and then we go to the next

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.170 
discard that and then we go to the next
phase<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.490> it's<00:03:21.700> really<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.090> simple

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
phase so so it's really a simple

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.340 
phase so so it's really a simple
mechanic<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:24.390> tension<00:03:25.390> comes<00:03:25.840> with<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
mechanic the tension comes with the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.590 
mechanic the tension comes with the
captain<00:03:26.530> makes<00:03:26.860> three<00:03:27.160> decisions<00:03:27.490> one<00:03:28.060> who

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.890 
going to sail and at the end the captain
can<00:03:32.770> assign<00:03:33.040> punishment<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.850> can<00:03:34.030> say<00:03:34.270> you

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
can assign punishment you can say you

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.750 
can assign punishment you can say you

let's pretend that we had been
successful<00:04:50.650> for<00:04:50.680> example<00:04:51.220> capturing<00:04:51.700> this

successful for example capturing this

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.200 
successful for example capturing this
fort<00:04:52.120> we<00:04:52.270> draw<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.570> top<00:04:52.810> five<00:04:53.080> cards<00:04:53.940> as<00:04:54.940> the

captain i would get first pick and so I

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.070 
captain i would get first pick and so I

you took yes face this okay and then I

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.130 
you took yes face this okay and then I
give<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.610> rest<00:05:03.789> of<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.060> quartermaster<00:05:04.690> who

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
divides the cards is cards not the value

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.390 
divides the cards is cards not the value
as<00:05:08.020> equally<00:05:08.530> as<00:05:08.650> he<00:05:08.919> can

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
as equally as he can

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.790 
as equally as he can
so<00:05:10.150> if<00:05:10.270> there's<00:05:10.750> two<00:05:10.960> other<00:05:11.139> people<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
terms of victory points but good in the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.469

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
the choice exactly because if someone

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.029 
the choice exactly because if someone

hand to card pause is what we're doing

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.520 
hand to card pause is what we're doing
and<00:05:38.350> we<00:05:38.500> use<00:05:38.710> our<00:05:38.860> crewmen<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.729> determine<00:05:40.630> who

lot of tension in the game in terms of

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.320 
lot of tension in the game in terms of

how you actually use your cards at some

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.640 
how you actually use your cards at some
point<00:05:52.539> you'll<00:05:52.690> run<00:05:52.870> out<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:53.050> cards<00:05:53.350> so<00:05:53.620> you

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
point you'll run out of cards so you
