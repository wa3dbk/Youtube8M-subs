00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 for me 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.930
 hi how about my name is raquel 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.769
 I live here in the city of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.660
 oklahoma city ​​and I think a little bit 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.700
 time came don cheto at the inauguration 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.369
 from a store that was the artist 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.289
 principal since I already when he was here and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.480
 I was singing in cheto and like who 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 he says it was my turn to open his concert because 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.900
 it looked like he was Luis Miguel 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.199
 here with all of you people talk a little 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 that concert that by the way is very 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.239
 valuable to sing with a sea that is going 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.370
 but no more concert is given 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 music the apprentice allowed my uncle 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.329
 Javier when I was five years old 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.579

 I never wanted to be in Miami 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.680
