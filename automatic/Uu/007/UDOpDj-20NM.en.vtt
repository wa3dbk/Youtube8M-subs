00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
tactical game is that's really an

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.890 
tactical game is that's really an
interesting<00:03:15.280> tool<00:03:15.489> first<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.329> all<00:03:16.420> one<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
interesting tool first of all one of the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900 
interesting tool first of all one of the
very<00:03:17.140> big<00:03:17.350> improvements<00:03:17.950> over<00:03:18.010> Vegas<00:03:18.549> one<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
very big improvements over Vegas one is

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.280 
very big improvements over Vegas one is
the<00:03:19.030> fact<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> game<00:03:19.660> looks<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.019> lot

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
the fact that the game looks a lot

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.860 
the fact that the game looks a lot
better<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:21.549> sounds<00:03:21.850> very<00:03:21.880> superficial<00:03:22.720> but

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
better this sounds very superficial but

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.600 
better this sounds very superficial but
we<00:03:22.989> have<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> shadow<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.650> more<00:03:23.950> memory<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.370> play

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
we have a shadow up more memory to play

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.699 
we have a shadow up more memory to play
with<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.030> game<00:03:25.180> looks<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.480> lot<00:03:25.570> better<00:03:25.780> also

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
with so the game looks a lot better also

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.440 
with so the game looks a lot better also
we<00:03:26.890> worked<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.280> lot<00:03:27.519> more<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.910> story<00:03:28.000> it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
we worked a lot more on the story it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.240 
we worked a lot more on the story it
feels<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.810> lot<00:03:29.019> more<00:03:29.079> realistic<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:30.040> time

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
feels a lot more realistic this time

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.220 
feels a lot more realistic this time
around<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.940> story<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.329> Vegas<00:03:31.690> felt<00:03:31.959> like<00:03:32.140> it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
around the story on Vegas felt like it

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.020 
around the story on Vegas felt like it
was<00:03:32.320> very<00:03:32.380> interesting<00:03:33.040> but<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.549> kind<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:33.820> felt

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
was very interesting but it kind of felt

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.729 
was very interesting but it kind of felt
like<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.239> was<00:03:34.329> going<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.140> were<00:03:35.260> sort

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
like it was going on and you were sort

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.890 
like it was going on and you were sort

in the story you're going to be
alongside<00:03:42.820> them<00:03:43.269> at<00:03:43.420> times<00:03:43.630> you'll<00:03:44.110> even<00:03:44.320> see

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
alongside them at times you'll even see

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.289 
alongside them at times you'll even see
the<00:03:44.650> rain<00:03:44.829> another<00:03:45.220> part<00:03:45.579> of<00:03:45.640> rainbow<00:03:46.060> that's

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
the rain another part of rainbow that's

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.680 
going to be in a mission with you so
there's<00:03:48.130> all<00:03:48.310> these<00:03:48.430> npcs<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.450> all<00:03:49.570> these

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
people it feels very alive and very

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.910 
people it feels very alive and very
interactive<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> story<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.260> not

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
interactive so the story is not

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.680 
interactive so the story is not
necessarily<00:03:54.370> darker<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:55.299> it's<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.510> lot<00:03:55.660> more

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
necessarily darker but it's a lot more

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.569

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
emotional you're going to care a lot

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.520 
emotional you're going to care a lot
more<00:03:57.820> about<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.120> hostages<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.840> situations

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
more about the hostages the situations

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.380 
more about the hostages the situations
are<00:03:59.680> really<00:04:00.010> going<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.579> make<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.880> understand

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
are really going to make you understand

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.509

how<00:04:01.750> serious<00:04:01.950> everything<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.100> in<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> game

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
how serious everything is in the game

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.030 
how serious everything is in the game
the<00:04:04.420> game<00:04:04.540> will<00:04:04.780> last<00:04:04.810> for<00:04:05.230> about<00:04:05.320> 6<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.920> 11

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
the game will last for about 6 to 11

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520 
the game will last for about 6 to 11
hours<00:04:06.430> depending<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> play<00:04:07.329> style<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.930> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
hours depending on the play style of the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.410 
hours depending on the play style of the
person<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.519> vary<00:04:09.790> because<00:04:10.000> we're<00:04:10.269> still

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
person this can vary because we're still

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.150 
person this can vary because we're still
tweaking<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:11.140> little<00:04:11.320> bit<00:04:11.410> difficulty<00:04:12.010> in

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
tweaking a little bit difficulty in

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.280 
tweaking a little bit difficulty in
certain<00:04:12.609> levels<00:04:13.000> but<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.390> game<00:04:13.600> is<00:04:13.780> very<00:04:13.989> long

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
certain levels but the game is very long

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.900 
certain levels but the game is very long
it<00:04:14.530> actually<00:04:14.650> feels<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.190> little<00:04:15.220> bit<00:04:15.670> bigger

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
it actually feels a little bit bigger

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.729 
it actually feels a little bit bigger
than<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.209> first<00:04:16.390> Vegas<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:17.320> game<00:04:17.500> has<00:04:17.620> been

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
than the first Vegas the game has been

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.529 
than the first Vegas the game has been
in<00:04:17.890> development<00:04:18.010> for<00:04:18.430> about<00:04:18.669> 15<00:04:19.060> months<00:04:19.239> now

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
in development for about 15 months now

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.750 
in development for about 15 months now
so<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:20.200> lot<00:04:20.709> more<00:04:20.919> than<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.190> year

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
so a lot more than a year

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.670 
so a lot more than a year
a<00:04:21.790> really<00:04:22.450> exciting<00:04:22.870> project<00:04:23.380> people<00:04:23.560> have

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
a really exciting project people have

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.200 
a really exciting project people have
been<00:04:23.770> working<00:04:24.070> really<00:04:24.280> hard<00:04:24.400> we've<00:04:25.060> had

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
been working really hard we've had

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.730 
been working really hard we've had
really<00:04:25.510> long<00:04:25.690> nights<00:04:25.990> especially<00:04:26.170> recently

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
really long nights especially recently

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.830 
really long nights especially recently
but<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.730> game<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.090> really<00:04:28.330> coming<00:04:28.540> along

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
but the game is really coming along

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.870 
but the game is really coming along
nicely<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:30.070> think<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.610> going<00:04:30.790> to

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
nicely and we think that it's going to

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.500 
nicely and we think that it's going to
be<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> really<00:04:31.600> exciting<00:04:32.080> sequel
