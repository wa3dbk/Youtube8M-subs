00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.530
 okay hello everyone I come one more day to 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.340
 tell you things 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.320
 lately there is a lot of talk about technology 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.480
 comprehensive that is the technology 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.100
 understanding that I come to tell you a 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.619
 little bit what is it for and what can we do 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.779
 expect from her important things from the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.550
 comprehensive technology the first thing 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.770
 what you have to know is that it is born from 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.530
 health sciences that what he raises 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.330
 is to improve blood circulation by 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.730
 so what he raises in the first 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.970
 instance is so remove more 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.830
 easy what would be the lactic acid and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.280
 also get a contribution more 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:53.960
 faster more convenient nutrient 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 sugars and oxygen to our muscle 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.909
 we achieve this thanks to the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.830
 compression agreement but it's not only 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.979
 that what technology raises 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.460
 comprehensive we also get in 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:12.710
 definitive thanks to his pressure 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 on our musculature that at the time 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.909
 of running the impact I made minor 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.540
 very much in a way that does not vibrate our 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.450
 Musculature avoiding injuries or possible 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.550
 injuries things that are noticed then good to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.460
 when using for the first time the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.020
 comprehensive technology obviously you have 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.979
 a different sensations a very 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.710
 important the feeling of noticing more of your 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.759
 body but also that it appears more 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.890
 slow or later the feeling of pain 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.880
 so that we can tighten or give 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.100
 more cane to our activity according 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.200
 that we can find in technology 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.080
 comprehensive basically trunk towards 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.060
 below we can find meshes we can 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.700
 find pants where your interior 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.909
 wears a compression mesh but what 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.869
 more we know 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.850
 are the anklets in short since 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.399
 the ankle up above our 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.069
 twin because it is a kind of cuff 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.620
 in short that compresses that area and 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.260
 that to begin with I think it would be the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.660
 ideal garment start with things like this 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.010
 we are going to notice big differences of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.069
 agreement nothing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.290
 make that a brushstroke of what is 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.660
 the comprehensive technology that I hope that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.700
 serve you and you encourage yourself because that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 approve it because it really marks the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.830
 difference of agreement come see you 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.900
 until another video 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.900
 to run around come on until later
