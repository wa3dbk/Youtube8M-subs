00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.550 
can see I can actually zoom in a little
bit<00:00:28.560> further<00:00:29.150> with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.419> this<00:00:31.019> camera<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
bit further with the this camera that I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.410 
bit further with the this camera that I
could<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:31.980> studio<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> studio

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
could in my studio the one in the studio

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
could in my studio the one in the studio
is<00:00:33.540> controlled<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.290> iMac<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
is controlled by my iMac and because the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
is controlled by my iMac and because the
iMac<00:00:36.390> has<00:00:36.420> its<00:00:36.870> own<00:00:37.050> camera<00:00:37.380> I've<00:00:38.100> never<00:00:38.400> been

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
so the blog video which this is being

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.210 
so the blog video which this is being
shot<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> camera<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.560> will<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
shot with the camera that will be on the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.210 
shot with the camera that will be on the
blog<00:00:47.840> could<00:00:48.840> never<00:00:49.080> quite<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.430> full

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
blog could never quite get the full

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.000 
blog could never quite get the full
zoomed<00:00:53.220> in<00:00:53.430> action<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.990> I'll<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.650> working<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
zoomed in action so I'll be working a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.190 
zoomed in action so I'll be working a
little<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.430> often<00:00:56.880> from<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> house<00:00:57.720> and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
little bit more often from the house and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.420 
little bit more often from the house and
from<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> studio<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.750> I'll<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.960> online<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.830> my

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

I'm probably will be working a little

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.200 
I'm probably will be working a little
bit<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.280> because<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.939> gonna<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.150> as

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
bit more because it's not gonna be as

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
bit more because it's not gonna be as
hard<00:01:09.420> getting<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> studio<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:11.460> know

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
hard getting to the studio as you know

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990 
hard getting to the studio as you know
where<00:01:11.700> time<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.300> has<00:01:12.480> been<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.370> I<00:01:14.370> can<00:01:14.850> work

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
where time as it has been and I can work

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 
where time as it has been and I can work
just<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.450> any<00:01:15.690> time<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.050> feel<00:01:16.260> like<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.470> can

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
just about any time I feel like I can

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.020 
just about any time I feel like I can
get<00:01:16.800> up<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.010> 4<00:01:17.250> o'clock<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> morning<00:01:17.940> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and
work<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.300> I<00:01:18.360> feel<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> without<00:01:19.740> having<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
work if I feel like it without having to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
work if I feel like it without having to
get<00:01:20.400> dressed<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.659> warmed<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.230> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
get dressed and get warmed up the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.820 
get dressed and get warmed up the
vehicle<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.190> warming<00:01:23.730> up<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> studio<00:01:24.300> and

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
vehicle and warming up the studio and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.470 
vehicle and warming up the studio and
working<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.090> gonna<00:01:27.210> work

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
working there so I think it's gonna work

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.080 
working there so I think it's gonna work
out<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.930> fine<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.440> got<00:01:28.740> cloth<00:01:29.490> background

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
out this fine I got cloth background

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.260 
out this fine I got cloth background
just<00:01:30.300> so<00:01:30.480> that<00:01:30.630> things<00:01:30.990> are<00:01:31.110> less<00:01:31.320> confusing

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
just so that things are less confusing

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.230 
just so that things are less confusing
when<00:01:33.270> people<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.900> looking<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.409> videos<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
when people are looking at my videos and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.070 
when people are looking at my videos and
we'll<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.510> from<00:01:36.659> there

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
we'll just go from there

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.340 
we'll just go from there
all<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:38.810> it's<00:01:39.810> gonna<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:39.990> fun
