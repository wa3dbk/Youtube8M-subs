00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.970
 the child to everyone whom today extracts a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 video about tweets in special top 5 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 tweets but this is not the typical top 5 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.460
 that I take the first 5 of rogue and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 some video if it's not 5 of me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 it seems that they are the best for them 7 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 at this time and well I hope that you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.580
 like the video and especially because I know 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.129
 that tweets is what you visit the most 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.750
 get on my channel and also the worst is 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.340
 that they took a video of 50 thousand 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.820
 visits because he was supposed to have 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.149
 Fraudulent content but not and good 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.480
 let's enter in the video the first tweet of 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.270
 I want to talk to you is intel and screen x 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.300
 for ios 7 is that it is a bit difficult to 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 pronounce and well this tweet what we 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.469
 allows then it is to have 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 notifications and a center 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.220
 notifications redesigned since then 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.050
 we have a home with time the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.119
 normal notifications and then we have 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.149
 small sub-sections on the right of 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 twitter facebook rss feed 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.180
 and well if we press them we can see 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.170
 perfectly all our 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.540
 notifications of these social networks 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.759
 and also one function that we have is that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.320
 if we drag from it from above 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.750
 down the left then we have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.970
 a kind of multi tasking and good 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.320
 this multi tasking takes the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.210
 applications of which we already have 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.289
 open are not customizable that I 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.310
 know and good as you can see it 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.380
 upload and download notifications 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.820
 perfectly and also in the networks 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 social and the messages there are several 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.380
 options how to write messages 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.250
 answer etc and then we also have the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.080
 notification center version 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.730
 As you can see we have above 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.880
 sections and the multitasking is still there 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.650
 also the truth is that it's a tweet that 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 I find it super complete and that the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.850
 news has optimized very well for it 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.160
 7 the next tweet we're going to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.330
 talk is a quick and very simple tweet 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.440
 jill and the thread 7 this what is is like 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.650
 the unlocking of a nexus or with 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.330
 pure android and then from the settings 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.020
 we can choose the applications that 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.910
 we want to have and very simple and very 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.430
 functional without any doubt then we have 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.560
 a tweet that is maui track data that is me 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.740
 super useful to see how much data I have 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.410
 in the month and well we have several several 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.690
 there were sections to see more information 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.240
 and minor adjustments where as 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.860
 we can flip the bar to 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.300
 that is not what we have spent but what 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.480
 what we have left to say when 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.490
 we started having data in the month or 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.550
 if we just downloaded it how many 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.170
 We are already here so that it is up to date and good 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.290
 the next one we're going to talk about is 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.900
 vertex 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.239
 that redesigns a bit the multitasking and 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.400
 rejoins what has been the 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.859
 multitasking with the control center 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.290
 like the 6 so to speak I was 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.200
 all together but with a much more style 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.939
 Pretty finally talk about espn espn 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.620
 it is a tweet that simply 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.989
 redesign our music controls 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.000
 on the lock screen and as you see 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.099
 it's pretty cool a good design very 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.920
 good features touching by 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.870
 example the photo of the album is for you can 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.630
 go towards mind back good a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.790
 small tweet 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.920
 very functional but more than functional is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.010
 nice and good I hope you have 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.010

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.730
 I hope you liked everything 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.790

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.969
