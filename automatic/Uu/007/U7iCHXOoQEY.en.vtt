00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.430
 take advantage and lower a bit to what 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.430
 it's the floor tom 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.450

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 This is just part of what you to 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.670
 Sometimes they ask me for tuning I like 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 form a melody for example 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.740
 a little tighter the floor tom 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:17.790
 but that sounds excellent to me

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.190
