00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.520
 overview of the car radar detector 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.110
 sho-me str-800 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.090
 the detector is designed to work in all 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:35.210
 known ranges including complex 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:37.100
 speed control arrow stv cables 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.960
 power radar and integrated repeater 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 means when you connect the radar jack 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.909
 cigarette lighter will be free models 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.140
 str-800 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.120
 has three different levels 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.429
 sensitivity low medium and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.649
 high default middle 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.359
 user can choose from three 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.639
 sensitivity levels depending 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.300
 from the situation on the road and the presence of false 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.219
 positives 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.960
 level increase reducing wheel 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.389
 Volume also performs the function 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.159
 turn on and off the radar and therefore 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.570
 to turn off the radar is not necessary 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.909
 pulls the power cord out 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.490
 cigarette lighter reason enough breach 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.430
 and finally the model is equipped with various 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.140
 operating modes city 1 and city 2 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.450
 which turns off the sound 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.000
 alert when triggered to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.280
 and x ranges and data is displayed only 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.210
 on-screen performance indicators 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.649
 similar with all models of the line there and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.840
 make up in the city about 1000 meters 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.899
 Ozone crash and speed control complexes 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.180
 the arrow st is 350 meters so 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.969
 this is more than enough previous 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.609
 tests we tested the work of models 535i 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.600
 545 exactly in this place 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.090
 earned this 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.479
 arrow st is in front of the square 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.930
 Gagarin in the area of ​​37 home is another 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 example 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.110
 third ring inner part but in 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.340
 Andreevsky bridge 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.790
 direction of travel to the side 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.830
 Kutuzov Avenue for the mandate shares 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.440
 makes around eight hundred meters with 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.920
 given that the beginning of the movement was from 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.920
 the tunnel 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.620
 the center of the city is noisy radio 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.569
 a little higher, respectively, and the distance 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.549
 warnings will not 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.620
 large stone bridge movement 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.450
 toward them strikes the theater area 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.930
 Detection was in the area of seven hundred 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.930
 meters 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.439
 we go further 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.959
 trade union movement in the area we 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.709
 drive up the street butlerova complex 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.810
 arrow st 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.879
 established in the metro area belyaev to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.549
 intersection with miklukho-maklaya street 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.349
 the detection zone is already 1100 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.170
 meters but on this our review came up 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.409
 End of all thanks for your attention to the new 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.409
 meeting 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.100
 but
