00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.960 
you'd search the area you know and as
you<00:05:47.890> can<00:05:47.979> see<00:05:48.040> from<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.580> can<00:05:48.790> actually

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
you can see from that you can actually

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.990 
you can see from that you can actually
set<00:05:49.630> by<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.870> club<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:50.790> basically<00:05:51.790> it<00:05:51.880> helps

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
set by the club and basically it helps

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.700 
set by the club and basically it helps
to<00:05:52.240> kill<00:05:52.390> things<00:05:54.240> so<00:05:55.240> let's<00:05:55.720> go<00:05:55.930> without

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
to kill things so let's go without

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.170 
to kill things so let's go without
actually<00:05:57.040> run<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.490> end<00:05:57.640> of<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.790> level<00:05:57.970> now

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
actually run to the end of the level now

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.510 
actually run to the end of the level now
because<00:05:58.510> that<00:05:58.690> is<00:05:58.900> everything<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.890> you<00:06:00.280> can

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
because that is everything that you can

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.580 
because that is everything that you can
do<00:06:00.640> in<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.000> level<00:06:01.330> I'm<00:06:02.020> gonna<00:06:02.200> run<00:06:02.410> up<00:06:02.470> this

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
do in this level I'm gonna run up this

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.430 
do in this level I'm gonna run up this
hill<00:06:02.860> now<00:06:03.460> you<00:06:04.180> can<00:06:04.390> dodge<00:06:04.690> these<00:06:04.900> rocks<00:06:05.229> by

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
hill now you can dodge these rocks by

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.219 
hill now you can dodge these rocks by
jumping<00:06:05.830> right<00:06:06.070> up<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.400> edge<00:06:06.430> just<00:06:06.790> like<00:06:06.910> this

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
jumping right up the edge just like this

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.260 
jumping right up the edge just like this
or<00:06:08.229> you<00:06:08.530> can<00:06:08.650> hold<00:06:08.890> triangle<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.520> block<00:06:10.030> with

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
or you can hold triangle and block with

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.770 
or you can hold triangle and block with
your<00:06:10.419> shield

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
your shield

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.080 
your shield
bite<00:06:11.050> your<00:06:11.260> shield<00:06:11.620> will<00:06:12.010> destroy<00:06:12.460> extremely

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
bite your shield will destroy extremely

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.540 
bite your shield will destroy extremely
quickly<00:06:13.470> when<00:06:14.470> you're<00:06:14.620> blocking<00:06:14.919> these<00:06:15.070> rocks

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
quickly when you're blocking these rocks

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.040 
quickly when you're blocking these rocks
probably<00:06:16.090> it<00:06:16.150> hit<00:06:16.240> like<00:06:16.390> four<00:06:16.630> times<00:06:16.780> and

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
probably it hit like four times and

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.600 
probably it hit like four times and
that's<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.350> as<00:06:17.800> you'll<00:06:18.040> notice<00:06:18.250> I'm<00:06:18.460> not

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
that's it as you'll notice I'm not

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.380 
that's it as you'll notice I'm not
taking<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:18.970> shortcuts

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
taking the shortcuts

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.180 
taking the shortcuts
that's<00:06:20.510> because<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:21.260> just<00:06:21.560> want<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:21.800> like<00:06:21.950> jump

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
that's because I just want to like jump

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.980 
that's because I just want to like jump
up<00:06:22.370> the<00:06:22.550> whole<00:06:22.700> ramp<00:06:22.940> just<00:06:23.210> to<00:06:23.300> show<00:06:23.540> you<00:06:23.600> that

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
up the whole ramp just to show you that

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.590 
up the whole ramp just to show you that
like<00:06:24.230> it<00:06:24.500> is<00:06:24.650> okay<00:06:25.640> it's<00:06:25.970> easier<00:06:26.360> than<00:06:26.480> it

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
like it is okay it's easier than it

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.860 
like it is okay it's easier than it
looks<00:06:26.740> once<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:27.860> get<00:06:27.980> the<00:06:28.040> hang<00:06:28.190> of<00:06:28.280> it<00:06:28.870> you

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
looks once you get the hang of it you

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.810 
looks once you get the hang of it you
know<00:06:30.020> I<00:06:30.290> mean<00:06:30.590> I<00:06:30.860> will<00:06:31.070> get<00:06:31.220> hit<00:06:31.400> a<00:06:31.430> few<00:06:31.640> times

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
know I mean I will get hit a few times

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.940 
know I mean I will get hit a few times
because<00:06:32.120> I'm<00:06:32.270> I'm<00:06:32.540> taking<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.530> whole<00:06:33.680> path

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
because I'm I'm taking the whole path

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.300 
because I'm I'm taking the whole path
but<00:06:35.020> I'm<00:06:36.020> using<00:06:36.260> the<00:06:36.470> method<00:06:36.740> of<00:06:36.800> just<00:06:37.040> jumping

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
but I'm using the method of just jumping

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.530 
but I'm using the method of just jumping
up<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.520> side<00:06:37.730> instead<00:06:37.880> of<00:06:38.120> blocking<00:06:38.210> and

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
up the side instead of blocking and

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.300 
up the side instead of blocking and
actually<00:06:39.320> I'm<00:06:39.440> going<00:06:39.650> to<00:06:39.740> block<00:06:39.890> right<00:06:40.070> here

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
actually I'm going to block right here

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.620 
actually I'm going to block right here
because<00:06:40.490> that<00:06:40.580> chest<00:06:40.910> is<00:06:41.000> right<00:06:41.240> on<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.450> side

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
because that chest is right on the side

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:51.260 
because that chest is right on the side
and<00:06:42.350> I'm<00:06:42.950> gonna<00:06:43.070> get<00:06:43.310> it<00:06:48.220> just<00:06:49.220> like<00:06:49.340> that

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
and I'm gonna get it just like that

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.270 
and I'm gonna get it just like that
because<00:06:51.840> there<00:06:52.020> is<00:06:52.139> actually<00:06:52.440> gold<00:06:52.680> up<00:06:53.009> like

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
because there is actually gold up like

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.950 
because there is actually gold up like
if<00:06:53.430> you<00:06:53.580> take<00:06:53.880> the<00:06:54.000> long<00:06:54.180> part<00:06:54.419> I<00:06:54.630> mean<00:06:54.810> it's

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
if you take the long part I mean it's

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.059 
if you take the long part I mean it's
probably<00:06:55.080> not<00:06:55.259> worth<00:06:55.470> it

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
probably not worth it

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.450 
probably not worth it
not<00:06:56.340> much<00:06:56.550> gold<00:06:56.970> but<00:06:57.919> yeah<00:06:58.919> you<00:06:59.069> can<00:06:59.160> just<00:06:59.220> take

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
not much gold but yeah you can just take

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.100 
not much gold but yeah you can just take
fuel<00:06:59.759> cause<00:06:59.910> if<00:07:00.090> you<00:07:00.180> want<00:07:00.360> and<00:07:01.520> the<00:07:02.520> red<00:07:02.729> rocks

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
fuel cause if you want and the red rocks

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.360 
fuel cause if you want and the red rocks
will<00:07:04.110> actually<00:07:04.470> roll<00:07:04.710> down<00:07:05.509> the<00:07:06.509> UM<00:07:06.889> the<00:07:07.889> steps

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
will actually roll down the UM the steps

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.760 
will actually roll down the UM the steps
see<00:07:08.669> like<00:07:08.970> that<00:07:09.150> and<00:07:09.389> the<00:07:09.780> normal<00:07:10.110> rocks<00:07:10.319> will

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
see like that and the normal rocks will

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:25.149 
see like that and the normal rocks will
go<00:07:11.190> around<00:07:11.370> the<00:07:11.490> whole<00:07:11.610> path<00:07:12.410> so<00:07:14.810> the<00:07:15.810> yeah<00:07:16.080> I
