different commands is a lot of fun the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.760 
different commands is a lot of fun the
movements<00:01:19.210> are<00:01:19.330> pretty<00:01:19.570> sophisticated<00:01:19.720> for<00:01:20.590> a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
movements are pretty sophisticated for a

this gives you your training checklist

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.249 
this gives you your training checklist
the<00:01:30.700> way<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:30.940> works<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.330> push<00:01:31.869> his<00:01:32.020> head

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
the way it works is you push his head

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.779 
the way it works is you push his head
you<00:01:32.530> see<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.800> question<00:01:33.190> marks<00:01:33.399> and<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.610> say

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
you see the question marks and you say

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.020 
you see the question marks and you say
Zoomer<00:01:34.509> sit<00:01:34.869> down<00:01:35.140> Zoomer<00:01:35.770> lay<00:01:36.070> down<00:01:36.340> all<00:01:36.610> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
Zoomer sit down Zoomer lay down all the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.270 
Zoomer sit down Zoomer lay down all the
commands<00:01:37.330> start<00:01:37.479> with<00:01:37.720> Zoomer<00:01:38.320> doesn't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
commands start with Zoomer doesn't

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.620 
commands start with Zoomer doesn't
always<00:01:39.430> get<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.850> right<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.300> guess<00:01:40.450> that's

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
always get it right and I guess that's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.120 
always get it right and I guess that's
part<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.020> fun<00:01:41.229> you're<00:01:41.410> training<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.920> dog

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
part of the fun you're training the dog

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.639 
part of the fun you're training the dog
but<00:01:42.940> after<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.210> while<00:01:43.330> he<00:01:43.390> does<00:01:43.780> start<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.500> get

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
but after a while he does start to get

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.620 
but after a while he does start to get
it<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.280> fun<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.759> even<00:01:46.119> if<00:01:46.210> he<00:01:46.300> doesn't

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
it and it is fun and even if he doesn't

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.150 
it and it is fun and even if he doesn't
get<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.869> right<00:01:47.080> he<00:01:47.320> just<00:01:47.470> runs<00:01:47.710> around<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.100> the

kids are going to like it now he does

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.900 
kids are going to like it now he does
have<00:01:50.590> additional<00:01:51.009> sensors<00:01:51.399> right<00:01:51.610> on<00:01:51.759> his

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
have additional sensors right on his

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.490 
have additional sensors right on his
chest<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.390> these<00:01:52.539> are<00:01:52.720> pretty<00:01:52.899> cool<00:01:53.229> but

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
chest and these are pretty cool but

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.139 
chest and these are pretty cool but
there<00:01:53.950> are<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.039> couple<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.460> different<00:01:54.820> commands

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
there are a couple of different commands

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.910 
there are a couple of different commands
where<00:01:55.390> he's<00:01:55.570> following<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.229> or<00:01:56.470> playing<00:01:56.709> with

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
where he's following you or playing with

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.070 
where he's following you or playing with
a<00:01:56.950> toy<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.520> those<00:01:58.030> sensors<00:01:58.390> can<00:01:58.599> sense<00:01:58.810> what's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
a toy and those sensors can sense what's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.900 
a toy and those sensors can sense what's
next<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.649> and<00:01:59.830> he<00:01:59.920> can<00:02:00.069> react<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.819> if

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
next to it and he can react to it so if

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.130 
next to it and he can react to it so if
you<00:02:00.970> put<00:02:01.119> your<00:02:01.209> hand<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.569> front<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.869> him<00:02:01.990> he'll

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
you put your hand in front of him he'll

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.290 
you put your hand in front of him he'll
react<00:02:02.470> sometimes<00:02:03.190> he<00:02:03.340> goes<00:02:03.490> shooting<00:02:03.880> back<00:02:04.090> as

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
react sometimes he goes shooting back as

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.550 
react sometimes he goes shooting back as
you're<00:02:04.420> gonna<00:02:04.539> see<00:02:04.630> here<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.110> second<00:02:05.470> we'll

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
you're gonna see here in a second we'll

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.410 
you're gonna see here in a second we'll
do<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.709> flick<00:02:06.009> backwards<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.910> additional

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
do a flick backwards so additional

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.029 
do a flick backwards so additional
sensors<00:02:07.810> do<00:02:08.080> bring<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.380> beyond<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.920> voice

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
sensors do bring it beyond just a voice

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.070 
sensors do bring it beyond just a voice
controlled<00:02:09.520> toy<00:02:09.759> allow<00:02:10.420> him<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.660> really<00:02:10.869> move
