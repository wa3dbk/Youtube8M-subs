it's called card debates and in it we're
going<00:00:09.190> to<00:00:09.280> be<00:00:09.429> talking<00:00:10.269> about<00:00:10.660> various<00:00:11.380> cards

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
going to be talking about various cards

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
against and I'm going to take the route

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.990 
against and I'm going to take the route
and<00:00:17.410> stuff<00:00:18.030> so<00:00:19.860> after<00:00:20.860> this<00:00:21.250> video<00:00:21.610> you're

and stuff so after this video you're
going<00:00:22.180> able<00:00:22.510> to<00:00:22.630> comment<00:00:22.930> and<00:00:23.350> stuff<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.980> you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
going able to comment and stuff and you

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200 
going able to comment and stuff and you
get<00:00:24.880> to<00:00:25.060> decide<00:00:25.150> whenever<00:00:25.720> we<00:00:26.320> should<00:00:26.530> use<00:00:26.740> it

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
get to decide whenever we should use it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369 
get to decide whenever we should use it
if<00:00:28.210> another<00:00:28.900> card<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.350> better<00:00:30.330> whatever<00:00:31.379> so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
if another card is better whatever so

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.580 
if another card is better whatever so
let's<00:00:32.589> start<00:00:32.769> things<00:00:32.829> off

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.530 

so<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.310> code<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:39.490> want<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.880> talk<00:00:40.060> about<00:00:40.090> today

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
so the code I want to talk about today

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.720 
so the code I want to talk about today
is<00:00:40.570> scrap<00:00:41.260> iron<00:00:41.470> scarecrow<00:00:41.650> it's<00:00:42.580> a<00:00:42.640> really

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
is scrap iron scarecrow it's a really

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.500 
is scrap iron scarecrow it's a really
simple<00:00:43.030> trap<00:00:43.510> card<00:00:44.610> activate<00:00:45.610> only<00:00:45.850> when<00:00:46.390> the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
simple trap card activate only when the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.210 
simple trap card activate only when the
opponent's<00:00:46.989> monster<00:00:47.380> declares<00:00:47.770> in<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.010> tap

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
opponent's monster declares in the tap

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.940 
opponent's monster declares in the tap
negate<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.210> attack<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.930> set<00:00:50.200> this<00:00:50.350> card<00:00:50.650> face

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
negate the attack and set this card face

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.590 
negate the attack and set this card face
down<00:00:50.980> again<00:00:51.520> instead<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.059> sending<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:52.450> to<00:00:52.570> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
down again instead of sending it to the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
down again instead of sending it to the
graveyard<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:54.190> basically<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:55.720> said<00:00:56.199> your

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
graveyard so basically it said your

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.689 
graveyard so basically it said your
opponent<00:00:57.010> attacks<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.430> get<00:01:00.580> the

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
opponent attacks you and you get the

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.700 
opponent attacks you and you get the
attack<00:01:00.970> with<00:01:01.150> this<00:01:01.330> and<00:01:02.080> you<00:01:02.140> said<00:01:02.379> it<00:01:02.500> back

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
attack with this and you said it back

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
attack with this and you said it back
anything<00:01:03.340> he's<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.730> next<00:01:04.059> turn<00:01:05.910> to<00:01:06.910> me

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
anything he's a next turn to me

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.290 
anything he's a next turn to me
scrap-iron<00:01:08.140> scarecrow<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.979> like<00:01:09.190> basically<00:01:09.670> a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
scrap-iron scarecrow is like basically a

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.960 
scrap-iron scarecrow is like basically a
permit<00:01:10.780> necro<00:01:11.080> gardna<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.580> obviously

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
permit necro gardna but we obviously

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.710 
permit necro gardna but we obviously
don't<00:01:13.630> move<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.710> carpet<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.160> graveyard<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
don't move this carpet and graveyard to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.370 
don't move this carpet and graveyard to
negate<00:01:17.440> an<00:01:17.560> attack<00:01:18.570> sometimes<00:01:19.570> necro<00:01:20.020> gardens

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
negate an attack sometimes necro gardens

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.680 
negate an attack sometimes necro gardens
effect<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.890> actually<00:01:21.340> better<00:01:21.880> because<00:01:22.210> it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
effect is actually better because it's

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.010 
effect is actually better because it's
harder<00:01:23.259> to<00:01:23.790> hard<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.940> negate<00:01:25.270> neck<00:01:25.600> regards

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
harder to hard to negate neck regards

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.870 
harder to hard to negate neck regards
effect<00:01:26.320> than<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.649> is<00:01:26.800> this<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.430> takes<00:01:30.640> up

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
effect than it is this so this takes up

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.810 
effect than it is this so this takes up
some<00:01:31.060> space<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:31.570> here<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.140> this<00:01:32.710> trap<00:01:33.310> spell

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
some space on here on this trap spell

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.469 
some space on here on this trap spell
zone<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.460> really<00:01:36.759> helpful<00:01:37.060> against

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
zone but it is really helpful against

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.370 
zone but it is really helpful against
swarm<00:01:37.930> decks<00:01:38.259> like<00:01:38.590> lightsworn<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.399> zombies

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
swarm decks like lightsworn and zombies

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.900 
swarm decks like lightsworn and zombies
because<00:01:41.380> they<00:01:41.560> use<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.740> lot<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.009> monsters<00:01:42.610> and

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
because they use a lot of monsters and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.029 
because they use a lot of monsters and
you<00:01:43.149> can<00:01:43.270> always<00:01:43.539> reuse<00:01:43.720> these<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.560> take<00:01:44.830> your

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
you can always reuse these and take your

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.580 
you can always reuse these and take your
like<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.190> good<00:01:45.399> draw<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.000> card

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.639 

but<00:01:49.310> uh<00:01:49.420> there's<00:01:50.420> some<00:01:50.630> other<00:01:50.929> carbon<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.469> can

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
but uh there's some other carbon you can

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.580 
but uh there's some other carbon you can
use<00:01:51.799> shrink<00:01:52.719> now<00:01:53.719> shrink<00:01:54.250> it's<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:56.439> instant<00:01:57.439> by

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
use shrink now shrink it's a instant by
