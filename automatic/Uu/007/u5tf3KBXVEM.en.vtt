 I always buy so that at the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.410
 according to my pocket 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 sometimes when I see that the most 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 dear that I know is the most expensive ever 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.980
 the best 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.909
 better but we have to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 unfortunately can not afford not to 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:57.870
 Will not wait, I already know what the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.129
 products I use look out 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 outside of that everything is more expensive than I 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.350
 I use a lot but I do not give up because 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.299
 it's a good product 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.460
 thinking of agility and practicality 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.740
 unilever won in the country two lines of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.530
 computers and invest heavily in 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.369
 category we have planned this 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.350
 launch 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.080
 looking a lot at the economic reality 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.000
 of Brazilian women and the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.759
 fact that we have new legislation of the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.930
 this brings two factors 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.649
 that favor the development of this 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.229
 category 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.149
 the first best use of the hours is that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.500
 This domestic works at home. 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.880
 so the faster and with more 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.850
 that it is able to carry out the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.259
 home cleaning longest she has 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.820
 to dedicate to other tasks like 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.280
 take care of clothes take care 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.100
 in some cases the kids housekeeping and 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.229
 everything else and the second point is that this 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.420
 allows consumers who do not have 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.729
 or have a domestic less often than 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.679
 she would like to have at home to make 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.600
 daily cleaning or maintenance of your 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.460
 home with much less effort much more 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.800
 practicality a better result 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.679
 with an investment of 50 million reais 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.750
 the unit promotes this year the 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.429
 which come packaged differently for 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.569
 meet the demand of all classes 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.450
 social 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.519
 abec that are two lines that already make 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.620
 very successful outside Brazil in 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.409
 markets like europe china and turkey 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.409
 and is a product portfolio has been 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.239
 developed is globally but rather the 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.579
 people have adapted to bring more 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.170
 suitable for the Brazilian consumer 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.680
 either by format or by price range 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 or fragrance or even the segments that 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.980
 people are coming in 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.629
 apple, for example education on the river 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.700
 knowing that the Brazilian consumer is 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.099
 a demanding consumer and has the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.889
 see every real that it spends worth 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.139
 and there is a tale of education equation 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.030
 value that we adapt or serve 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.349
 to taste is not adapted to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.629
 Brazilian consumer since the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.329
 communication makes us super heavy is 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.430
 to educate consumers to evolve in the 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.829
 how to clean or know the cell phone 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.609

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.310
 clean 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.569
 the infected one free of germs but 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.989
 also in the way she buys 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.340
 category then we're trying to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.680
 how to impose such 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.900
 two brands to facilitate the mission of 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.729
 purchase it in the event of sale and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.849
 Buying cleaning products a habit 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:21.569
 more enjoyable and not a difficult task 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.569
