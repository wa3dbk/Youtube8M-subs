00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
hi okay back to this so grab this empty

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.379 
hi okay back to this so grab this empty
grab<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.980> bone<00:00:11.190> ctrl<00:00:11.610> P<00:00:11.849> bone<00:00:13.639> on<00:00:14.639> by<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> way

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
grab that bone ctrl P bone on by the way

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.890 
grab that bone ctrl P bone on by the way
this<00:00:15.900> would<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.820> all<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> second<00:00:20.390> part<00:00:21.390> 9<00:00:21.869> of

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
this would be all on a second part 9 of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.730 
this would be all on a second part 9 of
this<00:00:24.900> video<00:00:25.199> tutorial<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:28.170> suggest<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
this video tutorial and I suggest that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.359 
this video tutorial and I suggest that
you<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> first<00:00:30.689> 8<00:00:30.960> before<00:00:31.800> seeing<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you see the first 8 before seeing this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.470 
you see the first 8 before seeing this
one<00:00:32.640> because<00:00:33.450> you'll<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.780> lost<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:35.010> anyway<00:00:38.480> now

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
one because you'll be lost so anyway now

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
one because you'll be lost so anyway now
like<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.840> said<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.230> might<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> tweak<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
like I said you might have to tweak a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
like I said you might have to tweak a
little<00:00:41.399> bit<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.200> far<00:00:43.500> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
little bit I don't like how far this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.180 
little bit I don't like how far this
nose<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.340> being<00:00:44.579> stretched

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
nose is being stretched

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.209 
nose is being stretched
she<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:48.170> black<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:51.059> simply<00:00:51.920> fix<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
she looks black so I can simply fix that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.330 
she looks black so I can simply fix that
by<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.570> reducing<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.260> influence<00:00:55.649> because

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
by just reducing the influence because

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.139 
by just reducing the influence because
red<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.320> full<00:00:58.590> influence<00:00:59.219> green

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
red is one which is full influence green

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.620 
red is one which is full influence green
is<00:01:02.300> yellow<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:04.589> one-third<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.390> for

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is yellow is one-third in one for

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
is yellow is one-third in one for
three-fourths<00:01:07.439> influence<00:01:08.240> green<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
three-fourths influence green is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.460 
three-fourths influence green is
one-half<00:01:10.200> influence<00:01:10.830> blue<00:01:12.110> really<00:01:13.110> light

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
one-half influence blue really light

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.030 
one-half influence blue really light
blue<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.450> 1/4<00:01:15.450> influence<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> dark<00:01:16.560> blue<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
blue is 1/4 influence and dark blue is

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.120 
blue is 1/4 influence and dark blue is
zero<00:01:17.400> influence<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
zero influence so I'm going to do that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:33.080 
zero influence so I'm going to do that
okay<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.189> I've<00:01:23.400> taken<00:01:23.610> care<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.820 

it's<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.200> let's<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.440> back<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> business<00:01:39.830> well

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
it's not let's get back to business well

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.219 
it's not let's get back to business well
what<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.780> I'm<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:55.540 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.710> shape<00:01:44.040> key<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.630> character

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.350 

and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 

I'm<00:02:00.900> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.260> make<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.620> shake<00:02:01.890> key<00:02:02.190> based

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
I'm going to make the shake key based

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.280 
I'm going to make the shake key based
upon<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:04.500> deformation<00:02:05.190> of<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.490> lattice<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:07.020> I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
upon the deformation of the lattice so I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.310 
upon the deformation of the lattice so I
want<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.369> bone<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.030> copy<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.720> location<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
want this bone to copy the location of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.960 
want this bone to copy the location of
this<00:02:10.500> bone<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.750> gun<00:02:13.070> grab<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.250> bone<00:02:14.520> then

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
this bone so gun grab this bone then

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.380 
this bone so gun grab this bone then
that<00:02:15.210> bone<00:02:15.690> control<00:02:16.200> alt<00:02:16.530> C<00:02:16.860> copy<00:02:17.790> location

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that bone control alt C copy location

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.060 
that bone control alt C copy location
and<00:02:21.560> depress<00:02:22.560> local<00:02:23.430> space<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:24.420> both<00:02:25.380> sides

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and depress local space on both sides

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.910 
and depress local space on both sides
now<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.450> should<00:02:27.780> work<00:02:30.050> say<00:02:31.050> that's<00:02:31.350> how<00:02:31.560> far<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
now it should work say that's how far I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.090 
now it should work say that's how far I
want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.520> move<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:34.700> bone<00:02:36.290> for<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.320> shape<00:02:40.100> so

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
want to move the bone for the shape so

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.350 
want to move the bone for the shape so
now<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.520> go<00:02:41.670> ahead<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.030> make<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.390> shape

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
now I can go ahead and make the shape

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.479 
now I can go ahead and make the shape
this<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.570> another<00:02:45.900> case<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.590> where<00:02:46.920> it's<00:02:47.220> all

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
this is another case and where it's all

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.120 
this is another case and where it's all
it<00:02:47.820> depends<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.570> your<00:02:48.750> character<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.860> I'm

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
it depends on your character so I'm

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.240 
it depends on your character so I'm
going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.520> pause<00:02:51.090> again<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.140> you're<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.130> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
going to pause again and you're going to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.320 
going to pause again and you're going to
see<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.570> result<00:02:58.850> something<00:02:59.850> that's<00:03:00.120> really

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
see the result something that's really

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.199 
see the result something that's really
important<00:03:00.870> when<00:03:01.110> you're<00:03:01.230> making<00:03:01.260> shape<00:03:01.770> keys

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
important when you're making shape keys

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.479 
important when you're making shape keys
is<00:03:03.209> being<00:03:04.050> able<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.350> see<00:03:04.709> what<00:03:04.950> you're<00:03:05.070> doing

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
is being able to see what you're doing

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.460 
is being able to see what you're doing
in<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.970> edit<00:03:06.209> mode<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:09.049> bet<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.170> didn't<00:03:10.440> know

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
in the edit mode I bet you didn't know

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.699 
in the edit mode I bet you didn't know
this<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.870> see<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.260> armature

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
this but you can see the armature

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.479 
this but you can see the armature
deformation<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.470> lattice<00:03:16.830> deformation

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
deformation and the lattice deformation

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.920 
deformation and the lattice deformation
inside<00:03:18.060> edit<00:03:18.360> mode<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.209> see<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.810> can

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
inside edit mode so can you see you can

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.910 
inside edit mode so can you see you can
also<00:03:22.080> see<00:03:22.290> subsurf<00:03:22.980> edge<00:03:23.790> split<00:03:24.750> yeah<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.799> this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
also see subsurf edge split yeah so this

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.229 
also see subsurf edge split yeah so this
is<00:03:29.130> very<00:03:29.370> helpful<00:03:29.640> when<00:03:29.910> you're<00:03:30.060> making

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
is very helpful when you're making

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.160 
is very helpful when you're making
correct<00:03:30.690> correction<00:03:31.290> shape<00:03:31.530> keys

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
correct correction shape keys

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.800 
correct correction shape keys
alright<00:03:34.170> I've<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.530> modeled<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:35.100> first<00:03:35.370> shape

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
alright I've just modeled my first shape

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.479 
alright I've just modeled my first shape
it's<00:03:36.810> called<00:03:37.080> widen<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.160> what<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
it's called widen and this is what the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.920 
it's called widen and this is what the
shape<00:03:41.730> looks<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:44.269> now<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.660> what<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
shape looks like now this is what the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.020 
shape looks like now this is what the
shape<00:03:46.140> looks<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.709> with<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.100> modifiers<00:03:47.700> on

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
shape looks like with the modifiers on

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.160 
shape looks like with the modifiers on
now<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.080> turn<00:03:49.320> this<00:03:49.500> lattice<00:03:49.950> off<00:03:51.170> that's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
now if I turn this lattice off that's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.490 
now if I turn this lattice off that's
what<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.500> shape<00:03:52.739> really<00:03:52.980> looks<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:54.500> lattice

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
what the shape really looks like lattice

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:05.470 
what the shape really looks like lattice
off<00:03:55.739> lattice<00:03:56.519> on<00:03:56.760> lattice<00:03:57.600> off<00:03:57.870> lattice<00:03:58.680> on

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.759 

now<00:04:06.920> that's<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.310> wide<00:04:08.849> shape<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.930> don't

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
now that's just a wide shape and I don't

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.930 
now that's just a wide shape and I don't
even<00:04:10.980> know<00:04:11.160> if<00:04:11.280> I'm<00:04:11.430> gonna<00:04:11.580> go<00:04:11.849> with<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:13.940> but

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
even know if I'm gonna go with it but

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.580 
even know if I'm gonna go with it but
it'll<00:04:15.180> work<00:04:15.209> for<00:04:15.660> now<00:04:17.570> okay<00:04:21.229> so<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.260> have<00:04:22.560> my

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it'll work for now okay so I have my

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:33.230 
it'll work for now okay so I have my
shape<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:28.190> don't<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:30.440> have<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.919> have<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.060> make

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
shape and I don't I have I have to make

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.290 
shape and I don't I have I have to make
two<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.750> them<00:04:34.970> now

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
two of them now

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.020 
two of them now
I<00:04:37.700> don't<00:04:38.700> want<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.940> do<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.330> because<00:04:41.030> it's

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
I don't want to do that because it's

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.580 
I don't want to do that because it's
very<00:04:42.300> hard<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.960> get<00:04:43.080> symmetry<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.840> would<00:04:46.050> be

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
very hard to get symmetry it would be

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.610 
very hard to get symmetry it would be
nice<00:04:46.860> if<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:48.210> could<00:04:49.790> split<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.150> shaky<00:04:51.750> oh<00:04:51.990> wait

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
nice if I could split the shaky oh wait

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:00.080 
nice if I could split the shaky oh wait
I<00:04:52.860> can<00:04:53.900> how<00:04:58.160> let's<00:04:59.160> take<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.400> look<00:04:59.669> at<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.850> shape

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
I can how let's take a look at the shape

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.469 
I can how let's take a look at the shape
key<00:05:00.830> area<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:03.150> have<00:05:03.330> edge<00:05:03.630> shape<00:05:03.990> relative<00:05:04.500> a

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
key area you have edge shape relative a

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.350 
key area you have edge shape relative a
bunch<00:05:06.479> of<00:05:06.630> this<00:05:06.720> stuff<00:05:06.780> an<00:05:07.550> influence<00:05:08.550> V<00:05:09.090> group

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
bunch of this stuff an influence V group

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.480 
bunch of this stuff an influence V group
V<00:05:10.050> group<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.970> stands<00:05:12.270> for<00:05:12.360> vertex<00:05:12.810> group<00:05:14.120> so

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
V group that stands for vertex group so

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.570 
V group that stands for vertex group so
here's<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.580> theory<00:05:18.000> if<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:19.020> create<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.650> vertex

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
here's a theory if I create a vertex

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.730 
here's a theory if I create a vertex
group<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:26.729> consists<00:05:27.389> of<00:05:27.510> half<00:05:28.440> of<00:05:28.650> these

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
group that consists of half of these

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:40.279 
group that consists of half of these
faces

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.859 

and<00:05:40.379> then<00:05:41.159> so<00:05:42.059> I'm<00:05:42.210> going<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.449> create<00:05:42.629> a<00:05:42.719> new

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:42.869 
and then so I'm going to create a new

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:44.889 
and then so I'm going to create a new
vertex<00:05:43.229> group<00:05:43.499> new<00:05:43.800> I'm<00:05:44.069> going<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.309> call<00:05:44.460> this

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:44.899 
vertex group new I'm going to call this

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:59.719 
vertex group new I'm going to call this
Seidel<00:05:51.110> influence<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.229> one<00:05:52.409> assign<00:05:58.520> I'm<00:05:59.520> going

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
Seidel influence of one assign I'm going

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:11.559 
Seidel influence of one assign I'm going
to<00:05:59.789> grab<00:05:59.999> the<00:06:00.599> other<00:06:00.779> half<00:06:00.899> the<00:06:01.619> other<00:06:01.770> side

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:18.480 

this<00:06:12.169> is<00:06:12.319> going<00:06:12.529> to<00:06:12.649> be<00:06:12.770> new<00:06:14.050> side<00:06:15.279> dots<00:06:16.279> are<00:06:16.639> a

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
this is going to be new side dots are a

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.779 
this is going to be new side dots are a
sign<00:06:19.490> and<00:06:20.409> hit<00:06:21.409> select<00:06:21.860> to<00:06:22.039> make<00:06:22.069> sure<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.639> it

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
sign and hit select to make sure that it

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:31.989 
sign and hit select to make sure that it
worked<00:06:26.679> it<00:06:27.679> worked<00:06:27.919> so<00:06:30.369> now<00:06:31.369> let's<00:06:31.729> take<00:06:31.939> a

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:31.999 
worked it worked so now let's take a

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:44.120 
worked it worked so now let's take a
look<00:06:32.300> at<00:06:32.449> it<00:06:32.599> in<00:06:32.749> the<00:06:32.869> weight<00:06:33.050> paint<00:06:33.319> mode

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.510 

okay<00:06:45.090> I'm<00:06:45.210> gonna<00:06:45.390> have<00:06:45.690> gonna<00:06:46.320> blur<00:06:46.740> some

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
okay I'm gonna have gonna blur some

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.510 
okay I'm gonna have gonna blur some
vertices<00:06:48.000> in<00:06:48.450> the<00:06:49.050> middle<00:06:49.320> to<00:06:50.130> make<00:06:50.310> this<00:06:50.460> a
