a<00:02:43.989> pencil<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:45.189> save<00:02:45.400> battery<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.329> if<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.599> ask

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
a pencil to save battery but if you ask

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.720 
a pencil to save battery but if you ask
me<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.109> uses<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> lot<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> battery<00:02:47.980> because<00:02:48.459> if

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
me this uses a lot of battery because if

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.179 
me this uses a lot of battery because if
you<00:02:48.970> die<00:02:49.269> pretty<00:02:50.109> much<00:02:50.260> freezes<00:02:50.799> on<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> last

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
thing you see so I would imagine that we

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.890 
thing you see so I would imagine that we
use<00:02:53.170> less<00:02:53.409> than<00:02:53.650> all<00:02:53.799> this<00:02:53.980> stuff<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:54.900> there

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
use less than all this stuff but there

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720
