 1983 at krone apprenticeship came to a 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.350
 training and since then I am 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.350
 the company remained faithful 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.040
 new is the agricultural engineering sales of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.250
 service and now the biggest one 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.370
 Agricultural traders in the region 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.600
 We are a service partner of the company John 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.570
 Deere rhyme also other products and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.059
 predominantly looks after the crown products 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.220
 and my job is the one 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.210
 repair and maintenance 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.600
 the machine is the sparrow situation 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.830
 always so the first sentences only beginnings 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.850
 in matters 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.610
 start or a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.340
 other crown products to the people 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.820
 to explain how to deal with the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.820
 bypass the machine 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.220
 my highlight here was mine 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.390
 foreign assignment in chile 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.250
 and there we have 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.650
 the custom machine sells and the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.409
 I decided then leyen the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.110
 explained and have the used 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.350
 machine over several days so that the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.680
 Chileans also deal with the machine 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.009
 could the lovely word be that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.409
 challenge the challenge when 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.680
 the customer is calling 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.170
 he has a defect and we have to get one 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.350
 drive and we know exactly who has 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.289
 customer who correctly formulates what is coming 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.209
 every now and then it is the mechanics it is the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.100
 electrics that's always the case 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.520
 Challenge you have to do in the morning 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.290
 when you get the job 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.660
 what did the machine really get like? 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.590
 I'm the fastest mobile again 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.940
 that the customer can continue working with 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.140
 with the customer service I am 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.459
 almost daily on the way in the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.980
 Winter months is a bit quieter 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.640
 was therefore not so much on the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.970
 But arable is made from march on 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.260
 march to november december if we 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.920
 through finally on our way 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.920
 to serve customers 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.680
 many after the start of work obermeister 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.540
 berger divides the people and I should 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.019
 now drive to a customer the one 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.770
 new start for 20 has got latest 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.720
 generation where we are 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.420
 Carry out 100-hour inspections 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.420
 should and he still has a guarantee 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.010
 work without a complaint since one 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.840
 speed encoder does not work properly 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.680
 should 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.280
 Let's do it now 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.860
 see if the sensor of the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.180
 switching distance is okay or just 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.900
 the sensor is defective 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.720
 but we can see that the job is on the spot 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.060
 very interesting and it is every day 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.540
 That's why I like a challenge 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.540
 the job like this
