00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
you but I just like to start from the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.500 
you but I just like to start from the
bottom<00:04:05.470> up<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:08.170> has<00:04:08.650> silica<00:04:09.549> in<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:10.030> so

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
bottom up so this has silica in it so

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.210 
bottom up so this has silica in it so
it's<00:04:10.780> naturally<00:04:11.470> going<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.769> mattify<00:04:11.980> your

it's naturally going to mattify your
legs<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.709> um<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.769> think<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.310> was<00:04:15.370> first

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700
