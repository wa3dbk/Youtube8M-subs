00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and then a couple of seconds he's gonna

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.010 
and then a couple of seconds he's gonna
come<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.119> again<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.630> dodge<00:01:12.869> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
come back again I'm gonna dodge this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620 
come back again I'm gonna dodge this
again<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.979> outcome<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.420> we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
again the outcome is going to be that we

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
again the outcome is going to be that we
kill<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> Tryndamere<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.180> eventually<00:01:18.180> we

possible<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.090> indulge<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.290> thing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
possible to indulge this thing

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.609 
possible to indulge this thing
consistently<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.270> key<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:25.110> doing<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
consistently and the key to doing this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
consistently and the key to doing this
is<00:01:25.890> putting<00:01:26.369> yourself<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.210> his<00:01:27.540> position<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
is putting yourself in his position and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.120 
is putting yourself in his position and
thinking<00:01:29.150> at<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.659> moment<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.680> are

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
thinking at the very moment you are

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
thinking at the very moment you are
about<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.729> away<00:01:33.000> from<00:01:33.570> him<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:34.020> needs<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
about to get away from him he needs to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
about to get away from him he needs to
slow<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.369> close<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> gap<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.600> use

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
slow you right or close the gap or use

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
slow you right or close the gap or use
some<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.500> skill<00:01:38.130> ability<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.729> maybe

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
some kind of skill ability or maybe

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.670 
some kind of skill ability or maybe
flush<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.450> top<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:40.020> something<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.619> stop

then you are dodging it the same applies

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
then you are dodging it the same applies
to<00:01:50.070> many<00:01:50.909> different<00:01:51.329> things<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.869> for

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to many different things like for

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.190 
to many different things like for
example<00:01:52.280> targeted<00:01:53.280> stance<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:54.000> skill<00:01:54.899> shots

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
example targeted stance or skill shots

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.950 
example targeted stance or skill shots
that<00:01:55.470> are<00:01:56.310> much<00:01:56.820> easier<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.210> dodge<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.810> you're

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that are much easier to dodge if you're

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.440 
that are much easier to dodge if you're
predicting<00:01:58.950> even<00:01:59.640> though<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> seems<00:02:00.240> like

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
predicting even though it seems like

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
predicting even though it seems like
it's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.750> reaction<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.920> example<00:02:01.979> someone

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
it's a reaction when for example someone

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.749 
it's a reaction when for example someone
flushes<00:02:02.880> sonic<00:02:03.600> crescendo<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
flushes sonic crescendo it's more of a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.999 
flushes sonic crescendo it's more of a
prediction<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.659> assume<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.439> someone

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
prediction and you assume that someone

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.119 
prediction and you assume that someone
has<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.090> certain<00:02:09.989> thing<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.950> get

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
has to do a certain thing or you get

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.260 
has to do a certain thing or you get
away<00:02:11.370> or

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
away or

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.390 
away or
kill<00:02:12.480> them<00:02:12.690> or<00:02:13.110> something<00:02:13.320> that's<00:02:14.160> how<00:02:14.370> you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
kill them or something that's how you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 
kill them or something that's how you
know<00:02:14.730> when<00:02:15.300> they<00:02:15.540> use<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.960> skill<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.410> a

critical moment when you're about to get

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
that skill is and how to dodge this is

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.810 
that skill is and how to dodge this is
going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> come<00:02:28.740> from<00:02:28.770> your<00:02:29.250> game<00:02:29.550> knowledge

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
going to come from your game knowledge

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820 
going to come from your game knowledge
so<00:02:30.300> keep<00:02:30.330> learning<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> champions

think<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.620> ways<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.220> predict<00:02:35.820> enemy

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
think of the ways you can predict enemy

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.410 
think of the ways you can predict enemy
movement<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.080> dodge<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.400> skill<00:02:38.730> before<00:02:38.970> it

movement and dodge the skill before it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.360 
movement and dodge the skill before it
is<00:02:39.570> even<00:02:39.600> launched<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:40.980> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> help
