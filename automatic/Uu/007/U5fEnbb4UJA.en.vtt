00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.780 
you know I felt real comfortable and I

think that I'll probably take it

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.400 
think that I'll probably take it
hopefully<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.360> didn't<00:02:51.019> come<00:02:51.110> here<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.290> get

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
hopefully I didn't come here to get

hopefully I didn't come here to get
second<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:53.150> mark<00:02:53.360> dumb<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.900> fine<00:02:54.230> though

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410

they<00:02:54.590> look<00:02:55.040> great<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.760> think<00:02:55.790> those<00:02:56.269> are

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
they look great and I think those are

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300 
they look great and I think those are
the<00:02:56.690> biggest<00:02:56.900> competition<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.069> at<00:02:58.160> this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
show overall the way I go about is that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.589 
show overall the way I go about is that
I<00:03:00.500> can't<00:03:00.830> really<00:03:01.010> control<00:03:01.310> what<00:03:01.730> they're

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
I can't really control what they're

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.330 
I can't really control what they're
doing<00:03:02.989> if<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.349> come<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.650> where<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.010> want<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> be
