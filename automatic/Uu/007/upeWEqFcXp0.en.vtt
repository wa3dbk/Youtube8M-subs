00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.599
 also listen today I 'm doing you 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000
 a very quick video announcement 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.260
 very short very precise finally we're going 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.399
 try so the last video I you 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.270
 I had claude finally in the penultimate 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.290
 since the last one was a little 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.940
 mounting the girl 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.950
 but just before I offered you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 a little video where I will 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780
 offer batum and clips you can 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.040
 download on mediafire so this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.600
 either clips of cinematics finally 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.420
 Here there are about 5 type gigas 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.220
 download in four what to do and in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 followed up on that and I received a lot 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.460
 messages from people who have 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.260
 so interested in my clips that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 wanted to do 1-1 and said finally on 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.150
 to test stuff on it and that's it 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 received messages from people who 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.960
 wanted to send me the message 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 fall but the message during editing 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.670
 so that I can give my opinion or 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.180
 that this is it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 legal brothels these brothels to sum up 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.509
 so I'm completely on the hook 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 here I was really not expecting 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.840
 so many quayside stakes which 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 is as many people who download 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.979
 my clips but if it works well that you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.180
 liked you many to want you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.940
 to launch in editing so frankly 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.630
 it's really fun and so following 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.009
 a suggestion from a very dear machado 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.050
 on facebook and who is so who has me 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.640
 asked what told me yes it would not be 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.830
 badly that you organize some kind of top 5 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 or a top 10 zenith made at 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.530
 from clip bays 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.940
 and ben it's true it's not a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.440
 bad idea especially as it is 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.640
 as I told him where I think you 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.410
 will be many to make small 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.190
 things on my clips and so suddenly 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.360
 that's just a little fun 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.069
 to share a little bit my channel on 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.509
 will say that like that 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.310
 well here I am going to organize at table 5 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.030
 is said or a top 10 it will depend on the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.009
 number of people who participate so 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.160
 d edith made from my clips 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.050
 so that's it and so if that's it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.790
 Please I think in the future I 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.290
 will not do well then it will not be all 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.050
 weeks but from time to time 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.240
 small of the top 5 or the top 10 is said 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.770
 but against there from others who 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.720
 what disassembly as you want with 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.720
 clips of anyone finally that's it 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.930
 after i'm thinking of doing some stuff a little 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.280
 little more than the borie story of you 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.770
 share a little more my channel 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.340
 and that's the passion of the East says it all 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.630
 it 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.940
 so we're not there yet so for 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.180
 the moment here it's going to be a top 5 so 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.640
 say on my clips a game 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.019
 I make it clear because otherwise it's seen 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.920
 we started shooting after that 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.329
 to be big brothel so we will enunciate 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.159
 some small rules meringue well 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.629
 naughty so basically what I'm you 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.269
 request this is at least one is said to 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.370
 minimum 45 seconds you use at 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.719
 minus three different clips so that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.700
 can be a single clip with two 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.319
 cutscenes that go with this game 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.670
 I envy you ask not much more 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.849
 it's better I want you 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.459
 to say I'm rather greedy so more 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.049
 here is better here to use a 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.689
 music not copyright obviously because 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.040
 that if not if you said I like you 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.870
 and which is part of the top 5 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.849
 if there is a copyright music I do not 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.099
 may unfortunately not broadcast it on my 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.389
 chain obviously told you I'm going 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.290
 pass them on my channel maybe not 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.879
 in full I do not know yet how 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.040
 I 'm going to clean up with all this 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.240
 but this fund must be avoided as much as possible 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.510
 music copyright 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.070
 this is in fact one year deadline jamie 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.690
 because I made an announcement first 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.370
 on facebook and so I gave like 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.010
 date December 1st 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.520
 so that did not seem to shock 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.800
 big world 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.300
 so if you ever think it's 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.670
 too few do not hesitate to tell me 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.440
 and the same if for example you see that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.120
 I know that I November 29 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.350
 you will not be ready in time you 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.670
 see me a little message telling me 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.490
 here I am three days late 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.590
 there is no problem at home 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.110
 I also take us latecomers 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.520
 here you go 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.010
 December 1 to offer me a small 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.890
 a small montage without no so you 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.930
 do exactly what you want a 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.150
 do not feel particularly obliged to 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.270
 do something to do like me 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.620
 I do not like saying that because it 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.140
 does the guy you have is good I'm not the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.670
 guy a cat but as normal what but 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.500
 here you edit frankly as you 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.060
 want with your style it can be 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.830
 the arcor it can be dubstep it can 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.330
 to be electro it can be epic 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.420
 it can be anything 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.770
 I will not judge the style by 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.020
 report to mine here it is really 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.090
 I will judge the lady time as it is 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.590
 if they please me if he touches me so here 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.210
 you see a little bit the idea so 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.110
 frankly you do what you do 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.370
 want if you want to put some 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.180
 replicas put replicas if you 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.710
 want by m 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.420
 no but you're not there is no problem 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.450
 on it the only thing that I you 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.950
 request is to avoid as much as possible 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.450
 dutil if possible for example you 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.500
 want to put replicas to use 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.480
 replicas that I have already used 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.910
 in a montage for example you can 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.960
 in me it's not I have not I'm not shouting 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.810
 to plagiarism at the age machine but that's 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.730
 just for me since in a lot who 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.230
 ask me to judge their assembly and 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.280
 they use music I used 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.440
 with the same replicas and that's right 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.970
 that for me it's pretty delicate of 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.710
 judge montages like that because 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.090
 necessarily I compare to I compare to 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.860
 mine so you see it's really not 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.940
 obvious so here is basically 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.560
 you do what you want you 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.870
 do really say that you 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.750
 want and see you on December 1st 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.340
 well that we will close his and then some 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.990
 maybe a fortnight later I get you 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.470
 will do a video where I will introduce you 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.560
 so the said them that kim in my opinion 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.580
 so they will please me the most so 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.440
 so that's good I'm doing it's a little 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.610
 little to rage so guys like I 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.260
 said on facebook I'm sorry but 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.190
 I have no gift to offer 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.650
 really not a thing 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.750
 here I have no tuner guys I you the 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.050
 say I have no money 1 we do with this 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.060
 that we have 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.200
 here we do it to have fun if I 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.250
 can you do a little pub I will you 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.600
 will do with great pleasure 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.100
 but those voices I'm really that 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.190
 to share a little more 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.450
 with you that passion she 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.370
 editing and then for once 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.190
 it's you who will work and it's me 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.080
 who goes that is a cold here a little 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.080
 the idea so listen do you pleasure 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.960
 Here I think I've said all along 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.919
 to send me your editing here 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.449
 I was going to forget because now we 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.310
 can no longer send the videos you know 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.280
 in video commentary so you send me 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.860
 a private message on on youtube with 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.620
 as the title of the message top 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.849
 edit lmrp it's just the story that me 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.379
 I find myself in my messages that I 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.610
 Am I sure not to go to 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.379
 side of a montage because it would make me 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.909
 shit anyway and see since here 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.280
 how we have a lot of messages it's 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.780
 not always obvious so here so if 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.860
 all messages with montages have 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.400
 same title it will be much easier 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.460
 for me 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.960
 and here I think I have said everything so 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.349
 you have questions do not hesitate to 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.849
 ask them 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.400
 I think you noticed that I 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.440
 respond frequently or to comments 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.200
 by the comments space is a little there 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.240
 for that 1
