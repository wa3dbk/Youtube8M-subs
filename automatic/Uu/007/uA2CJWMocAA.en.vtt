00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
about my business or this morning I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.800 
about my business or this morning I
looked<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.519> it<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.850> was<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> little<00:02:29.239> frizzy<00:02:29.480> from

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
looked at it it was a little frizzy from

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.670 
looked at it it was a little frizzy from
the<00:02:29.989> UM<00:02:31.360> from<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.540> water<00:02:32.750> obviously<00:02:32.989> nothing

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
the UM from the water obviously nothing

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.440 
the UM from the water obviously nothing
too<00:02:33.860> major<00:02:34.100> but<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.610> was<00:02:34.730> joyous<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.390> I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
too major but it was joyous I think I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.699 
too major but it was joyous I think I
would<00:02:35.600> take<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.780> out<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.700> result

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
would take it out and this is the result

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.930 
would take it out and this is the result
which<00:02:39.709> I'm<00:02:39.860> actually<00:02:40.040> absolutely<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:40.910> love

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
which I'm actually absolutely in love

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.819 
which I'm actually absolutely in love
with<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.329> didn't<00:02:41.690> have<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> ends<00:02:42.230> curled<00:02:42.590> and

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
with I didn't have the ends curled and

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.949 
with I didn't have the ends curled and
I've<00:02:43.370> never<00:02:43.549> actually<00:02:43.730> taken<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.239> kinky<00:02:44.720> twist

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
I've never actually taken a kinky twist

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.990 
I've never actually taken a kinky twist
out<00:02:45.200> before<00:02:45.829> with<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.100> ends<00:02:46.340> girl<00:02:46.549> who<00:02:46.760> gave

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
out before with the ends girl who gave

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.509 
out before with the ends girl who gave
me<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.360> much<00:02:47.570> more<00:02:47.840> volume<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.070> my<00:02:49.190> hair<00:02:49.370> looks

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
me so much more volume so my hair looks

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.000 
me so much more volume so my hair looks
a<00:02:49.579> lot<00:02:49.730> thicker<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.470> normally<00:02:51.799> doesn't

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
a lot thicker then it normally doesn't

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.370 
a lot thicker then it normally doesn't
do<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.489> regular<00:02:52.730> serious<00:02:53.600> about<00:02:53.840> growing<00:02:53.989> in

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
do the regular serious about growing in

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.199 
do the regular serious about growing in
so<00:02:54.769> this<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.370> probably<00:02:55.549> something<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.970> wanted

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
so this is probably something I wanted

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.780 
so this is probably something I wanted
to<00:02:56.269> do<00:02:56.450> more<00:02:56.630> often<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.799> it's<00:02:58.250> going<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.519> come

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
to do more often so it's going to come

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.479
