00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.950
 disgusting May 31 in 2013 has a bowling that 7 3 7 and 800 in the approach 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.520
 in addition, one of pain twelve uses very short m of schaik path of it 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.330
 instrument landing system 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.789
 on the net only called lesson intercepted 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.669
 this led to a sudden-looking beach and subsequent activation 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.269
 of the stick for sure 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.850
 a warning that the aircraft is approaching the minimum flight speed 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.880
 and without immediate intervention 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.890
 threatens to fall from the sky 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.730
 after the stick sure activation the kites have lowered the nose 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.220
 speed up and a restart made 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 after this they landed without problems 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.630
 as a result of this incident, the safety investigation council is one 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.910
 investigation started 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.030
 and discovered that this incident is not unique 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.780
 at least four similar incidents have occurred in the past 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.110
 time occurred at different airports with different ones 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.570
 aircraft type 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.509
 That is why the safety warning has been issued worldwide 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.500
 the flight to eindhoven comes from the south and flies as standard 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.480
 approach route and direction lane 2 ing 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.130
 the air traffic controllers were instructed to change the course to 310 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.030
 holes 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.420
 to shorten the route somewhat 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.810
 however, this also means that the flight speed and the descent speed must be 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 are being adjusted 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.910
 the pilots use the brake valves for this 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.159
 the aircraft is flying in the clouds 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.460
 and both the autopilot and the automatic throttle system 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.550
 activated 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.250
 Traffic control is unaware of a strong top wins from poets 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.750
 bottlenecks from the north east and in the plane closer to the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.540
 runway 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.910
 the next worn course change of 250 degrees 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.130
 to intercept the ai and her lookalikes 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.089
 for a short time the final approach even further 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.379
 the strong start really wins before the runway also prevents it 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.029
 plane drops fast enough to be able to intercept the glide path 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.010
 the crew tries to compensate for this through the flats and the landing gear 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.009
 rather than usual from the blows 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.819
 approached from above by all factors for time glide path where approach 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.929
 from under a standard procedure 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.230
 the plane does not descend sufficiently 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.230
 and flies 1000 feet and above it 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.910
 the arjen lessons antennas use two gario signals 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:54.359
 a few hundred 50 hertz fly up signal and the ninety hits fly 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.809
 down signal 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:00.899
 if these signals are equally strong, the aircraft is on the right glide path to 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.429
 the runway 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:06.279
 usually the slide path of the sewing lesson has an angle of 3 degrees 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:11.519
 The investigation by the Investigation Board has shown that the Angeles antenna 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.099
 has a false reverse glide path signal at 9 degrees 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.430
 This reversal signals is potentially dangerous 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.650
 for planes that try to free up 3 degrees from above 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.569
 they intercept flies in an area 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.579
 true for a long time and clearly 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.830
 fly down signals received 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.269
 That's right sling turns into a fly up signal 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.899
 the autopilot is programmed to follow this signal 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.809
 this allows the nose position of the aircraft to increase rapidly 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:49.499
 but due to that flight speed it takes too much and the plane can already depart 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.480
 these properties of vance glide path signals 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.730
 with signal reversal occurring 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.640
 unknown in the aviation world and is incorrectly described in the aircraft 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.729
 manuals 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.729
 the unexpected behavior of the autopilot 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.160
 a potential hazard 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.109
 especially during landing skates 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.359
 it leaves the pilots little time to turn off the auto pilot gas 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.239
 to give and 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.239
 and restore 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.180
 test flights were conducted during the investigation to signal the glide path 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.270
 measure 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.699
 it turned out that the circumstances that led to the incident could be 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.650
 reproduced 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.850
 furthermore the measurement data from three different angeles anp dennis showed 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.319
 I don't think that can signal a child 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.030
 always takes place at 9 degrees 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.520
 m sometimes at 6 degrees 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.020
 the arjen les signals and at airports are regularly inspected and 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.789
 certified 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.590
 the upper limit of these inspections 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.720
 however, has an angle of 25 degrees to be added 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.669
 this means that the fake detected by the research council 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.720
 slide 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.720
 outside this inspection area of 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.900
 the research council recommends 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.720
 Avoid an aircraft in the area of ​​reverse ajazz signals 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.710
 can come 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.880
 In the unlikely event that this happens, ensure that the operational or 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.480
 technical measures are taken to prevent the aircraft from entering 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.870
 unexpectedly high nose position
