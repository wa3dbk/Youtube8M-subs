Adi<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.440> IDE<00:00:04.950> mode<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.940> dual<00:00:06.089> booting<00:00:06.359> Windows

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
Adi to IDE mode for dual booting Windows

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.020 
Adi to IDE mode for dual booting Windows
XP<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.410> Windows<00:00:07.470> 8<00:00:08.250> or<00:00:08.280> Windows<00:00:08.490> XP<00:00:08.970> and

XP and Windows 8 or Windows XP and
Windows<00:00:09.150> 7<00:00:09.510> now<00:00:10.139> I'm<00:00:10.200> going<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> show<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.530> how

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Windows 7 now I'm going to show you how

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.799 
Windows 7 now I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> VirtualBox<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> real

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to do this on a VirtualBox and on a real

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.169 
to do this on a VirtualBox and on a real
BIOS<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:13.950> need<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
BIOS so we need to do for this is the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
BIOS so we need to do for this is the
VirtualBox<00:00:15.540> part<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.619> select<00:00:17.369> your<00:00:17.430> virtual

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
VirtualBox part so select your virtual

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.509 
VirtualBox part so select your virtual
machine<00:00:18.680> click<00:00:19.680> settings<00:00:21.650> go<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.680> storage<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
machine click settings go to storage and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
machine click settings go to storage and
now<00:00:23.789> what<00:00:23.970> you'll<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.930> have

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
now what you'll see is that you have

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.980 
now what you'll see is that you have
under<00:00:25.350> SATA<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.039> virtual<00:00:26.160> hard<00:00:26.519> drive

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
under SATA is your virtual hard drive

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.560 
under SATA is your virtual hard drive
it's<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.320> HCI<00:00:29.070> mode<00:00:29.670> which<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.539> is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it's in HCI mode which what which is

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.550 
it's in HCI mode which what which is
what<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.960> don't<00:00:31.080> want

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
what we don't want

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.639 
what we don't want
HCI<00:00:32.399> mode<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> probably<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> best<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.200> your

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
HCI mode is probably the best for your

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
HCI mode is probably the best for your
hard<00:00:34.860> drive<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.880> you'd<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.329> IDE<00:00:36.809> mode

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
hard drive for but you'd need IDE mode

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.290 
hard drive for but you'd need IDE mode
for<00:00:37.469> dual<00:00:37.649> booting<00:00:37.860> Windows<00:00:38.160> XP<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:39.120> why

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
for dual booting Windows XP that's why

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
for dual booting Windows XP that's why
it's<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.750> good<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.290> IDE<00:00:40.770> mode<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it's not very good because IDE mode is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's not very good because IDE mode is
kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> slow<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.350> what

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
kind of slow just so you know so what

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
kind of slow just so you know so what
you<00:00:43.649> need<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.090> highlight

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you need to do is that just highlight

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.670 
you need to do is that just highlight
your<00:00:45.989> SATA<00:00:46.590> controller<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:48.559> click<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680

Remove controller button and then select

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.760 
Remove controller button and then select
the<00:00:53.579> IDE<00:00:54.329> controller<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:56.059> just<00:00:57.059> down<00:00:57.360> here

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
SATA mode setting all right here you can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.410 
SATA mode setting all right here you can
see<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.770> found<00:01:43.100> my<00:01:43.250> SATA<00:01:43.490> mode<00:01:43.580> setting<00:01:44.000> if

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
see that I found my SATA mode setting if

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.600 
see that I found my SATA mode setting if
your<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:45.680> already<00:01:45.979> an<00:01:46.040> IDE<00:01:46.340> mode

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
your I do it's already an IDE mode

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.520 
your I do it's already an IDE mode
because<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:46.940> do<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.570> was<00:01:47.870> like<00:01:47.990> speed

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
because I do but it was like speed

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.600 
because I do but it was like speed
before<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.100> had<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:49.460> it<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:51.400> that's<00:01:52.400> how

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
before and I had to do it so that's how

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.400 
before and I had to do it so that's how
you<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.000> just<00:01:53.150> switch<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.570> tiny<00:01:53.990> mode<00:01:54.260> if

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
you you just switch that tiny mode if

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.570 
you you just switch that tiny mode if
you're<00:01:54.560> having<00:01:54.770> any<00:01:54.860> problems<00:01:54.950> with<00:01:55.250> Windows

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
you're having any problems with Windows

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.820 
you're having any problems with Windows
XP<00:01:55.970> now<00:01:56.660> I'm<00:01:56.930> doing<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> laptop

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
XP now I'm doing this on a laptop

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.680 
XP now I'm doing this on a laptop
actually<00:01:58.490> because<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:58.790> cannot<00:01:59.150> find<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
actually because we cannot find the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.020 
actually because we cannot find the
setting<00:02:00.050> on<00:02:00.170> my<00:02:00.350> personal<00:02:00.890> desktop<00:02:01.369> now

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
setting on my personal desktop now

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.820 
setting on my personal desktop now
that's<00:02:02.240> because<00:02:02.479> my<00:02:02.960> hard<00:02:03.290> drive<00:02:03.530> probably

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
that's because my hard drive probably

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.889 
that's because my hard drive probably
just<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.070> supported<00:02:04.640> because<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.479> old

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
just is supported because it's so old

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.840 
just is supported because it's so old
that<00:02:06.410> setting<00:02:06.920> because<00:02:07.070> IDs<00:02:07.460> very<00:02:08.179> legacy

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
that setting because IDs very legacy

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.479 
that setting because IDs very legacy
connection<00:02:10.850> type<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.720> or<00:02:12.140> my<00:02:12.620> CPU<00:02:13.130> doesn't

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
connection type so or my CPU doesn't

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.310 
connection type so or my CPU doesn't
support<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.910> my<00:02:14.120> CPU<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.450> kind<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.750> old<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.290> that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
support it my CPU is kind of old so that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.190 
support it my CPU is kind of old so that
might<00:02:15.560> be<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.830> problem<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.820> um<00:02:17.180> anyway<00:02:18.110> if

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
might be the problem but um anyway if

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750 
might be the problem but um anyway if
you<00:02:18.320> don't<00:02:18.440> want<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.620> problem<00:02:18.890> your<00:02:19.370> hard

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
you don't want the problem your hard

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.250 
you don't want the problem your hard
drive<00:02:19.910> might<00:02:20.090> dynamically<00:02:20.720> switch<00:02:20.900> between

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
drive might dynamically switch between

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.310 
drive might dynamically switch between
the<00:02:21.590> two<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.070> install<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:23.420> yeah

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
the two so you can install it but yeah

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.170 
the two so you can install it but yeah
so<00:02:24.680> if<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:24.890> don't<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:25.970> either

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
so if you don't have it it's either

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.390 
so if you don't have it it's either
tough<00:02:26.540> luck<00:02:26.870> or<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.500> might<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.160> already

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
tough luck or you might have it already
