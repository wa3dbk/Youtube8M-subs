hi guys it's Audrey see the Sophie with

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.810 
hi guys it's Audrey see the Sophie with
the<00:00:08.749> science<00:00:09.110> of<00:00:09.230> black<00:00:09.440> hair<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:09.980> I'm<00:00:10.369> coming

like<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.320> important<00:02:04.830> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like these it's really important that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.130 
like these it's really important that
you<00:02:05.130> measure<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.640> pH<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.360> water<00:02:06.690> because

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you measure the pH of your water because

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
you measure the pH of your water because
it's<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.680> most<00:02:07.860> common<00:02:08.399> thing<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.610> come<00:02:09.000> in

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it's the most common thing to come in

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.570
