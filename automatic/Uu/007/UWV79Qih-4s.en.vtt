00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.820 
consider the fact that it's fully sealed
it<00:02:27.180> does<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.570> little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.110> an<00:02:28.260> impact

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it does have a little bit of an impact

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.010 
it does have a little bit of an impact
on<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> sound<00:02:29.250> quality<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.630> start<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
on the sound quality if we start up the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:47.070 
on the sound quality if we start up the
music<00:02:31.470> play

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.540 

we<00:02:48.080> actually<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.830> sound<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.370> is

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
we actually think the sound of that is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.680 
we actually think the sound of that is
pretty<00:02:50.360> good<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.910> could<00:02:53.060> take<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.510> with

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
pretty good you could take it out with

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.350 
pretty good you could take it out with
you<00:02:53.810> while<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.140> were<00:02:54.320> training<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:56.270> of

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
not quite as good as you might expect

not quite as good as you might expect
one<00:03:17.930> thing<00:03:17.960> we'll<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.410> look<00:03:18.560> at<00:03:18.680> now<00:03:18.710> is

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
one thing we'll have a look at now is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.340 
one thing we'll have a look at now is
the<00:03:19.160> web<00:03:19.490> browser<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:20.170> immediately<00:03:21.170> obvious

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
the web browser and immediately obvious

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.610 
the web browser and immediately obvious
in<00:03:21.710> Whitby<00:03:21.860> 2100<00:03:22.820> is<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.960> gsm-only

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
in Whitby 2100 is that it's a gsm-only

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.910 
in Whitby 2100 is that it's a gsm-only
twice<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.360> doesn't<00:03:26.780> have<00:03:26.870> 3G<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.500> we're

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
twice so it doesn't have 3G and we're

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.420 
twice so it doesn't have 3G and we're
browsing<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> little<00:03:28.580> bit<00:03:28.730> slow<00:03:30.430> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
browsing it's a little bit slow the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.410 
browsing it's a little bit slow the
first<00:03:31.640> thing<00:03:31.790> we're<00:03:31.910> going<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.120> have<00:03:32.240> a<00:03:32.270> look

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
first thing we're going to have a look

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.870 
first thing we're going to have a look
at<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.050> Wikipedia<00:03:33.580> Mobile<00:03:36.880> takes

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
at on this is Wikipedia Mobile takes

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.790 
at on this is Wikipedia Mobile takes
little<00:03:38.150> while<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.480> load<00:03:38.510> up<00:03:38.810> but<00:03:39.470> here<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.770> are

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
little while to load up but here we are

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.530 
little while to load up but here we are
so<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:40.160> is<00:03:40.340> Wikipedia<00:03:40.640> Mobile<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.420> that

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
so this is Wikipedia Mobile and that

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.130 
so this is Wikipedia Mobile and that
loads<00:03:41.780> up<00:03:41.990> just<00:03:42.290> fine<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:47.690> happens<00:03:48.020> when

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
loads up just fine but what happens when

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.600 
loads up just fine but what happens when
you<00:03:48.230> try<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.470> load<00:03:48.650> up<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.830> more<00:03:49.010> complicated

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
you try and load up a more complicated

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.460 
you try and load up a more complicated
page<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.180> case<00:03:50.450> we'll<00:03:50.690> try<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.350> load

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
page so in this case we'll try and load

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:01.120 
page so in this case we'll try and load
up<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.680> full<00:03:51.950> version<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.370> Wikipedia

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
and as you can see it's bombed out

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.840

again<00:04:37.670> as<00:04:38.000> we<00:04:38.060> say<00:04:38.420> if<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:39.020> stick<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.380> basic

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
again as we say if you stick to basic

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.250 
again as we say if you stick to basic
websites<00:04:40.390> you<00:04:41.390> should<00:04:41.420> be<00:04:41.720> able<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:41.960> get<00:04:42.080> miles

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
websites you should be able to get miles

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:52.990 
websites you should be able to get miles
quite<00:04:42.860> well<00:04:43.010> with<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:51.550> there<00:04:52.550> are<00:04:52.670> basic

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
quite well with it there are basic

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.550 
quite well with it there are basic
information<00:04:53.600> management<00:04:53.840> functions<00:04:54.350> on<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
information management functions on the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.100 
information management functions on the
phone<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:56.090> does<00:04:56.270> all<00:04:56.420> the<00:04:56.480> basic<00:04:56.750> things<00:04:56.990> on

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
phone it does all the basic things on

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.880 
phone it does all the basic things on
the<00:04:57.170> back<00:04:57.350> there's<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.040> 1.3<00:04:58.970> megapixel<00:04:59.890> camera

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
the back there's a 1.3 megapixel camera

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.560 
the back there's a 1.3 megapixel camera
but<00:05:03.790> overall<00:05:04.790> we<00:05:04.940> think<00:05:04.970> it's<00:05:05.240> quite<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.450> good

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
but overall we think it's quite a good
