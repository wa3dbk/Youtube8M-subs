in<00:02:08.580> areas<00:02:09.019> I'm<00:02:10.019> gonna<00:02:10.200> try<00:02:10.409> and<00:02:10.470> thin<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:10.890> out

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
in areas I'm gonna try and thin it out

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.619 
in areas I'm gonna try and thin it out
so<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.459> get<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.849> dry<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.239> quickly<00:02:12.450> as

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
so we can get it to dry as quickly as

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.309 
so we can get it to dry as quickly as
possible

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
possible

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.660

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
so all the way around the edge

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.800 
so all the way around the edge
there<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.330> go<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.510> way<00:02:26.629> that

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
cut edge for that okay so I've already

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.710 
cut edge for that okay so I've already
got<00:03:58.130> one<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.519> I've<00:03:58.639> done<00:03:58.760> ahead<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:59.090> time<00:03:59.209> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
got one that I've done ahead of time and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.629 
got one that I've done ahead of time and
I've<00:03:59.810> added<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.169> bit<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.349> mounting<00:04:00.769> foam<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.609> I

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
I've added a bit of mounting foam so I

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.659 
I've added a bit of mounting foam so I
need<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.120> bring<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.510> back<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.680> we'll<00:04:04.639> use

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
need to bring this back and we'll use

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.650 
need to bring this back and we'll use
this<00:04:05.359> as<00:04:05.560> our<00:04:06.560> background<00:04:07.040> for<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.660> I'm

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
this as our background for that I'm

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.089 
this as our background for that I'm
going<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.840> peel<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.230> backing<00:04:09.260> off<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.980> that

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
going to peel the backing off and that

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.530 
going to peel the backing off and that
may<00:04:10.280> still<00:04:10.609> be<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.819> just<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.209> tiny<00:04:11.389> bit<00:04:11.629> damp<00:04:13.540> so

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
may still be it just a tiny bit damp so

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.150 
may still be it just a tiny bit damp so
I'm<00:04:14.629> going<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.870> add<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.049> little<00:04:15.410> bit<00:04:15.650> extra<00:04:15.980> of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
I'm going to add a little bit extra of

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.860 
I'm going to add a little bit extra of
glue<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.880> let<00:04:20.180> me<00:04:20.239> do<00:04:20.720> my<00:04:22.090> glue<00:04:23.090> here<00:04:23.419> get<00:04:23.750> it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
glue and let me do my glue here get it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.280 
glue and let me do my glue here get it
flowing<00:04:24.169> nicely<00:04:25.060> there<00:04:26.060> we<00:04:26.270> go

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.360 

okay<00:04:30.310> now<00:04:31.720> this<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:33.020> when<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.230> add<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:33.740> my<00:04:33.890> Santa

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
now what I've done this I've cut a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.030 
now what I've done this I've cut a
little<00:04:35.690> strip<00:04:35.870> it's<00:04:36.260> about<00:04:36.410> three<00:04:36.680> quarters

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
little strip it's about three quarters

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.450 
little strip it's about three quarters
of<00:04:37.070> an<00:04:37.310> inch<00:04:37.430> long<00:04:37.820> wide<00:04:38.560> by<00:04:39.560> about<00:04:39.770> four

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
of an inch long wide by about four

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.550 
of an inch long wide by about four
inches<00:04:40.670> long<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.060> I've<00:04:41.180> glued<00:04:41.480> a<00:04:41.780> couple<00:04:42.470> of

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
inches long and I've glued a couple of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.590 
inches long and I've glued a couple of
the<00:04:42.740> Santa's<00:04:43.550> on<00:04:43.760> there<00:04:43.970> just<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.330> give<00:04:44.480> it<00:04:44.510> a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
the Santa's on there just to give it a

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.180 
the Santa's on there just to give it a
little<00:04:44.720> bit<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.020> stability<00:04:45.230> I've<00:04:45.680> done<00:04:45.890> two

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
little bit of stability I've done two

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.250 
little bit of stability I've done two
and<00:04:46.220> back<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:47.150> just<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.690> some<00:04:47.840> spray<00:04:48.020> glue

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
and back and just with some spray glue

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.690 
and back and just with some spray glue
between<00:04:48.410> them<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.920> back<00:04:49.130> them<00:04:49.370> so<00:04:49.520> it's<00:04:49.640> a

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
between them to back them so it's a

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.940 
between them to back them so it's a
little<00:04:49.880> bit<00:04:50.090> stronger<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:51.290> I'm<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.680> pop

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
little bit stronger so I'm going to pop

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:02.160 
little bit stronger so I'm going to pop
this<00:04:52.160> into<00:04:52.370> place<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.830> put<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:57.730> in<00:04:58.730> my

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.080 

mounting<00:05:03.170> foam<00:05:03.380> like<00:05:03.650> that<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.550> let's<00:05:04.790> see<00:05:05.030> if

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
mounting foam like that so let's see if

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.710 
mounting foam like that so let's see if
we<00:05:05.180> can<00:05:05.300> get<00:05:05.420> that<00:05:05.600> nice<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.410> flat<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:07.100> there

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
we can get that nice and flat on there

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.330 
we can get that nice and flat on there
there<00:05:08.720> we<00:05:08.870> go<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:11.980> then<00:05:12.980> I'm<00:05:13.040> gonna<00:05:13.160> go<00:05:13.310> ahead

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
there we go and then I'm gonna go ahead

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.110 
there we go and then I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:05:13.550> put<00:05:13.670> it<00:05:13.760> onto<00:05:13.910> my<00:05:14.060> backing<00:05:14.570> card<00:05:16.120> I'll

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
and put it onto my backing card I'll

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:28.630 
and put it onto my backing card I'll
just<00:05:17.300> use<00:05:17.450> a<00:05:17.480> bit<00:05:17.720> extra<00:05:18.020> glue<00:05:18.200> for<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:27.640> that

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
just use a bit extra glue for that that

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.270 
just use a bit extra glue for that that
looks<00:05:28.880> good<00:05:29.120> now<00:05:29.500> when<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.530> did<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:31.070> original

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
looks good now when I did the original

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.810 
looks good now when I did the original
card<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:32.120> did<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.230> ho<00:05:33.410> ho<00:05:33.590> ho<00:05:33.800> in<00:05:33.980> red<00:05:34.250> which

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
card I did the ho ho ho in red which

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.520 
card I did the ho ho ho in red which
I've<00:05:35.000> gone<00:05:35.180> ahead<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:35.480> done<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:35.900> decided<00:05:36.290> I

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
I've gone ahead and done but I decided I

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.990 
I've gone ahead and done but I decided I
thought<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.860> needed<00:05:36.980> a<00:05:37.220> little<00:05:37.490> bit<00:05:37.730> something

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
thought it needed a little bit something

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.750 
thought it needed a little bit something
extra<00:05:38.600> when<00:05:38.720> I<00:05:38.780> finished<00:05:39.170> it<00:05:39.350> so<00:05:39.980> I<00:05:40.010> went<00:05:40.670> ahead

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
extra when I finished it so I went ahead

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.140 
extra when I finished it so I went ahead
and<00:05:41.000> did<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.080> red<00:05:42.200> ones<00:05:42.470> but<00:05:42.770> put<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.430> a<00:05:43.670> little

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
and did the red ones but put in a little

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.330 
and did the red ones but put in a little
tiny<00:05:44.540> black<00:05:44.930> shadow<00:05:45.320> by<00:05:45.560> cutting<00:05:45.860> it<00:05:45.980> again<00:05:46.220> in

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
tiny black shadow by cutting it again in

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.770 
tiny black shadow by cutting it again in
black<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.790> mounting<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.210> behind<00:05:47.420> just

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
black and mounting it behind just

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.870 
black and mounting it behind just
slightly<00:05:48.140> offset<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:49.280> I'm<00:05:49.370> going<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.730> go<00:05:49.820> ahead

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
slightly offset so I'm going to go ahead

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.280 
slightly offset so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:50.120> use<00:05:50.240> this<00:05:50.450> one<00:05:50.630> you<00:05:50.780> can<00:05:50.900> tell<00:05:51.050> me<00:05:51.170> which

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
and use this one you can tell me which

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.710 
and use this one you can tell me which
one<00:05:51.470> you<00:05:51.530> like<00:05:51.710> better<00:05:52.540> sometimes<00:05:53.540> I<00:05:53.660> think

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
one you like better sometimes I think

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.690 
one you like better sometimes I think
it's<00:05:53.990> just<00:05:54.230> a<00:05:54.440> difference<00:05:54.800> between<00:05:55.250> something

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
it's just a difference between something

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.850 
it's just a difference between something
very<00:05:56.210> fine<00:05:56.570> like<00:05:56.810> that<00:05:56.840> that<00:05:57.230> makes<00:05:57.440> all<00:05:57.710> the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
very fine like that that makes all the

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.030 
very fine like that that makes all the
difference<00:05:57.890> in<00:05:58.280> your<00:05:58.400> card<00:05:59.650> put<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.740> little<00:06:00.920> bit

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
difference in your card put a little bit

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.420 
difference in your card put a little bit
of<00:06:01.160> glue<00:06:01.370> around<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.880> back<00:06:02.120> on<00:06:02.360> this<00:06:03.430> will

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
of glue around the back on this will

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.860 
of glue around the back on this will
seat<00:06:04.670> it<00:06:04.790> right<00:06:05.000> in<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.300> center<00:06:05.510> of<00:06:05.750> that

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
seat it right in the center of that

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:15.780 
seat it right in the center of that
opening<00:06:07.630> there<00:06:08.630> we<00:06:08.780> go

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.630 

and<00:06:16.790> voila<00:06:17.660> we<00:06:18.080> are<00:06:18.230> finished<00:06:18.680> I'll<00:06:19.340> tell<00:06:19.580> you
