my<00:00:40.379> hair<00:00:40.769> is<00:00:41.120> discolored<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.050> colored<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
my hair is discolored but I colored it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
my hair is discolored but I colored it
to<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:44.010> natural<00:00:44.159> color<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.659> is<00:00:45.690> basically

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
to my natural color so this is basically

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.520 
to my natural color so this is basically
the<00:00:46.679> exact<00:00:46.949> see<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.429> my<00:00:47.609> natural<00:00:48.030> color<00:00:48.530> um

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the exact see with my natural color um

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.910 
the exact see with my natural color um
and<00:00:50.449> from<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> medium<00:00:52.079> brown<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:52.769> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and from a medium brown it's not to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.739 
and from a medium brown it's not to
confer<00:00:53.429> in<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.359> I'm<00:00:54.899> hoping<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:57.510> won't

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
confer in it so I'm hoping that it won't

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.719 
confer in it so I'm hoping that it won't
go<00:00:57.929> coffee<00:00:58.229> I'll<00:00:58.739> make<00:00:58.979> sure<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.249> leave<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> on

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
go coffee I'll make sure I leave it on

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.610 
go coffee I'll make sure I leave it on
long<00:00:59.909> maps<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.449> sure<00:01:00.569> it's<00:01:00.690> blonde<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:03.620> ok

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
long maps to make sure it's blonde so ok

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
long maps to make sure it's blonde so ok
so<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> bleach<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.060> chose<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.540> use<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:07.050> is

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
so the bleach that I chose to use is is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.930 
so the bleach that I chose to use is is
revlon<00:01:08.640> frost<00:01:09.120> and<00:01:09.360> glow<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.860> usually<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
revlon frost and glow I usually get the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.730 
revlon frost and glow I usually get the
frosting<00:01:12.480> tip<00:01:12.690> one<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.230> red<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:13.920> um<00:01:15.740> because

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
frosting tip one the red one um because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
frosting tip one the red one um because
it<00:01:17.400> gives<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.660> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.870> have<00:01:18.960> colored

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it gives you like if you have colored

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
it gives you like if you have colored
hair<00:01:19.620> darker<00:01:20.040> hair<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.610> gives<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.180> like

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
hair darker hair it gives you like

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.830 
hair darker hair it gives you like
really<00:01:21.840> bold<00:01:22.170> bright<00:01:22.830> blonde<00:01:23.730> streaks<00:01:24.210> but

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
really bold bright blonde streaks but

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.160 
really bold bright blonde streaks but
this<00:01:25.050> one<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.620> also
