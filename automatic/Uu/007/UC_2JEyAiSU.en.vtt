we<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.689> Masons<00:02:01.229> very<00:02:01.979> interesting<00:02:02.520> they

look kind of weird

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.319 
look kind of weird
I<00:02:03.689> suppose<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.560> look<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.369> similar<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
I suppose they look a bit similar to the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.050 
I suppose they look a bit similar to the
done<00:02:06.750> Marc<00:02:07.049> maces<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.979> we've<00:02:08.129> seen<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
done Marc maces that we've seen just the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
done Marc maces that we've seen just the
shape<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> mace<00:02:09.690> head<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
shape of the mace head and the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.220 
shape of the mace head and the
I<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:12.090> literally<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.750> shape<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I like literally the shape of the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.080 
I like literally the shape of the
paddles<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.800> may<00:02:14.070> set<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
paddles on the may set they do have a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.940 
paddles on the may set they do have a
little<00:02:15.390> bit<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> an<00:02:15.690> ornate<00:02:15.990> like<00:02:16.170> vine<00:02:16.500> design

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
little bit of an ornate like vine design

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.070 
little bit of an ornate like vine design
on<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.340> which<00:02:17.430> makes<00:02:17.640> unique<00:02:18.270> now<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
on it which makes unique now on to the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.480 
on it which makes unique now on to the
two-handed<00:02:19.620> weapons<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.100> have<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
two-handed weapons we have the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.670 
two-handed weapons we have the
two-handed<00:02:21.120> axe<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.600> battle<00:02:21.990> axe<00:02:22.200> it's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
two-handed axe the battle axe it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830 
two-handed axe the battle axe it's
pretty<00:02:22.890> nice<00:02:23.040> looking<00:02:23.190> axe<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.570> most

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pretty nice looking axe like with most

pretty nice looking axe like with most
other<00:02:25.140> axes<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.580> pretty

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
other axes we do see that it's pretty

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.850 
other axes we do see that it's pretty
much<00:02:26.790> -<00:02:27.180> one-handed<00:02:27.780> axes<00:02:28.140> glued<00:02:28.380> back<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
much - one-handed axes glued back to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.740 
much - one-handed axes glued back to
back<00:02:29.070> but<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.520> looks<00:02:29.670> cool<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> design

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
back but it looks cool I like the design

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.240 
back but it looks cool I like the design
on<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.080> blade<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.500> looks<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:31.980> cool<00:02:32.100> like

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
on the blade it looks really cool like

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.350 
on the blade it looks really cool like
that<00:02:32.310> doubled<00:02:33.000> over

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that doubled over

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.700 
that doubled over
next<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> two<00:02:34.080> handers<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
next up of the two handers we have the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.230 
next up of the two handers we have the
two<00:02:34.890> ended<00:02:35.100> saw<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> great<00:02:35.730> sword<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240

Claymore<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:37.050> cool<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.560> basically<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
Claymore very cool it is basically a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800 
Claymore very cool it is basically a
bigger<00:02:38.430> version<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.970> one-handed<00:02:39.480> sword

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
bigger version of the one-handed sword

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.170 
bigger version of the one-handed sword
nonetheless<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.800> really<00:02:41.190> cool<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.970> think

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
it has you've got the same length a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.490 
it has you've got the same length a
smaller<00:02:45.180> handle<00:02:45.630> than<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.810> one-handed<00:02:46.260> sword

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
smaller handle than the one-handed sword

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.200 
smaller handle than the one-handed sword
interesting<00:02:47.220> wow<00:02:47.430> that's<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.820> really<00:02:48.060> cool

interesting wow that's a really cool

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.060 
interesting wow that's a really cool
hand<00:02:48.480> guard<00:02:48.690> that's<00:02:49.170> interesting<00:02:49.680> right<00:02:49.920> in

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
hand guard that's interesting right in

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.770 
hand guard that's interesting right in
the<00:02:50.160> middle<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> handguard<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.420> there

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the middle of the handguard that there

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.690 
the middle of the handguard that there
is<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.110> full<00:02:52.530> symbol<00:02:53.100> for<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:53.490> knives

is the full symbol for my knives
which<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.630> equivalent<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.170> em<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.830> can

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
which is the equivalent of em you can

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.140 
which is the equivalent of em you can
see<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.250> look<00:02:56.400> kind<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.670> looks<00:02:56.820> like<00:02:56.850> an<00:02:57.030> M

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
see they look kind of looks like an M

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.970 
see they look kind of looks like an M
with<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.810> couple<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.050> extra<00:02:58.260> lines<00:02:58.500> thrown<00:02:58.830> in

with a couple of extra lines thrown in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.800 
with a couple of extra lines thrown in
don't<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.760> why<00:02:59.880> they've<00:03:00.060> put<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.600> there

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.780 
don't know why they've put that on there
keep<00:03:01.350> plotting<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> two<00:03:02.310> hand<00:03:02.550> as<00:03:02.670> we

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
keep plotting on with the two hand as we

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.250 
keep plotting on with the two hand as we
got<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> two-handed<00:03:03.360> mace<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.810> Warhammer

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
got the two-handed mace the Warhammer

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
got the two-handed mace the Warhammer
them<00:03:04.530> all<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.030> different<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
them all a little bit different to the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.060 
them all a little bit different to the
one-handed<00:03:07.080> mace<00:03:07.260> actually<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.710> think<00:03:07.800> there's

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
one-handed mace actually I think there's

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.460 
one-handed mace actually I think there's
a<00:03:08.130> bit<00:03:08.280> more<00:03:08.310> action<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.300> towards<00:03:09.660> where

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
a bit more action going on towards where

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.370 
a bit more action going on towards where
the<00:03:10.970> head<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.120> mace<00:03:12.270> meets<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> shaft<00:03:12.990> I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the head of the mace meets the shaft I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.600 
the head of the mace meets the shaft I
don't<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:13.800> me<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.070> looks<00:03:14.190> weird<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:14.580> a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
don't know to me it looks weird for a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.760 
don't know to me it looks weird for a
mace<00:03:14.760> now<00:03:15.300> next<00:03:15.600> up<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.230> daggers

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
mace now next up we have the daggers

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.949 
mace now next up we have the daggers
again<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.910> see<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.209> pretty<00:03:18.450> much<00:03:18.600> every

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
again like we see in pretty much every

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.290 
again like we see in pretty much every
single<00:03:19.170> style<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.860> basically<00:03:20.160> a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
single style it's basically a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
single style it's basically a
scaled-down<00:03:21.300> version<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.050> headed

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
scaled-down version of the one headed

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.660 
scaled-down version of the one headed
sword<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.620> think<00:03:22.770> it's<00:03:22.890> got<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.070> same<00:03:23.190> blade<00:03:23.520> to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
sword I think it's got the same blade to

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.330 
sword I think it's got the same blade to
handle<00:03:23.970> ratio<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.570> did<00:03:24.930> enjoy<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.650> design<00:03:26.130> of

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
handle ratio I did enjoy the design of

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370 
handle ratio I did enjoy the design of
the<00:03:26.430> one-handed<00:03:26.820> swords<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.630> do<00:03:27.720> enjoy<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the one-handed swords and I do enjoy the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.560 
the one-handed swords and I do enjoy the
design<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.890> these<00:03:29.070> daggers<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
design of these daggers now we have the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.930 
design of these daggers now we have the
bow<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.320> quiver<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.739> quite<00:03:31.950> ornate<00:03:32.160> isn't<00:03:32.850> it

pretty cool it doesn't really have too

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.660 
pretty cool it doesn't really have too
much<00:04:12.690> gem<00:04:13.080> action<00:04:13.440> going<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:13.860> but<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> design
