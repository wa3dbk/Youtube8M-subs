these<00:01:27.229> aesthetically<00:01:28.189> pleasing<00:01:29.020> yeah<00:01:30.020> I'll

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
these aesthetically pleasing yeah I'll

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.929 
these aesthetically pleasing yeah I'll
just<00:01:30.439> stumble<00:01:30.979> over<00:01:31.009> my<00:01:31.159> words<00:01:31.249> there<00:01:31.700> don't

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
just stumble over my words there don't

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.309 
just stumble over my words there don't
mind<00:01:32.149> me<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:34.149> nice<00:01:35.149> chrome<00:01:35.869> finish

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
mind me and so it's nice chrome finish

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.449 
mind me and so it's nice chrome finish
and<00:01:37.389> then<00:01:38.389> on<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.840> back<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.289> some<00:01:40.069> probably

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
and then on the back is some probably

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:41.830 
and then on the back is some probably
glass<00:01:40.700> I'm<00:01:40.909> guessing<00:01:41.270> with<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.539> apple<00:01:41.810> logo

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
glass I'm guessing with the apple logo

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.789 
glass I'm guessing with the apple logo
and<00:01:42.939> then<00:01:43.939> on<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.240> side<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.689> have<00:01:44.810> your<00:01:44.990> power

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
and then on the side you have your power

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.370 
and then on the side you have your power
button<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.549> berries<00:01:47.209> probably<00:01:47.899> no<00:01:47.990> batteries

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
button the berries probably no batteries

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.239 
button the berries probably no batteries
I'm<00:01:48.499> guessing<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.840> yeah<00:01:51.020> that's<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:52.009> just

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
I'm guessing and so yeah that's it just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.769 
I'm guessing and so yeah that's it just
sits<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.789> you<00:01:55.789> can<00:01:55.939> use<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.149> like<00:01:56.719> a

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:56.779 
sits like that and you can use it like a

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:00.459 
sits like that and you can use it like a
mouse<00:01:57.079> no<00:01:58.069> so<00:01:58.969> it's<00:01:59.539> not<00:01:59.719> much<00:01:59.959> to<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.319> really

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
mouse no so it's not much to it really

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.530 
mouse no so it's not much to it really
hits

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540

battery-operated<00:02:04.450> those<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.260> you<00:02:05.290> just<00:02:05.560> I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
battery-operated those so you just I

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.710 
battery-operated those so you just I
think<00:02:06.220> once<00:02:06.460> every<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.790> two<00:02:07.330> three<00:02:07.360> months

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
think once every like two three months

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.660 
think once every like two three months
probably<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.290> guessing<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:09.430> have<00:02:09.550> to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
probably I'm guessing you have to

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.940 
probably I'm guessing you have to
replace<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.149> batteries<00:02:10.540> but<00:02:10.810> that's<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.440> small

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
replace the batteries but that's a small

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.480 
replace the batteries but that's a small
price<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.910> pay<00:02:12.940> for<00:02:14.070> all<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> conveniences
