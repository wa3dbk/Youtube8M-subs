woodwork<00:00:11.910> here's<00:00:12.630> how<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:12.960> done

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
woodwork here's how it's done

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.980 
woodwork here's how it's done
firstly<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.000> raise<00:00:15.299> your<00:00:15.330> saw<00:00:15.719> blade

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
firstly you have to raise your saw blade

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.720 
firstly you have to raise your saw blade
to<00:00:16.199> make<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> partial<00:00:16.770> cut<00:00:17.160> through<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.550> work

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
to make a partial cut through your work

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.880 
to make a partial cut through your work
and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> find<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> best<00:00:19.020> thing<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.410> mark<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and I find the best thing is to mark the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
and I find the best thing is to mark the
dimension<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> block<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.090> wood<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.570> then

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
dimension on a block of wood and then

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
dimension on a block of wood and then
put<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> left<00:00:23.160> side<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.609> saw<00:00:23.789> blade<00:00:24.060> slot<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
put a left side of saw blade slot and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960 
put a left side of saw blade slot and
then<00:00:25.170> razor<00:00:25.439> blade<00:00:25.859> until<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> lowest<00:00:26.640> tooth

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
then razor blade until the lowest tooth

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.990 
then razor blade until the lowest tooth
is<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.930> opposite<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> pencil<00:00:28.920> line<00:00:29.070> then

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
is just opposite the pencil line then

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.410 
is just opposite the pencil line then
lock<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> saw<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.140> remove<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> block<00:00:32.390> now<00:00:33.390> I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
lock the saw and remove the block now I

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049 
lock the saw and remove the block now I
often<00:00:33.750> find<00:00:34.140> myself<00:00:34.230> doing<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.460> pieces

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
often find myself doing these on pieces

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.770 
often find myself doing these on pieces
two<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.809> four<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> time<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.879> I've<00:00:39.480> taped

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
two and four at a time and so I've taped

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
two and four at a time and so I've taped
my<00:00:40.050> pieces<00:00:40.290> together<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> ends<00:00:41.340> inline

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
my pieces together with the ends inline

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.360 
my pieces together with the ends inline
using<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:42.690> inducting<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.710> masking<00:00:44.100> tape

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
using very inducting or masking tape

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.220 
using very inducting or masking tape
which<00:00:44.850> might<00:00:45.059> actually<00:00:45.090> pack<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:45.989> from

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
which might actually pack you out from

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.799 
which might actually pack you out from
the<00:00:46.320> fence<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> I've<00:00:47.760> only<00:00:47.910> marked<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> my

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the fence and I've only marked one of my

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.330 
the fence and I've only marked one of my
pieces<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> be

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
pieces the one that's going to be

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
pieces the one that's going to be
closest<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> fence<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> defining

cuts of where I want my rebate now you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
cuts of where I want my rebate now you
may<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.160> wondering<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.969> packing

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
may be wondering what this packing

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.750 
may be wondering what this packing
spacer<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> parallel

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
screwed to the MDF sub fences and when

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.820 
screwed to the MDF sub fences and when
my<00:01:06.540> blade<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.049> full<00:01:07.260> depth

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
my blade was at full depth

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
my blade was at full depth
I<00:01:07.860> made<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> cut<00:01:08.430> through<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.689> ensure

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I made a cut through there to ensure

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
I made a cut through there to ensure
that<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.409> edge<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.979> exactly<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.670> line<00:01:11.850> with

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that this edge is exactly in line with

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
that this edge is exactly in line with
my<00:01:12.299> blade<00:01:12.570> notch<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.040> use<00:01:14.070> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
my blade notch so I can now use this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570 
my blade notch so I can now use this
edge<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.600> site<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.080> alongside<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.250> pencil

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
edge to site up alongside my pencil

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.690 
edge to site up alongside my pencil
marks<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> other<00:01:19.710> reasons<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.220> having<00:01:20.430> the

marks the other reasons for having the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
marks the other reasons for having the
spacer<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.350> lower<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.040> MDF

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
spacer is that it's lower than the MDF

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.550 
spacer is that it's lower than the MDF
fences<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.600> wrap<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:24.960> fingers<00:01:25.200> around

fences so I can wrap my fingers around
the<00:01:25.890> wood<00:01:26.130> keep<00:01:26.700> better<00:01:26.909> control<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the wood keep better control of it and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
the wood keep better control of it and
still<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.799> nice<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> square<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:30.000> work
