00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
 well now we're going to one thing 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.080
 that it was very curious the moment 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 determined looking at a road we 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 we realized that the steam that went out to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.499
 heat the milk was a special steam 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 not with or with as much pressure and as 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.699
 We had in the dance centers 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.019
 the steam ovens nor the same as 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.770
 does in a Chinese steamer like this 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.050
 and so not and then because you could 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.469
 do a very important thing that is that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 in here in one had is coffee maker 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.990
 domestic as the deposit is not included 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.730
 to 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.800
 to this to the water network because here you 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.240
 we put an infusion of what is a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.240
 light salsita 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.390
 an apple juice or whatever and then 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.790
 we choose we put here in the liquid 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.820
 We've gotten good in a bag that 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.040
 homeland here or never in an equal face 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.730
 we have put some 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.470
 carabineros in one in a vacuum bag 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.140
 but it is not necessary in that vacuum that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.430
 it can be a bag without more is left like this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.310
 a little hole and it can be in a jar 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.770
 and I know 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 now 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.830
 generates pressure 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 at 40 seconds it's done already look 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.729
 the good thing you have to know a little 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 has for sale only if you have this 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.549
 Well oranges to orange, but not good 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 What it has is that the texture 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.729
 get this way you do not get 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.490
 with no other device this from 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.460
 cooking that's the good thing to try methods 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.720
 an herb if that and the truth is that it was 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.000
 a great discovery of ours 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.000
 It's nice and roasted
