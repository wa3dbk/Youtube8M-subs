00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 so hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 harris and in this video i will show you my 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.990
 new mechanism 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 although in fact this thing can 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.389
 crank up and in quite and in older 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.639
 versions for example there in 179 but for some reason 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 I got a fool just now shorter 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.529
 mechanism portal to mars like him at all 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 working we build a regular portal by 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 form resembling a portal to hell only in 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.170
 we will be from red baked clay 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 give in general we build when we 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.689
 finish 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.550
 build we appear so beautiful 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.600
 particles this means that the portal is ready 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.270
 of use 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 and when we enter in it then it is from 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.910
 will transfer to Mars vodka it all looks 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.430
 pretty believable and that's how you see 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 reception with really mass 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.239
 I think it is not difficult to guess that all this 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.309
 that's all that's what you see 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 built himself and no one to mars at the very 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.539
 There is no business but in principle using 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 mechanism can make a portal to the moon 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 portals to america although in general where 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.059
 want since everything works for a very 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 simple principle there is only 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.229
 work until a command that is etc. and test 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.799
 for this for checks if you are in 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.080
 the portal 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.240
 if you have it then do you port in 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 right moment that is heavenly and time it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 maybe everything you want and since 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 everything works like this to see the system 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.460
 all but you do not get scared and just 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.009
 I will do not quite compact in general 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.580
 starts with the plug-in rotaru I think everything 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.100
 Metro build on 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 time he goes in different directions is a branch 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.670
 blocks command is responsible for the portal itself is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.650
 is when you need to build a portal 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.780
 the signal goes on then here is normal 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.950
 team sport unit coordinates each 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.560
 block and aide quilling means there 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.799
 the portal is built now it is ready therefore 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.530
 pass again means work from 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.050
 the commander of the command unit spann spannit 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.300
 damn quartz tonneau at these coordinates and 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.119
 glide this where the cattle and now i'm 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.030
 set who knows naturally teaches 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.979
 work these columns and here they are spawned 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 constantly pieces of lava let it just 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.020
 decor effect just to be more beautiful 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 that is, the target team and how from the player 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.979
 it turns out that mango is constantly 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.860
 checks the availability of players quarter 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.110
 if the player in the quarter has a price 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 passes on to these command blocks a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.860
 that's all 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.940
 deportation and the effect of blindness 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.050
 everything just goes on for 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 plausibility 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.600
 and further teleportation you need to place 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.220
 all map commands will be under video so 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.380
 what if someone doesnâ€™t understand 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.410
 also very soon will be my new 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.350
 old may render the card ration master 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.380
 she has been on the channel for a long time but 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.320
 external did not get around to do it and in 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.480
 In principle, it is almost ready so 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.480
 subscribe and wait and all bye
