00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.660 
one nice thing to do is spin it and just
eyeball<00:05:26.140> down<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.010> center<00:05:27.310> line<00:05:27.340> of<00:05:27.520> your

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
eyeball down the center line of your

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.670 
eyeball down the center line of your
tubular<00:05:28.180> just<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.960> make<00:05:28.990> sure<00:05:29.170> it's<00:05:29.530> on<00:05:29.620> there

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
tubular just to make sure it's on there

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.060 
tubular just to make sure it's on there
straight<00:05:30.160> okay<00:05:30.940> that's<00:05:31.090> very<00:05:31.300> important<00:05:31.660> part

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
straight okay that's very important part

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.800 
straight okay that's very important part
once<00:05:33.070> that's<00:05:33.250> done<00:05:33.550> go<00:05:33.610> ahead<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.300> inflate<00:05:34.630> it

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
once that's done go ahead and inflate it

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.060 
once that's done go ahead and inflate it
here's<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.800> most<00:05:35.950> important<00:05:36.430> part<00:05:36.640> okay<00:05:38.070> 125

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
here's the most important part okay 125

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.280 
here's the most important part okay 125
psi<00:05:39.670> is<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.120> ideal<00:05:40.420> pressure<00:05:40.750> for<00:05:41.080> any

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
psi is the ideal pressure for any

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.460 
psi is the ideal pressure for any
tubular<00:05:41.830> on<00:05:42.010> an<00:05:42.520> asphalt<00:05:43.030> course<00:05:43.450> you<00:05:44.260> have<00:05:44.380> to

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
tubular on an asphalt course you have to

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.410 
tubular on an asphalt course you have to
remember<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.770> word<00:05:45.010> I<00:05:45.100> asphalt<00:05:45.580> even<00:05:46.330> though

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
remember that word I asphalt even though

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.010 
remember that word I asphalt even though
the<00:05:46.540> tire<00:05:46.750> says<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.170> will<00:05:47.230> hold<00:05:47.410> 220<00:05:48.840> 125<00:05:49.840> is

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
the tire says it will hold 220 125 is

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.560 
the tire says it will hold 220 125 is
ideal<00:05:50.320> for<00:05:50.530> an<00:05:50.620> asphalt<00:05:50.920> course<00:05:51.280> that<00:05:52.270> allows

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
ideal for an asphalt course that allows
