00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
on different ways to handle rift

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.109 
on different ways to handle rift
controls<00:00:19.100> yeah<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.369> I've<00:00:20.490> made<00:00:20.609> myself<00:00:20.760> really

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
controls yeah so I've made myself really

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.730 
controls yeah so I've made myself really
small<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> corner<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
small in the corner so if you have a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
small in the corner so if you have a
rift<00:00:23.070> yourself<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.910> should<00:00:24.480> hopefully<00:00:24.630> we'll

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
rift yourself you should hopefully we'll

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
rift yourself you should hopefully we'll
be<00:00:25.080> able<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> see

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

as some mountain blade I'm like really

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.469 
as some mountain blade I'm like really
curious<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.430> see<00:04:18.489> how<00:04:18.699> they<00:04:18.850> implement<00:04:19.329> this

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
curious to see how they implement this

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.810 
curious to see how they implement this
one<00:04:19.690> because<00:04:19.989> it's<00:04:20.199> not<00:04:20.259> really<00:04:20.620> a

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
one because it's not really a

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.680 
one because it's not really a
first-person<00:04:21.820> game<00:04:22.210> it's<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:24.690> top-down

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
first-person game it's like a top-down

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.120 
first-person game it's like a top-down
third<00:04:26.350> person<00:04:26.710> game

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.860 

well<00:04:30.130> there's<00:04:30.550> top<00:04:30.729> down<00:04:30.940> for<00:04:31.300> like<00:04:31.720> when

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
well there's top down for like when

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.740 
well there's top down for like when
you're<00:04:31.960> looking<00:04:32.020> at<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.320> map<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.539> you'll<00:04:34.539> see

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you're looking at the map and you'll see

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.529 
you're looking at the map and you'll see
you'll<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.169> when<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.380> game<00:04:35.530> starts<00:04:36.539> alright

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
you'll see when the game starts alright

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.620 
you'll see when the game starts alright
so<00:04:38.759> this<00:04:39.759> game<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.090> mount<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.930> blade<00:04:42.630> right

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
so this game is mount and blade right

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.510 
so this game is mount and blade right
now<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:43.840> can't<00:04:44.259> this<00:04:44.680> game<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.190> initially

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.439 
I can move in that way this way and for
a<00:05:28.599> third<00:05:29.050> person<00:05:29.199> control<00:05:29.680> that's<00:05:29.830> actually

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
a third person control that's actually

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.610 
a third person control that's actually
yeah<00:05:31.449> that's<00:05:31.630> pretty<00:05:32.110> cool<00:05:32.229> that's<00:05:32.409> what<00:05:32.530> I

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
yeah that's pretty cool that's what I

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.860 
yeah that's pretty cool that's what I
would<00:05:32.800> expect<00:05:33.090> kind<00:05:34.090> of<00:05:34.180> feels<00:05:34.599> kind<00:05:34.810> of

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
would expect kind of feels kind of

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.279 
would expect kind of feels kind of
natural<00:05:36.060> all<00:05:37.060> right<00:05:37.180> let's<00:05:37.509> say<00:05:37.720> I'm<00:05:37.870> standing

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
natural all right let's say I'm standing

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.029 
natural all right let's say I'm standing
still<00:05:39.330> look<00:05:40.330> over<00:05:40.599> my<00:05:40.720> left<00:05:40.900> shoulder<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.530> look

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
still look over my left shoulder I look

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.390 
still look over my left shoulder I look
that<00:05:42.729> way<00:05:43.470> look<00:05:44.470> over<00:05:44.680> my<00:05:44.830> right<00:05:44.860> shoulder

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
that way look over my right shoulder

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:55.770 
that way look over my right shoulder
I'll<00:05:45.759> spin<00:05:46.120> 180<00:05:46.810> degrees<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:47.590> way

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.590 

actually<00:05:56.780> feels<00:05:56.930> really<00:05:57.440> natural<00:05:57.699> like<00:05:58.699> if

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
actually feels really natural like if

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.150 
actually feels really natural like if
you<00:05:59.810> were<00:05:59.990> to<00:06:00.110> do<00:06:00.229> a<00:06:00.260> third<00:06:00.530> person<00:06:00.860> game<00:06:01.010> for

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
you were to do a third person game for

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.560 
you were to do a third person game for
the<00:06:01.220> rift<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.580> would<00:06:01.699> say<00:06:01.850> this<00:06:02.000> is<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.389> way<00:06:02.510> to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
the rift I would say this is the way to

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.680 
the rift I would say this is the way to
do<00:06:02.840> it<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.320> mean<00:06:04.220> just<00:06:04.460> use<00:06:04.669> the<00:06:04.970> rift<00:06:05.300> as<00:06:05.479> a<00:06:05.510> way

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
do it I mean just use the rift as a way

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.000 
do it I mean just use the rift as a way
to<00:06:05.750> orbit<00:06:06.229> around<00:06:06.380> your<00:06:06.680> character<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:09.410> just

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
to orbit around your character it just

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.600 
to orbit around your character it just
feels<00:06:10.190> good<00:06:12.430> so<00:06:13.430> here<00:06:13.610> we<00:06:13.729> are<00:06:13.760> at<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.870> game's

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
feels good so here we are at the game's

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.100 
feels good so here we are at the game's
overhead<00:06:16.610> map<00:06:16.850> which<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.540> default<00:06:17.900> view

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
overhead map which is the default view

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.170 
overhead map which is the default view
for<00:06:18.470> when<00:06:18.620> you're<00:06:18.740> not<00:06:18.979> in<00:06:19.220> a<00:06:19.370> city<00:06:19.639> or<00:06:19.729> in<00:06:20.090> a

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
for when you're not in a city or in a

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.650 
for when you're not in a city or in a
fight<00:06:21.190> this<00:06:22.190> is<00:06:22.250> where<00:06:22.550> you<00:06:22.669> like<00:06:23.150> travel<00:06:23.570> the

fight this is where you like travel the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.090 
fight this is where you like travel the
world<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:25.510> navigating<00:06:26.510> this<00:06:26.740> feels<00:06:27.740> a<00:06:27.979> little

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
world and navigating this feels a little

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.120 
world and navigating this feels a little
strange<00:06:28.580> oh<00:06:28.970> look<00:06:29.240> there's<00:06:29.540> my<00:06:29.600> mouse<00:06:30.130> so
