sell more and make more money by selling
to<00:00:33.149> several<00:00:33.480> figures<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:34.920> they

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to several figures but you know if they

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.440 
to several figures but you know if they
would<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.000> step<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
would do the right thing and step up to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.610 
would do the right thing and step up to
the<00:00:36.480> plate<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.290> would<00:00:37.590> be

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the plate then you know we would be

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.069 
the plate then you know we would be
really<00:00:37.860> cool<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:39.510> part<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
really cool to have that as part of the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
really cool to have that as part of the
figure<00:00:40.320> rather<00:00:40.500> than<00:00:40.680> buying<00:00:41.129> two<00:00:41.489> figures

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
figure rather than buying two figures

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
figure rather than buying two figures
and<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.570> you're<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.750> buying<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.320> second

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and all you're really buying the second

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.119 
and all you're really buying the second
figure<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> head<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.980> enough<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
figure is for the head so enough of that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.810 
figure is for the head so enough of that
rant<00:00:49.010> well<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> kind<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> leads

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
rant well actually that kind of leads

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
rant well actually that kind of leads
into<00:00:50.969> another<00:00:51.090> rant<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.140> he's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
into another rant you can see how he's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.660 
into another rant you can see how he's
holding<00:00:52.440> his<00:00:52.620> weapon<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.340> really

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
holding his weapon which is not really

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
holding his weapon which is not really
the<00:00:54.000> greatest<00:00:54.390> pose<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the greatest pose at all and I the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.160 
the greatest pose at all and I the
reason<00:00:56.699> why<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.050> way

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
reason why that is is because the way

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.569 
reason why that is is because the way
that<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> area<00:01:01.289> near<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> grip<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that the the area near the grip is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
that the the area near the grip is
sculpted<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> there

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
sculpted here you can see that there

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.690 
sculpted here you can see that there
really<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.729> no<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.540> physical<00:01:06.990> way<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.830> fit

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
really is no really physical way to fit

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
really is no really physical way to fit
this<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.119> his<00:01:09.240> hand<00:01:09.540> around<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.140> grip<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
this in his hand around the grip or the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.000 
this in his hand around the grip or the
handle<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.360> weapon<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.930> mean<00:01:13.530> there's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
handle of this weapon I mean there's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
handle of this weapon I mean there's
just<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.460> plastic<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.060> needs<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.390> cut

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just this plastic here needs to be cut

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.850 
just this plastic here needs to be cut
away<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.340> understand<00:01:17.790> why

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
away I really don't understand why

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.670 
away I really don't understand why
McFarland<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.460> particular<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> mean<00:01:21.119> I've<00:01:21.390> had

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
McFarland in particular I mean I've had

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
McFarland in particular I mean I've had
these<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.159> third<00:01:23.400> halo<00:01:23.970> reach<00:01:24.210> figure

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
these this is my third halo reach figure

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
these this is my third halo reach figure
so<00:01:24.750> far<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.439> three<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:25.979> have

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so far and all three of them have

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
so far and all three of them have
problems<00:01:26.310> holding<00:01:26.759> their<00:01:27.030> weapons<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
problems holding their weapons you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.780 
problems holding their weapons you
either<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> alter<00:01:28.770> their<00:01:28.920> fingers<00:01:29.369> or

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
either have to alter their fingers or

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
either have to alter their fingers or
cut<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.360> plastic<00:01:30.810> away<00:01:31.079> from<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> hand

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
cut a little plastic away from the hand

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
cut a little plastic away from the hand
or<00:01:32.490> perhaps<00:01:32.700> even<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.210> case<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> weapon

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
or perhaps even in this case the weapon

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
or perhaps even in this case the weapon
to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> figures<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> hold<00:01:35.670> them

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to get the figures to hold them

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.980 
to get the figures to hold them
correctly<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:37.470> sure<00:01:37.680> why<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.990> maybe

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
correctly so not sure why that is maybe

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
correctly so not sure why that is maybe
I'm<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.350> being<00:01:40.650> creative<00:01:41.369> enough<00:01:41.579> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I'm just not being creative enough in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.910 
I'm just not being creative enough in
thinking<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.570> how<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
thinking about how to actually have the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410 
thinking about how to actually have the
figures<00:01:44.159> hold<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> weapons<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.000> mean

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
figures hold the weapons but I mean

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.850 
figures hold the weapons but I mean
explain<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> me<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.170> figure<00:01:46.740> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
explain to me how this figure is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.780 
explain to me how this figure is

rotation and a bend at the elbow same

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.570 
rotation and a bend at the elbow same
thing<00:03:55.330> at<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.720> wrist<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:58.890> then<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.950> have<00:04:00.160> a

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
thing at the wrist and then you have a

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.870 
thing at the wrist and then you have a
particular<00:04:02.070> there<00:04:03.070> is<00:04:03.220> no<00:04:03.580> waste

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
particular there is no waste

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.310 
particular there is no waste
articulation<00:04:04.540> but<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.690> don't<00:04:04.870> think<00:04:05.050> he<00:04:05.110> really

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
articulation but I don't think he really

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.600 
articulation but I don't think he really
needs<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:05.860> this<00:04:06.370> case<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:06.880> then<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:07.810> have

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
needs it in this case and then you have

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.600 
needs it in this case and then you have
basically<00:04:09.610> swivel<00:04:10.590> thigh<00:04:11.590> or<00:04:11.920> let<00:04:12.190> our<00:04:12.400> hips

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
basically swivel thigh or let our hips

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.850 
basically swivel thigh or let our hips
but<00:04:13.269> then<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.480> have<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.690> rotation<00:04:14.140> here<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.769> you

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
but then you have a rotation here so you

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.099 
but then you have a rotation here so you
can<00:04:14.980> actually<00:04:15.359> move<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.419> leg<00:04:16.690> up<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:16.989> then

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
can actually move the leg up and then

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.960 
can actually move the leg up and then
rotate<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.500> into<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> certain<00:04:18.549> positions<00:04:18.910> that

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
rotate it into a certain positions that

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.159 
rotate it into a certain positions that
you<00:04:19.060> need<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.390> have<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.079> in<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:21.130> there<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.370> that

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
you need to have it in so there is that

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.010 
you need to have it in so there is that
swivel<00:04:23.169> band<00:04:23.830> at<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.100> knee<00:04:24.390> just<00:04:25.390> about<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.660> 90

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.490 
it and you can't pick it in i don't know
that's<00:05:58.060> not<00:05:58.180> really<00:05:58.240> useful<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:59.169> me<00:05:59.289> at<00:05:59.409> least

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
that's not really useful to me at least

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.279 
that's not really useful to me at least
again<00:06:00.250> I<00:06:00.370> maybe<00:06:00.520> just<00:06:00.789> not<00:06:01.509> thinking<00:06:01.870> of<00:06:02.020> the

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
again I maybe just not thinking of the

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:03.779 
again I maybe just not thinking of the
correct<00:06:02.680> way<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.830> get<00:06:03.129> this<00:06:03.220> figure<00:06:03.490> to<00:06:03.610> hold

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
correct way to get this figure to hold

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.790 
correct way to get this figure to hold
it<00:06:03.909> but<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.270> think<00:06:05.020> I'm<00:06:05.500> going<00:06:05.590> to<00:06:05.650> have<00:06:05.740> to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
it but I think I'm going to have to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.770 
it but I think I'm going to have to
shave<00:06:06.039> off<00:06:06.220> this<00:06:06.759> plastic<00:06:07.000> here<00:06:07.419> in<00:06:07.569> order<00:06:07.720> to

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
shave off this plastic here in order to

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.550 
shave off this plastic here in order to
get<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:09.449> hands<00:06:10.449> for<00:06:10.780> the<00:06:10.870> fingers<00:06:11.199> around

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
get the the hands for the fingers around

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.059 
get the the hands for the fingers around
the<00:06:11.740> grip<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:13.479> all<00:06:14.110> in<00:06:14.379> all<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.680> pretty<00:06:14.740> nice

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
the grip so all in all a pretty nice

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.529 
the grip so all in all a pretty nice
figure<00:06:15.340> but<00:06:15.490> like<00:06:15.819> I<00:06:15.849> say<00:06:16.060> it<00:06:16.180> does<00:06:16.330> suffer

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
figure but like I say it does suffer

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.110 
figure but like I say it does suffer
from<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:16.960> usual<00:06:17.139> but<00:06:17.560> farland<00:06:17.949> issues<00:06:18.849> of
