00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.050
 Nde have also changed teams twice in the other fourth year a miracle this time 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.289

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.770
 Speaking of strong points 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.770
 I use it as a weapon 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.990
 My own issue 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.460
 It was not said that I set this after 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.810
 In fact to say this Ise from their 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.130
 I transferred 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.130
 It is already three years collection 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:07.150
 There is a feeling that I want to go out to the game soon and get the result 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.830
 See how they work on the forearm stage together 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.500
 I was sorry for myself 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.530
 Something to look at it 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.890
 I also had to translate myself saying that I can not be an employee 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.850

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.180
 Hmm 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.180

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.180
 From 5 practice 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.170
 Hearing the word to make it compete 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.170
 My present 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.810
 I wonder if I'm going to the environment 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:46.570
 I had let me decide to come to sit in much Osaka or rather thanks to the parent 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.900
 Even when I go to Kumamoto, my parents are in favor of the second half finances 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.930

 It means now of my motivation following the other 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.340
 It feels like I want my parents to have a good dream 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.510
 I have that feeling all the time 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.450
 Komae N in so much of so much football against me with my parents 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.709
