00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
damn good it's been on the machine it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.099 
damn good it's been on the machine it
spun<00:00:24.720> fifty<00:00:25.080> times<00:00:25.289> each<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.820> spins

spun fifty times each way and it spins

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.110 
spun fifty times each way and it spins
fairly<00:00:28.109> hard<00:00:29.029> but<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.210> bad<00:00:30.800> okay<00:00:31.850> it's<00:00:32.850> hard

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
fairly hard but not bad okay it's hard

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840 
fairly hard but not bad okay it's hard
to<00:00:33.329> explain<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:33.719> hard<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.410> turn<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.579> we're<00:00:35.730> at

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
to explain how hard to turn but we're at

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.450 
to explain how hard to turn but we're at
50<00:00:36.390> right<00:00:36.870> now<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.350> basically<00:00:37.559> by<00:00:38.040> putting<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
50 right now and basically by putting it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
50 right now and basically by putting it
in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> machine<00:00:39.260> what<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> does<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
in the machine what it does is it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
in the machine what it does is it
nachshoni<00:00:41.579> any<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.540> high<00:00:42.719> spots<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
nachshoni any little high spots on the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.310 
nachshoni any little high spots on the
clutches<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:44.040> rid<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> some<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> coating

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
clutches get rid of some of that coating

settles<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> clutches<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.660> helps<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
settles in the clutches and helps to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.299 
settles in the clutches and helps to
settle<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> spiders<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:49.980> a

fairly easily but not you know you just
can't<00:00:58.530> spin<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> freely<00:00:59.399> okay<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:00.510> we're

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
can't spin it freely okay now we're

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
can't spin it freely okay now we're
going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> show<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.020> we're<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.250> up

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
close you get that's too damn tight if

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
close you get that's too damn tight if
you<00:02:13.830> put<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.100> together<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.840> that's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you put it together like that that's

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.430 
you put it together like that that's
okay<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.320> you're<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.680> drag<00:02:17.190> race<00:02:17.550> only<00:02:18.150> or

will be one unhappy camper so it just

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.190 
will be one unhappy camper so it just
shows<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.860> when<00:02:29.250> you're<00:02:29.430> tuning<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.930> two

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
shows you when you're tuning it what two

so<00:05:34.150> one<00:05:34.389> side<00:05:34.630> we<00:05:34.960> have<00:05:35.139> at<00:05:35.350> 126<00:05:43.830> let's<00:05:44.830> try<00:05:45.100> 120

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
so one side we have at 126 let's try 120

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.130 
so one side we have at 126 let's try 120
over<00:05:46.419> here<00:05:46.840> through<00:05:47.139> okay<00:05:48.810> go<00:05:49.810> all<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.080> way

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
over here through okay go all the way

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:57.720 
over here through okay go all the way
through<00:05:52.290> okay<00:05:53.290> here<00:05:53.500> nuttin<00:05:56.100> okay<00:05:57.100> I<00:05:57.310> fell

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
through okay here nuttin okay I fell

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.670 
through okay here nuttin okay I fell
each<00:05:58.000> site<00:05:59.640> that<00:06:00.640> lets<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.300> when<00:06:02.260> this<00:06:02.440> thing

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
each site that lets you when this thing

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.110 
each site that lets you when this thing
gets<00:06:02.890> run<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.310> you<00:06:03.370> go<00:06:03.490> around<00:06:03.580> curves<00:06:03.940> and

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
gets run and you go around curves and

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.730 
gets run and you go around curves and
corners<00:06:04.270> of<00:06:04.600> course<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:05.020> clutches<00:06:05.410> are<00:06:05.530> going

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
corners of course the clutches are going

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.680 
corners of course the clutches are going
to<00:06:05.860> expand<00:06:06.190> a<00:06:06.280> little<00:06:06.460> bit<00:06:06.580> so<00:06:07.240> that<00:06:07.270> allows

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
to expand a little bit so that allows

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.100 
to expand a little bit so that allows
the<00:06:07.990> clutch<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.410> expand<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.690> with<00:06:10.690> without

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
the clutch to expand and with without

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.110 
the clutch to expand and with without
having<00:06:11.470> n<00:06:11.590> play<00:06:11.800> on<00:06:11.979> the<00:06:12.100> axle<00:06:12.490> that<00:06:12.610> means<00:06:12.820> if

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
having n play on the axle that means if

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.000 
having n play on the axle that means if
the<00:06:13.240> clutch<00:06:13.510> expands<00:06:13.990> you<00:06:14.169> have<00:06:14.350> no<00:06:14.560> end<00:06:14.770> plate

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
the clutch expands you have no end plate

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.219 
the clutch expands you have no end plate
that<00:06:15.190> means<00:06:15.250> that<00:06:15.610> right<00:06:16.450> now<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.750> clutches

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
that means that right now the clutches

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.510 
that means that right now the clutches
are<00:06:17.290> going<00:06:17.410> to<00:06:17.470> be<00:06:17.560> in<00:06:17.650> a<00:06:17.710> bind<00:06:17.919> because<00:06:18.130> the

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
are going to be in a bind because the

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.740 
are going to be in a bind because the
c-clip<00:06:18.880> is<00:06:19.030> actually<00:06:19.330> going<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.510> be<00:06:19.570> pushing

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
c-clip is actually going to be pushing

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.510 
c-clip is actually going to be pushing
on<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:19.990> side<00:06:20.169> gear<00:06:20.470> clutches<00:06:21.250> are<00:06:21.340> going<00:06:21.460> to

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
on the side gear clutches are going to

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.730 
on the side gear clutches are going to
try<00:06:21.669> expand<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:23.080> as<00:06:23.229> long<00:06:23.350> as<00:06:23.410> you<00:06:23.560> have<00:06:23.710> a

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
try expand so as long as you have a

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.400 
try expand so as long as you have a
little<00:06:23.890> MP<00:06:24.280> then<00:06:24.880> you're<00:06:25.600> fine<00:06:25.840> because<00:06:26.080> that

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
little MP then you're fine because that

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.970 
little MP then you're fine because that
allow<00:06:26.740> to<00:06:26.800> expand<00:06:27.340> that<00:06:27.490> fifo
