00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.889
 all good mood with you i 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.480
 Anthony today would like to show you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.210
 my new construction my project 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.800
 who called anthony tapes and what is it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
 for my new building 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.650
 this is my new school in minecraft yes 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.380
 It is a school because I do not know how I 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.210
 read the comments and even somehow myself 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.210
 so I decided to build a school today 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.520
 because school don't know more near 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 close to exactly close to me because i 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.410
 he himself is still a schoolboy here and decided 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 somehow build a school at all school 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 turned out really enough 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.899
 great meaning it turned out more 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 than for example my supermarket and somewhere 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 about the same size yet 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.539
 model nude in width anyway 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.480
 here and here actually as she looks 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.070
 here I built a stone inscription 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.719
 type of school but in English like she 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.359
 something like that, I'm surely spelled 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.239
 sure that's actually built in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.400
 mainly of stone and brick because 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 somehow I don't know school she usually seems to be 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.630
 so and somehow it does not look like a tree 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.000
 here somehow to involve I thought that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.970
 not worth it and decided to build here as something 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.680
 so well let's go to school 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.240
 imagine that we are schoolchildren again and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 go and maybe not even 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.530
 Imagine because some may even 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 be also school students here and go shorter 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 to the school itself what we meet here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.590
 the very beginning upon entering this school 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.479
 such here are small fountains but they 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.579
 very small but you can 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.530
 sit for a rest i have it for example 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.610
 here's a change and you want to go out for a breath 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.680
 fresh air 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.320
 come out here or you go and next to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.479
 park and can rest here well then 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.299
 we enter our school and actually what we 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.399
 see here we have stairs next 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.500
 the fact that there are two stairs leading to 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.600
 the second floor and here we have to sit 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.049
 type of watchman that is a man who 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.759
 looking for those who came there looking 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.600
 for things here we have this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.700
 dressing room with our wooden fence like 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.409
 whatever it may sound funny here and in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 Generally here you can hang your 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.280
 some outerwear 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.009
 a gaga jacket here and here 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.810
 go to your classes so what 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.550
 perhaps we will close the door and now 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.319
 we actually on the ground floor what 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.560
 we have on the first floor first it 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.819
 we have a gym I built here 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.100
 Of course the gym is also not a little 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.140
 standard wooden look 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.390
 fence again wooden fence is it 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.700
 us like a ring something that is like in 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.200
 basketball ring here I am now, too 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.810
 very often basketball and r 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 fond of how I built it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 such rings here even two rings at once 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.000
 built because somehow one here 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.340
 it would be ugly that is you now 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.660
 you can throw two at once all not even 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.730
 will present how it will look 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.000
 Well, you never know, here also I 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.060
 divided the whole area ie the whole field 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.780
 the whole area yes I divided into zones like 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.549
 in principle, here's my gym for example 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.330
 my school has a center here 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.290
 there is some kind of I don't know the type 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.430
 three points with which you can 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.319
 throw but this is anyway in 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.540
 basketball as well and here it is the same 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.400
 most here and here on the sides 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.070
 small rings if for example you 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.510
 very little and you play basketball too 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.609
 and maybe not even the same 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.070
 basketball, that is, for example, but in any 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.290
 different games are playing here the gym 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.650
 there are a few rings here 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.540
 rings say here we have this 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 a small dressing room and actually where 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.940
 you can also undress here hang 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.160
 I donâ€™t know my stuff there 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.200
 put some of my clothes to sit in 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.269
 in general, the dressing room is small enough 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.260
 if for example there are ten people or 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.570
 well, or there 15 I think more will come but if 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.730
 more then of course not but here 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.890
 actually go to the next room 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 we have here yet on the first floor this 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.810
 our dining room is our dining room 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.930
 because the dining room is probably the most 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.170
 not 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.150
 as a heavenly place for a student here 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.189
 here we have a lot more 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.530
 place here you can sit 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.299
 also relax take a look at nature 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.719
 The nature here is very good. 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.150
 that's actually here that's how u on 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.069
 the school canteen is the canteen itself where 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.109
 all main food is actually prepared 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.989
 for schoolchildren, that is, it is with us 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.139
 a table where food is prepared here 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.240
 highly sorts of stoves have any 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.970
 chests are like a refrigerator 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.729
 us and here we will have this 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.099
 here are the vaults food storage vaults 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.800
 stocks just food our catering 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:35.169
 school here and here you can here here 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.750
 at least go to take food and proper 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.720
 have already prepared our students 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.120
 our schoolmates damn how is it cool 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.520
 that's well, and here you are 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.430
 have eaten everything and you should already 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.320
 go to class all rooms 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.690
 is on the second floor of everything here 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.460
 by the way two floors but I decided everything 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.770
 build two floors and me basically how 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.409
 then I thought enough is enough 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.360
 there are so many different rooms here i am probably 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.500
 I'll hang the signs more or less so 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.080
 distribute what 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.240
 by classes as they are called there numbers 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.770
 at least hang some here with us 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.800
 you can sit on a sofa to rest 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.760
 there is also a sofa there and I think there 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.880
 there is a sofa too 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.880
 that's actually all the rooms in principle 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.280
 i like them very much 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.159
 a little bit like in america that is there if 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.199
 you remember there it is not like a desk such 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.349
 big for two people and that's it 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.419
 as small as his seat right away 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.150
 the table is small but we own it 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:37.479
 board is our green favorite board 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.699
 Immediately straight nostalgia and sobsno you 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.710
 let's say here the teacher is writing here and you 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.490
 take notes out material or just 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.740
 listen to him 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.960
 that's actually all in principle halls and 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.539
 halls office and in principle the rank itself 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.849
 i seem to have tried to build ports like 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:54.009
 can be closer to the window so that he knows 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.080
 when for example you can do nothing like that 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.360
 sit look on the street going on 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.389
 mine is very cool and i'm so strong 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.189
 I also do it like this 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.330
 showed the same room here with us 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.309
 such a room 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.289
 board here we have a little bit smaller and 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.209
 actually basically as I said 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.219
 here everything is very similar, well, this school 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:15.159
 the school here is an office and almost the same 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:18.789
 here's how the whole thing looks like this 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:20.709
 let's go to the next room so 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.479
 we have a board here too 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:24.939
 here it is convenient by the way because 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.740
 previous boards did not close the window 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.110
 it was not very convenient here 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.419
 just a simple brick that's how you would 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.419
 brick hanged 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.809
 like this room we went to the little room 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.759
 our 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.499
 and that we have here here we have an office and 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:40.929
 which are extremely located a little bit 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.849
 more than here such are their office 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.800
 a little bit smaller here by the way 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.360
 This review is also quite good 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.569
 here you can see who is on the street there 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.029
 for example sits skirting here and just 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.729
 so look at nature is very fun 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:56.949
 by the way so well and actually here the same 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.899
 most, in principle, you can see what 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.069
 going on there on the street is also very 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.499
 conveniently let's say 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.959
 Well, how in the city because here if you 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:07.149
 for example, want to eat something there 

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:09.219
 have a bite you can come down and 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:11.559
 his immediately to the supermarket in my opinion too 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:12.930
 very convenient to actually go down 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:15.639
 same ladder 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.800
 go take your jacket for example 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:20.469
 if you have it well for example top 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.619
 what clothes and close the door and 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:25.149
 leave school happy here 

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:28.240
 actually how again our school 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:30.669
 in general it looks very similar to 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.619
 previous buildings but the appearance 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.420
 slightly different because it is made from 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.460
 stone as i repeat 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.280
 and of course placed here such 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.410
 character but that's all with you was me 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.620
 anthony put likes subscribe to 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.780
 channel wait for the next video and on this 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.120
 sad and maybe even fun 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:53.040
 note i finish my video wanna wish 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.040
 you good luck and success in life
