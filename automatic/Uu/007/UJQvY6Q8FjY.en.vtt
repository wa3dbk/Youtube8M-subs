to come back to this video in a second
we<00:01:01.380> could<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.770> sometime

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.220 

we've<00:01:09.350> reached<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.710> bit<00:01:09.829> of<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.979> stalemate

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
we've reached a bit of a stalemate

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.830 
we've reached a bit of a stalemate
she's<00:01:11.680> been<00:01:11.800> on<00:01:11.890> for<00:01:12.070> about<00:01:12.100> certain<00:01:12.550> minutes

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
she's been on for about certain minutes

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.200 
she's been on for about certain minutes
and<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.520> lot<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.760> tension<00:01:15.970> on<00:01:16.180> that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
and there's a lot of tension on that

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
and there's a lot of tension on that
Lauren<00:01:16.660> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.660> either<00:01:22.810> tie<00:01:23.080> over<00:01:23.260> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:44.700 

pound<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.190> pressure<00:01:33.400> there<00:01:43.410> my<00:01:44.410> fish<00:01:44.590> was

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
pound bit of pressure there my fish was

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.290 
pound bit of pressure there my fish was
tangled<00:01:44.980> up<00:01:45.220> which<00:01:45.370> just<00:01:45.490> untangle<00:01:45.970> itself

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
tangled up which just untangle itself

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.440 
tangled up which just untangle itself
and<00:01:46.660> took<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.810> bit<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.020> lowering<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.560> right

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and took a bit of lowering of it right

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.780 
and took a bit of lowering of it right
hopefully<00:01:49.450> if<00:01:50.080> tape<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:51.520> what<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.760> should

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
hopefully if tape that's what it should

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.170 
hopefully if tape that's what it should
they<00:01:52.090> should<00:01:52.540> swim<00:01:52.810> up<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:52.960> toys<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:55.060> we

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
they should swim up the toys and we

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.370
