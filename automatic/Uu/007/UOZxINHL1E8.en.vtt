it<00:00:54.430> from<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.579> vehicle<00:00:54.910> but<00:00:55.510> really<00:00:55.719> all<00:00:55.750> we

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
it from the vehicle but really all we

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.150 
it from the vehicle but really all we
need<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.140> do<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.440> hit<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.800> top<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.010> the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
strut and actually leaving a connect it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.090 
strut and actually leaving a connect it
makes<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.199> a<00:00:59.260> little<00:00:59.379> bit<00:00:59.559> easier<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.980> hold
