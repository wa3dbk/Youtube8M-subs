chose<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.610> that's<00:01:54.789> why<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.000> thought<00:01:55.179> it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
chose this and that's why I thought it

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.429

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.020 
have to do that for the other four
battles<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:27.010> were<00:02:27.130> able<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.459> heal<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:27.940> in

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
battles you were able to heal right in

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.479 
battles you were able to heal right in
front<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.329> person<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.840> invite<00:02:29.200> them<00:02:29.489> but

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
front of a person that invite them but

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.309 
front of a person that invite them but
so<00:02:30.700> here<00:02:30.970> most<00:02:31.209> people<00:02:31.510> probably<00:02:31.690> walked<00:02:32.109> in

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
so here most people probably walked in

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.690 
so here most people probably walked in
the<00:02:32.410> room<00:02:32.530> expecting<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.220> heel<00:02:33.430> right<00:02:33.609> in

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the room expecting the heel right in

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.479 
the room expecting the heel right in
front<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:33.970> them<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.180> fight<00:02:34.540> them<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:36.190> can

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
front of them and fight them but you can

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.430 
front of them and fight them but you can
because<00:02:37.299> it<00:02:37.720> makes<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.109> find<00:02:38.349> them

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
because it makes you find them

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.289 
because it makes you find them
automatically<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.310> most<00:02:39.579> people<00:02:39.760> probably

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
automatically so most people probably

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.570 
automatically so most people probably
had

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
had

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.200 
had
um<00:02:42.110> Pokemon<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.260> were<00:02:43.380> injured<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.210> someone

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
um Pokemon that were injured and someone

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.300 
um Pokemon that were injured and someone
that<00:02:45.390> were<00:02:45.570> probably<00:02:45.930> fainted<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.800> most<00:02:47.010> had

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that were probably fainted and most had

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.500 
that were probably fainted and most had
very<00:02:47.820> low<00:02:48.120> um<00:02:49.040> p<00:02:50.040> p4<00:02:51.170> moves<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.820> that's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
very low um p p4 moves and so that's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.900 
very low um p p4 moves and so that's
that's<00:02:55.200> basically<00:02:55.860> all<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.400> reasons<00:02:56.730> what

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
that's basically all the reasons what

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.320 
that's basically all the reasons what
he's<00:02:57.270> hard<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.470> why<00:02:58.680> he's<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.520> top<00:02:59.820> pen<00:03:01.280> so

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
he's hard and why he's on the top pen so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.870 
he's hard and why he's on the top pen so
just<00:03:03.330> sit<00:03:03.930> back<00:03:04.110> relax<00:03:04.440> watch<00:03:05.220> me<00:03:05.460> beat<00:03:05.700> this
