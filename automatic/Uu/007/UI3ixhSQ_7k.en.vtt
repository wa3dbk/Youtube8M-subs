00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.040
 hi to all and crisis in lyon today 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.050
 we will try a new fact and this 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.480
 this time it will be a high class fact 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.980
 and the class it will be for our friends the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.369
 demon hunters 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.770
 so good they are not difficult on 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.020
 some but there is one that deserved 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.570
 maybe a little video and he 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.269
 is not titrated and you have to trap 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.920
 a boss for 40 seconds in a row in 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.750
 using trap gears 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.420
 so I've already done them but I'm going 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.629
 show you the little tip that I have 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.970
 used to do it then for that 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.650
 we will load a game in mode 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.460
 normal and in act iii and here we go 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.820
 take 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.879
 you so the lake is number 3 a breach 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 to the dungeon and you are eraser exactly eh 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.570
 yes so it's safe eraser that we're going 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.100
 perform this high then done in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.259
 your bar of what he then everything 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 just so we are in normal mode there 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.170
 do not kill like so already the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.659
 companion we turn it second detail 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 in the staff inventory thorn that we get 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 rids 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.820
 I repeat the staff thorn it's 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.399
 what makes the damage 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.610
 when we touch you impeccable I am 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.160
 to 0 last thing it's our friend the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.039
 shoe trap and it is not necessary that he 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.690
 do damage so to be able to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.850
 spam and we'll say regularly we're going 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.500
 use art a cult piece and who 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.600
 reduces the cost of the four- point trap 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.700
 of discipline knowing that I have 30 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 you may have 40 suddenly it goes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 to be really really easy so we're going 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.649
 take that and we'll take it too 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.320
 preparation with the street mind focus 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.590
 that will give you 45 points of discipline 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.140
 so 30 for my part to me but 45 is going 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.380
 maybe if i use so that should 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.540
 suffice crying then that we will 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.720
 teleport to the depths of the dungeon 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.570
 level 3 and we're just going 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.060
 go back into the pantry not 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.230
 to be eaten but to fuck 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 our friend eraser 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.489
 so I'll let you watch 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.620
 the time on the video 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.120
 I will try to put a time I 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.410
 I'll take it right away 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.310
 that it speaks 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.750
 hop hop 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.900
 I'm on my cell phone I 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.220
 I'll put a little timer here go 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.840
 as soon as I put the first shoe 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.940
 trapes we left so be careful 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.319
 not to type it here so I put a 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.290
 it traps it lasts six seconds 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.300
 counted up to 5 and you launched a two 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.170
 three four five and we restart 1 2 3 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.620
 4 5 en enrolling st there i am at 12 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.560
 seconds 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.239
 hop we're going to launch one you've seen my 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.760
 discipline anyway I can even 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 spa but then I'm 20 seconds from 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.390
 video to two duos videos do go 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.390
 we continue to swoon so you see 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.220
 trapped it does not mean instant a 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.959
 lute the trap lasts six seconds 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.569
 it really needs that during these six 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.420
 seconds they simply suffer 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.610
 the damage so here we continue I 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.920
 am finally at 40 seconds so 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.290
 normally at this point you should 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.569
 to have the feat that are worth it right here 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.160
 and ben I hope you'll get there 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.440
 you have seen prevent all my 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.660
 discipline i can in addition swing my 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
 preparation to recover and I can 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.459
 spammer non-stop like that finally y'a 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.690
 really no trouble to go I 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.959
