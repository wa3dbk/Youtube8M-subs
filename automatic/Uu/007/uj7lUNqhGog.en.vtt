00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
sleep blog where it can detect how much

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.999

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
sleep or not and it can also vibrate

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
exactly each day is not super specific

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.420 
exactly each day is not super specific
but<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.080> an<00:03:04.290> interesting<00:03:04.440> insight<00:03:05.099> into

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
but it is an interesting insight into

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.160 
but it is an interesting insight into
how<00:03:05.760> your<00:03:05.910> weeks<00:03:06.150> been<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.750> were<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> look

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
back on it after a weeks use but back to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.900 
back on it after a weeks use but back to
the<00:03:10.380> sleep<00:03:10.680> tracking<00:03:10.860> system<00:03:11.519> within<00:03:11.790> this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the sleep tracking system within this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360 
the sleep tracking system within this
band<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.390> found<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.140> interesting<00:03:13.370> so

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
band I found this really interesting so

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.360 
band I found this really interesting so
it<00:03:14.819> basically<00:03:15.420> shows<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:16.620> many<00:03:17.130> hours

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
it basically shows you how many hours

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.030 
it basically shows you how many hours
you've<00:03:17.640> slept<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.329> slept<00:03:18.570> deeply<00:03:19.500> or

felt really drained and tired still I
checked<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.150> app<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.660> said<00:03:27.959> well<00:03:28.260> you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
checked the app and it said well you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.680 
checked the app and it said well you
only<00:03:28.650> slept<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.010> six<00:03:29.220> hours<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.450> didn't

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
only slept for six hours and you didn't

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.330 
only slept for six hours and you didn't
have<00:03:30.810> much<00:03:30.959> deep<00:03:31.230> sleep<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:32.100> really

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
have much deep sleep and it really

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.069 
have much deep sleep and it really
correspondent<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.120> way<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.329> felt<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
correspondent to the way I felt and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.349 
correspondent to the way I felt and
other<00:03:34.290> days<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.709> felt<00:03:34.890> really<00:03:35.100> refreshed<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.910> had

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
other days I felt really refreshed I had

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.360 
other days I felt really refreshed I had
more<00:03:36.569> hours<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.930> sleep<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.410> more<00:03:37.799> deep<00:03:38.100> sleep

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
more hours of sleep and more deep sleep

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.099 
more hours of sleep and more deep sleep
which<00:03:38.609> is<00:03:38.760> really<00:03:39.000> interesting<00:03:39.150> mind<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.959> the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
which is really interesting mind you the

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.160 
which is really interesting mind you the
band<00:03:40.319> only<00:03:40.560> works<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.549> movement<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:43.049> you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
band only works on the movement that you

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.660 
band only works on the movement that you
do<00:03:43.350> when<00:03:43.560> you're<00:03:43.680> sleeping<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.340> that's<00:03:44.459> how

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
do when you're sleeping and that's how

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.599 
do when you're sleeping and that's how
it<00:03:44.819> apparently<00:03:45.420> forms<00:03:45.810> these<00:03:46.370> ideas<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.489> you

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
it apparently forms these ideas that you

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.300 
it apparently forms these ideas that you
had<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.819> deep<00:03:48.060> sleep<00:03:48.299> or<00:03:48.480> not<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.799> found<00:03:50.160> it

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
had a deep sleep or not but I found it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.059 
had a deep sleep or not but I found it
to<00:03:50.519> sort<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.000> correspond<00:03:51.450> correctly<00:03:51.989> most<00:03:52.829> the

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
to sort of correspond correctly most the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.800 
to sort of correspond correctly most the
time<00:03:53.280> which<00:03:53.609> is<00:03:53.790> kind<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.209> fun<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.600> see

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
time which is kind of just fun to see

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.470 
time which is kind of just fun to see
and<00:03:55.190> also<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.549> set<00:03:56.819> an<00:03:56.910> alarm<00:03:57.120> on<00:03:57.299> this

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and also you can set an alarm on this

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.030 
and also you can set an alarm on this
thing<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.840> wake<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.260> up

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
thing to wake you up

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.370 
thing to wake you up
within<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> thirty<00:03:59.819> minute<00:04:00.030> time<00:04:00.420> period<00:04:00.450> when

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
within a thirty minute time period when

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.430 
within a thirty minute time period when
you're<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:02.010> lighter<00:04:02.639> stage<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.690> sleep<00:04:03.900> so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
you're in a lighter stage of sleep so

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.340 
you're in a lighter stage of sleep so
you've<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:05.609> did<00:04:05.910> work<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.180> me<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> few<00:04:06.750> times<00:04:06.930> it

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
you've it did work for me a few times it

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.229 
you've it did work for me a few times it
would<00:04:07.530> vibrate<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.730> wake<00:04:09.030> me<00:04:09.209> up

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
would vibrate and wake me up

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.379 
would vibrate and wake me up
successfully<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.620> felt<00:04:10.950> pretty<00:04:11.700> okay<00:04:12.359> with

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
successfully and I felt pretty okay with

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.750 
successfully and I felt pretty okay with
waking<00:04:13.019> up<00:04:13.170> at<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.590> time<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.130> guess<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.609> was

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
waking up at that time so I guess I was

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.029 
waking up at that time so I guess I was
sleeping<00:04:15.209> more<00:04:15.900> lightly<00:04:16.169> not<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.829> deep

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
sleeping more lightly not in a deep

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.759 
sleeping more lightly not in a deep
sleep<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:18.389> felt<00:04:18.600> better<00:04:18.750> than<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.169> would<00:04:19.440> if

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
sleep and I felt better than I would if

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.250 
sleep and I felt better than I would if
LARM<00:04:20.700> was<00:04:20.910> going<00:04:21.209> off<00:04:21.419> at<00:04:21.599> me<00:04:21.720> in<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> morning

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
LARM was going off at me in the morning

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.899 
LARM was going off at me in the morning
to<00:04:22.380> wake<00:04:22.530> me<00:04:22.710> up<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.070> that's<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.550> really<00:04:23.760> cool

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
to wake me up so that's a really cool

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.390 
to wake me up so that's a really cool
feature<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.570> regards<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.409> design<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
feature it regards to the design of the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.950 
feature it regards to the design of the
and<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.669> think<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.940> looks<00:04:27.060> pretty<00:04:27.270> cool<00:04:27.449> and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and I think it looks pretty cool and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.570 
and I think it looks pretty cool and
it's<00:04:28.380> actually<00:04:28.680> really<00:04:28.830> comfortable<00:04:29.460> I

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
it's actually really comfortable I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.450 
it's actually really comfortable I
haven't<00:04:30.060> had<00:04:30.540> problem<00:04:30.990> wearing<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.590> on<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
haven't had problem wearing it on the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.400 
haven't had problem wearing it on the
inside<00:04:32.850> it's<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.150> soft<00:04:33.479> rubber<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.259> on<00:04:34.350> the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
inside it's a soft rubber and on the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.320 
inside it's a soft rubber and on the
outside<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.070> more<00:04:35.220> textured<00:04:35.820> rubber<00:04:36.180> I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
outside it's a more textured rubber I

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.240 
outside it's a more textured rubber I
guess<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:36.870> for<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.320> look<00:04:37.530> though<00:04:38.039> I<00:04:38.070> did

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
guess just for the look though I did

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.070 
guess just for the look though I did
find<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.699> texture<00:04:39.180> on<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.479> outside<00:04:39.900> of

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
find that the texture on the outside of

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.189 
find that the texture on the outside of
the<00:04:40.169> band<00:04:40.380> tends<00:04:41.009> to<00:04:41.220> pick<00:04:41.370> up<00:04:41.520> dust<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.199> fluff

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
the band tends to pick up dust and fluff

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.870 
the band tends to pick up dust and fluff
which<00:04:43.889> is<00:04:44.039> not<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.340> great

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
which is not that great

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.270 
which is not that great
however<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.780> wristband<00:04:46.169> is<00:04:46.320> waterproof<00:04:46.949> so

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
however the wristband is waterproof so

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.129 
however the wristband is waterproof so
you<00:04:47.310> can<00:04:47.520> simply<00:04:48.120> wash<00:04:48.389> it<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.810> also<00:04:48.960> you

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
you can simply wash it and also you

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.810 
you can simply wash it and also you
never<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.830> take<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.160> off

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
never have to take it off

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.969 
never have to take it off
basically<00:04:51.419> because<00:04:51.750> yeah<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.680> you're<00:04:52.800> having

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
basically because yeah if you're having

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.830 
basically because yeah if you're having
a<00:04:53.039> shower<00:04:53.250> doesn't<00:04:53.759> matter<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.330> band<00:04:54.509> itself

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
a shower doesn't matter the band itself

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.480 
a shower doesn't matter the band itself
looks<00:04:55.169> pretty<00:04:55.440> simple<00:04:55.949> there's<00:04:56.250> not<00:04:56.370> much

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
looks pretty simple there's not much

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.430 
looks pretty simple there's not much
going<00:04:56.699> on<00:04:56.940> there's<00:04:57.240> no<00:04:57.360> display<00:04:57.900> there's<00:04:58.259> just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
going on there's no display there's just

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.770 
going on there's no display there's just
one<00:04:58.650> button<00:04:58.949> on<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.160> side<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.760> some<00:05:00.180> LEDs

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
one button on the side and some LEDs

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.390 
one button on the side and some LEDs
which<00:05:01.080> let<00:05:01.289> you<00:05:01.410> know<00:05:01.530> whether<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.949> band's<00:05:02.160> in

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
which let you know whether the band's in

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
connected to my phone but you can simply

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
to your phone I just don't think it

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.460 
to your phone I just don't think it
gives<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.460> your<00:05:32.699> stats<00:05:33.030> in<00:05:33.300> real<00:05:33.479> time<00:05:33.780> but<00:05:34.349> it

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
gives you your stats in real time but it

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.770 
gives you your stats in real time but it
will<00:05:34.560> update<00:05:35.010> whenever<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:36.240> band<00:05:36.449> is<00:05:36.599> then

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780

reconnected<00:05:37.410> overall<00:05:37.949> I<00:05:37.979> really<00:05:38.280> like<00:05:38.580> the

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
reconnected overall I really like the

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.040 
reconnected overall I really like the
Sony<00:05:38.910> smart<00:05:39.210> band<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.630> think<00:05:39.840> it's<00:05:39.960> a

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
Sony smart band and I think it's a

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.080 
Sony smart band and I think it's a
pretty<00:05:40.260> good<00:05:40.470> deal<00:05:40.680> for<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:41.010> price<00:05:41.310> if<00:05:41.669> you

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
pretty good deal for the price if you

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.580 
pretty good deal for the price if you
are<00:05:42.270> interested<00:05:42.810> in<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:42.990> fitness<00:05:43.409> tracker

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
are interested in the fitness tracker

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.500 
are interested in the fitness tracker
this<00:05:44.099> will<00:05:44.280> certainly<00:05:44.580> do<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.000> job<00:05:45.240> it's<00:05:45.419> very

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
this will certainly do the job it's very

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.740 
this will certainly do the job it's very
similar<00:05:46.110> to<00:05:46.349> a<00:05:46.380> Fitbit<00:05:46.919> or<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.400> jawbone<00:05:48.000> up<00:05:48.300> but

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
similar to a Fitbit or a jawbone up but

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.360 
similar to a Fitbit or a jawbone up but
it<00:05:48.840> actually<00:05:48.960> does<00:05:49.289> just<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.740> little<00:05:49.979> bit<00:05:50.130> more

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
it actually does just a little bit more

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.920 
it actually does just a little bit more
than<00:05:50.550> that<00:05:50.699> when<00:05:50.880> it's<00:05:51.000> tracking<00:05:51.389> your<00:05:51.479> social

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
than that when it's tracking your social

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.409 
than that when it's tracking your social
stuff<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.530> everything<00:05:53.280> I<00:05:53.520> talked<00:05:53.789> about<00:05:53.909> I

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
stuff and everything I talked about I

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.029 
stuff and everything I talked about I
would<00:05:54.720> probably<00:05:55.050> recommend<00:05:55.349> using<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.860> with<00:05:56.010> a

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
would probably recommend using it with a

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:57.770 
would probably recommend using it with a
Sony<00:05:56.280> phone<00:05:56.610> if<00:05:56.760> possible<00:05:57.210> but<00:05:57.419> at<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.659> same

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
Sony phone if possible but at the same

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.230 
Sony phone if possible but at the same
time<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.409> doesn't<00:05:58.830> matter<00:05:58.979> too<00:05:59.250> much<00:05:59.280> I've<00:05:59.729> had

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
time it doesn't matter too much I've had

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.850 
time it doesn't matter too much I've had
not<00:06:00.510> really<00:06:00.750> any<00:06:00.870> issues<00:06:01.260> using<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:01.710> with<00:06:01.830> my

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
not really any issues using it with my

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.589 
not really any issues using it with my
