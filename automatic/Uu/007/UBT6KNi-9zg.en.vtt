00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 notifications is a very thing 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.629
 important in our mobile device 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.340
 you do not know about incoming messages and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.469
 lots of other things but the most 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.599
 curious is knowing how to customize them and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.099
 set the right ones so that everything is a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 like with your mobile device so that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.100
 notify has to with a sound 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.529
 suitable or that the screen appears 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.750
 I start with many things and that's why today 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 this video that explain how to set 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.170
 and customize the notifications of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 your windows phone so that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.949
 have to your taste this again of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.949
 windows by win phone cloud we started 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.329
 good we are in the positive be mobile 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.270
 of microsoft lumia 535 and we are going to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 customize notifications for 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.600
 we're going to all the configuration 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.440
 of our windows phone is worth and here 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 let's use two modes 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.670
 good two options the first option is 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.860
 notifications and actions is worth and here 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.210
 because as we can see we were sinking 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.280
 up here because this for the adjustments 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.159
 of the request or that we are not interested is for 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 the notifications here in another analyst 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.879
 worth of the applications that send us 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.970
 notifications for example whatsapp the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.149
 store ccoo post messages 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.130
 sim messages the email on instagram 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.750
 ok and we will get the expressions that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.600
 we use with notifications 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.570
 valech and here will give us for example what 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.800
 that in the case of gmail tm gmail the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.550
 heifer and vice options very 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.550
 Interesting 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.140
 the first one is to show messages 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.399
 emerging from the notification what do you want 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.590
 say this that when we are giving the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.539
 mobile and a notification arrived because 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 this gmail case above will appear 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.590
 then the typical message to press and the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.479
 email up here always leaves the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.369
 message is what I already knew what it is 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.990
 not here up then activate it will come out 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.369
 that message if we do not want a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
 message because it bothers us this 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.630
 application then from here we are going to 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.539
 deactivate vale 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.789
 then notification sound when we 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.380
 come this message or notify us or 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.119
 we have the option to put a sound 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.840
 customized for example we have the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.840
 typical mail windows and all 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.240
 these alerts and we have many more 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.579
 Even I have already explained that we can 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.470
 create shades worth leaving on a label 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.149
 over here to create a tone is worth and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.340
 We can put it customized with a 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.630
 song with like things like that then it's worth 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.910
 over here we have to make us 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.890
 also a vibration notification 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.390
 bad check for here we observe 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.430
 explains everything 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.580
 in another case for example in whatsapp 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.380
 it's exactly the same but put 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.180
 predetermined because because one's own 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.640
 whatsapp application has the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.709
 configuration to change the sounds of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.880
 the application so very important that 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.920
 I recommend with you will need a 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.540
 application and make notifications or you put 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.610
 those options to see if anything notifies 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 for example whatsapp has it to put 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.130
 other sound than the groups or 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.020
 people is worth that, on the one hand, it is worth and for 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.970
 another side we have apart from the 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.160
 notifications and actions we have the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.350
 Lock screen option 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.209
 I'm very 30 because people who do not know 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.090
 and it is very very important there is that there 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.620
 we put notifications okay here we have 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.420
 this photo notifications for 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.130
 comments and one we have to put it 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.900
 detailed here as you can see there is a 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.370
 list of applications it is worth that we can 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.980
 choose for detailed what does this mean 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.050
 for example with acquiring the battery is worth 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.670
 if now we pay the mobile and what 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.800
 we block here as we can see us 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.080
 puts two days since the last load is worth 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.670
 this is a basic notification 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.620
 as I leave there we can choose between 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.239
 many others like by email us 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.769
 will appear to be a put on my last 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.650
 in this case not because I do not have emails 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.810
 will show us the last mail 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.090
 and much more for example skype twitter 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.590
 whatsapp is I for example the ones with the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.299
 calendar because I find it interesting 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.069
 what the day tells us we have some 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.689
 scheduled event is worth I have 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.840
 vacation for the holidays 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.069
 It 's very interesting and it's worth 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.140
 if we want you can put it any 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.180
 annoying question and here below your 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.230
 unknowns are to put the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.840
 notifications that are on the screen 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.430
 home say here it's worth here for example 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.290
 that we have a 16 pool courses and that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.670
 it's a news reader it's worth it 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.019
 explain in the top 10 of the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.599
 essential applications worth 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.430
 teams add them in order as I can 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.190
 put here whatsapp here was by 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.650
 book to the breakthrough good here is yes 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.950
 rotten let's move in half poly vale 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.989
 medium here let's go let twitter go and 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.370
 this we are going to leave it for the battery 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.470
 OK 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.590
 the battery and here the mobile or without 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.650
 there is a vale 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.630
 and remember this order is worth whatsapp 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.699
 this I am this will vary when we pay and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.229
 we block here we get the 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.930
 notifications are in the order that I 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.090
 fit we have six of sixteen exist 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.280
 polio how to pronounce and the 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.449
 battery is worth this I remind you that very 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.970
 interesting since I kiss after 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.650
 applications that you do not click on 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.900
 Valencian so much and dimensiona application 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.220
 does not notify us on this list but 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.120
 not only the most interesting one that 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.610
 above because in this information 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.940
 detailed and between this configuration that 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.830
 we have done in oval lock screen 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.990
 and in notifications and actions for 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.820
 buy sounds and vibrations and 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.500
 all this I think we can 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.540
 get a pretty Cuban perception 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.590
 of notifications is also worth later 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.940
 if we want we can look for a 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.590
 application to download all 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.720
 custom I think we were not 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.040
 very good and it's very interesting and good 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.080
 so far this video that I hope you 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.880
