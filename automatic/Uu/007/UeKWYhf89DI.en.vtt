00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.380
 hey people and heart is coming back on the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.719
 channel of german top gameplays yes here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.699
 is the impax energy and around it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.050
 her a gameplay of the energy with 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.840
 the gallery max the python i believe 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 with faster as far as I know then 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.689
 he serves two vials aids a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 I know semtex and its perks now 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 unfortunately not or wait we know 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.870
 but yes exactly hotline pride of fans 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 pro and marathon and besides he has 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.820
 even the tactics got in there quite 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 important for such a gameplay dennis 1 207 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 to collect nine yes in black ops 1 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 really cool game 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 and that's why you should come with this 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.730
 of course today, that's the topic 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.980
 games or simply cod as it runs 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.660
 because we know all the backups know now 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.730
 you can get out of it for a long time 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 not really seeing so much anymore 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.010
 That's why I want that again 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.390
 Christian makes here with the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.229
 different gameplays from the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.400
 different cds and that's why 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.720
 I just wanted to talk to you about it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.850
 Talk like it for me at least for the moment 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.000
 looks like I have the time to goz 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 bridge I am still playing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.299
 I can honestly say black ops 2 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 I also like to play 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.520
 fun 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.960
 the whole is probably synonymous 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 because it's just my first 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.610
 theory is and yes I just because 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.549
 I'm in and that makes me 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.619
 just really much fun yes other cds 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.119
 otherwise I have mw2 that I play off 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.619
 and sometimes you can actually 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.640
 Almost no longer play on 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.990
 the ps3 because there are only hackers so 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.700
 even I played it so little and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.619
 I'm really just in hacker 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 lobbies that's really almost not clear 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.100
 and so I drop since my dear 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.780
 finger off and rather stay black ops 2 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 yes, as I said, I play 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.560
 currently the top 2 gets there as well 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.360
 still my time with rum or 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 I just enjoy playing it that way 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.689
 in the clear and in the team you know I am 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 a mclaren is always there 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.490
 correctly thought to play with the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.099
 People and so I always find very cool 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.660
 and yes that's the way you can do it 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.150
 many mirror time still play 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.510
 mw3 again for a while because black ops 2 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.150
 just do not like it 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.319
 Of course I could understand Mw3 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.090
 I actually get now, too 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.220
 but unfortunately still has 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.500
 not worked out right with me time 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.650
 get used because new buy for it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.239
 I think that's a bit no 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.409
 I do not know 30 euros now 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.879
 bock to spend more there 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.230
 That's why I prefer that much 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.090
 buy new then I have easy 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.799
 that if any 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.690
 second hand 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.040
 and yes, what's difficult at the moment 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.680
 i still play league of legends 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 on the pc just with a few buddies 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.060
 just a little bit 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.690
 to have a theory of change 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 so somehow with black ops 2 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.290
 sorry so only black ops 2 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.989
 it does not work and you need it 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.430
 Somehow it's a different game 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.420
 can also play otherwise I have from 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.489
 Four still heard that we currently 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.239
 just black ops 1 again right 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.250
 well and a lot of players should probably play a lot 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.629
 bad people have to be on the way 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.489
 I heard it so I got it then 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.989
 uninstalled me that day 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.879
 somehow queried everything was there I was 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.099
 only in the desktop 2 made me sick 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.660
 The whole game is up and then I am 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.239
 I became pure in black ops 1 and then became 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.870
 I just gotten away from Galil with this one 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.010
 the energy is nice too but yes plays 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.879
 with such a gameplay that 's natural 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.959
 understandable and yes I have then 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.430
 just make the match 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.379
 uninstalled and I got it off 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.549
 someday had business from one 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.510
 good buddy that was me and believe 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.500
 that's exactly what I'm going to do 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.639
 probably also reinstall 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.260
 I can do some black ops again 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.549
 import is definitely nice 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.139
 to the gameplay is otherwise actually synonymous 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.790
 not much to say you are 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.040
 reign on jungle as I said 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.540
 have here they make the sometimes quite 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.430
 good with the flanks can be first 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.470
 fall into the backlog here and become 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.849
 then finally here the flags some 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.489
 so that the game is longer is yes 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.530
 logical as the way in jobs will 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.120
 even so that the flags are so that 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.639
 that's not half-time anymore 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.690
 I think that's good, that's 15 at the most 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.169
 minutes, I think that's right 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.500
 Nice can make a lot of kids again 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.210
 and yes, that's exactly what it is 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.180
 I get cod bo by the way for 10 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.870
 Euro, by the way, if you wanted to know that 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.970
 Why 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.740
 I do not tell you secretly wearing yes 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.860
 you know and not somehow 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.970
 something fake imported or something 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.970
 No , no, there are a few 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.080
 tricks how to get it with ten euros 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.550
 and yes, I hope that's what you got 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.840
 please you hear here now either 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.430
 a bit of music or just that 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.660
 gameplay and I want to say if you guys 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.620
 the video has please give it to the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.330
 video just a thumbs up 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.830
 if not then we will listen 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.830
 the next time the skin gets in there
