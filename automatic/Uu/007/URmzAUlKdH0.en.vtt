00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and I was looking for something with

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.170 
and I was looking for something with
more<00:02:00.899> color<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.979> i<00:02:02.009> am<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> neutral<00:02:02.759> girl<00:02:02.909> I

of you don't know these pallets do come
out<00:02:11.819> they<00:02:12.270> lift<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.989> don't<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
out they lift out so you don't have to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.349 
out they lift out so you don't have to
you're<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> whole<00:02:14.640> thing<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:14.879> they<00:02:15.120> rest

you're on the whole thing and they rest
one<00:02:15.629> on<00:02:15.750> top<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.109> other<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.439> just<00:02:16.739> kind<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
one on top of the other I just kind of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.209 
one on top of the other I just kind of
set<00:02:17.310> them<00:02:17.549> there<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.659> so<00:02:19.319> by<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> was

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
set them there like that so by I was

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.990 
set them there like that so by I was
saying<00:02:20.400> they're<00:02:20.700> extremely<00:02:21.090> pigmented<00:02:23.000> 120

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
saying they're extremely pigmented 120

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.830 
saying they're extremely pigmented 120
of<00:02:24.090> them<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.590> i<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.739> show<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.010> version<00:02:26.340> B<00:02:26.840> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
of them and i will show you version B so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.630 
of them and i will show you version B so
you<00:02:28.680> guys<00:02:28.829> can<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.219> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you guys can just kind of see the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.500 
you guys can just kind of see the
difference<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:31.560> version<00:02:31.769> B<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:33.180> you're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
difference here is version B now you're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.629 
difference here is version B now you're
looking<00:02:33.659> at<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.139> and<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.799> first<00:02:35.010> thing<00:02:35.250> you

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
looking at it and the first thing you

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.399 
looking at it and the first thing you
notice<00:02:36.329> is<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.599> they're<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.079> in<00:02:37.230> order

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
notice is that they're not in order

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.170 
notice is that they're not in order
anymore<00:02:37.650> they<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.549> but<00:02:38.730> they're<00:02:38.849> in<00:02:38.969> order

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
anymore they are but they're in order

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110 
anymore they are but they're in order
from<00:02:39.299> top<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.569> bottom<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.969> there's<00:02:41.969> not

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
from top to bottom and there's not

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.330 
from top to bottom and there's not
really<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.359> many<00:02:42.719> of<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.170> specific<00:02:43.379> color<00:02:44.069> or

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
really that many of a specific color or

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.280 
really that many of a specific color or
they're<00:02:44.459> not<00:02:44.489> next<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.939> each<00:02:45.090> other<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.450> it's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
they're not next to each other so it's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.379 
they're not next to each other so it's
probably<00:02:46.500> pretty<00:02:46.739> easy<00:02:47.099> for<00:02:47.639> there<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> have

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
probably pretty easy for there to have

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.360 
probably pretty easy for there to have
been<00:02:48.569> doubles<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.620> some<00:02:49.799> colors<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.310> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
been doubles of some colors and you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.369 
been doubles of some colors and you
wouldn't<00:02:50.579> really<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.819> able<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.120> tell

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
wouldn't really be able to tell

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.420 
wouldn't really be able to tell
perversion<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.889> were<00:02:52.950> next<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.310> each

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
perversion a they were next to each

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.649 
perversion a they were next to each
other<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:53.909> could<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.359> one<00:02:54.540> was

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
other so you could see that one was

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.030 
other so you could see that one was
slightly<00:02:54.900> lighter<00:02:55.230> than<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.590> other<00:02:55.739> slightly

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
slightly lighter than the other slightly

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.270 
slightly lighter than the other slightly
darker<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:57.480> can't<00:02:57.720> really<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.859> that<00:02:58.919> in<00:02:59.159> this

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
darker you can't really do that in this

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.959 
darker you can't really do that in this
case<00:02:59.549> however<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:01.620> palette<00:03:02.370> has<00:03:02.519> way<00:03:02.939> more

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
case however this palette has way more

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.479 
case however this palette has way more
neutral<00:03:03.900> there's<00:03:04.169> a<00:03:04.230> lot<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.620> neutral<00:03:05.219> colors

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
neutral there's a lot of neutral colors

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.709 
neutral there's a lot of neutral colors
in<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:05.700> palette<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.419> the<00:03:06.540> other

and<00:03:07.709> also<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.430> colors<00:03:08.669> aren't<00:03:08.849> as<00:03:09.090> bright

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
and also the colors aren't as bright
