 more and you will get the one 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.970
 signal but the vd in number is gone 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.940

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.680

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.959
 everything said

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.159
 70 and on food I should skip 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.690
 does not matter 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.150

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.940
