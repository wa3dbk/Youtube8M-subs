you can tell this is a hard plastic case
on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> back<00:01:44.909> much<00:01:45.900> like<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:47.040> comparison<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
on the back much like in comparison to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.469 
on the back much like in comparison to
the<00:01:48.830> speck<00:01:49.830> candyshell<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.450> i

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the speck candyshell as you can see i

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660 
the speck candyshell as you can see i
have<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.110> works<00:01:52.530> thick<00:01:52.860> white<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.549> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
have the works thick white think it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.530 
have the works thick white think it's
cold<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.610> hybrid<00:01:56.790> case<00:01:57.180> too

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
cold and this is a hybrid case too

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.109 
cold and this is a hybrid case too
because<00:01:57.900> it's<00:01:58.229> hard<00:01:58.530> plastic<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> outside

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
because it's hard plastic on the outside

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
because it's hard plastic on the outside
with<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.180> soft<00:02:00.509> shell<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> inside<00:02:01.759> stuff

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
with a soft shell on the inside stuff

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.460 
with a soft shell on the inside stuff
about<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.180> though<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.439> see

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
about that though and as you can see

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.969 
about that though and as you can see
there<00:02:05.119> we<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> case-mate<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> logo

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
there we have the case-mate on the logo

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.030 
there we have the case-mate on the logo
there<00:02:08.549> we<00:02:08.670> go<00:02:09.350> you'll<00:02:10.350> also<00:02:10.530> notice<00:02:10.799> that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
there we go you'll also notice that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.390 
there we go you'll also notice that
there's<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> nice<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.079> would<00:02:13.470> God<00:02:13.829> for<00:02:14.010> us<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
similar to a diamond pattern design on

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.100 
similar to a diamond pattern design on
the<00:02:17.130> back

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110

they take that off and you have a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.890 
they take that off and you have a
silicone<00:02:30.110> skin<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:32.240> smooth<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.870> the

on<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:35.480> phone<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.410> which<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.770> do<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:37.220> right

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
on my phone to which I do have right

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.990 
on my phone to which I do have right
here<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.170> know<00:02:39.290> you're<00:02:39.560> dying<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.740> see<00:02:40.040> so

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
here so I know you're dying to see so

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.430 
here so I know you're dying to see so
I'm<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.360> do<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.690> put<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.140> on<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
I'm going to do is just put it on like a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.000 
I'm going to do is just put it on like a
normal<00:02:42.770> silicon<00:02:43.160> skin<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.709> really

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
normal silicon skin and if you really

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.260 
normal silicon skin and if you really
really<00:02:46.160> want<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.520> see<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.700> suppose<00:02:47.090> you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
really want you to see I suppose you

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.540 
really want you to see I suppose you
could<00:02:47.390> actually<00:02:47.540> use<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:48.140> as<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.310> case

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
could actually use this as just the case

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.480 
could actually use this as just the case
in<00:02:49.760> itself<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.480> use<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.370> then

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
in itself just use it like that and then

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.100 
in itself just use it like that and then
just<00:02:52.640> massage<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.180> camera<00:02:53.510> hole<00:02:53.690> into<00:02:53.930> place

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
just massage the camera hole into place

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.229 
just massage the camera hole into place
and<00:02:56.140> there<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.880> designed

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
and there you have it but it is designed

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.229 
and there you have it but it is designed
to<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.690> both<00:02:59.989> protection<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.800> silicon

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
to have both protection of the silicon

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.320 
to have both protection of the silicon
for<00:03:02.239> impact<00:03:02.630> resistance<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.730> hard<00:03:05.060> shell

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
for impact resistance and the hard shell

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.670 
for impact resistance and the hard shell
to<00:03:06.940> stop<00:03:07.940> your<00:03:08.120> phone<00:03:08.390> from<00:03:08.540> being<00:03:08.840> damaged<00:03:09.590> by

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
to stop your phone from being damaged by

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.830 
to stop your phone from being damaged by
the<00:03:09.860> impact<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.830> do<00:03:13.070> get<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:14.030> buttons

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
the impact and you do get the buttons

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.390 
the impact and you do get the buttons
here<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.170> lineup<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:15.680> what<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.890> like<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.160> do

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
here the lineup that's what I like to do

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.479 
here the lineup that's what I like to do
first<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:18.140> line<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.380> up<00:03:18.590> like<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.010> with

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
first and you line it up like so with

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.330 
first and you line it up like so with
the<00:03:19.580> whole<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> ABS<00:03:20.330> case<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.470> then<00:03:22.250> you

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
the whole of the ABS case and then you

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.860 
the whole of the ABS case and then you
just<00:03:22.519> make<00:03:22.880> sure<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:23.450> sitting

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
just make sure that it's sitting

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.220 
just make sure that it's sitting
correctly<00:03:24.799> down<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> left-hand<00:03:25.610> side<00:03:25.850> here

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
correctly down the left-hand side here

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.270 
correctly down the left-hand side here
before<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.700> gently<00:03:30.250> push<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
before you then just gently push the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.789 
before you then just gently push the
silicon<00:03:31.880> on<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.930> right-hand<00:03:33.290> side<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.709> just

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
silicon on the right-hand side and just

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.100 
silicon on the right-hand side and just
making<00:03:34.010> sure<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.459> it's<00:03:34.580> set<00:03:34.790> properly<00:03:35.269> as

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
making sure that it's set properly as

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.160 
making sure that it's set properly as
you<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:36.350> see<00:03:36.620> there<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:37.010> have<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.720> case-mate<00:03:38.720> I

and then you have the volume rockers
it's<00:04:15.230> due<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.709> job<00:04:15.920> they<00:04:16.160> do<00:04:16.280> look<00:04:16.489> level

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
it's due to the job they do look level

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.840 
it's due to the job they do look level
to<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.600> case<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:18.590> sticking<00:04:19.310> out<00:04:19.430> too<00:04:19.669> much

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
to the case not sticking out too much

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.520 
to the case not sticking out too much
and<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:21.620> also<00:04:21.799> have<00:04:21.979> access<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.530> vibrate

and you also have access to the vibrate

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.440 
and you also have access to the vibrate
toggle<00:04:24.860> which<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.850> little<00:04:26.090> bit<00:04:26.240> difficult

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.939 
little bit too far you do also have full
access<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.750> thickened<00:04:36.229> dock<00:04:36.440> connector

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
access to the thickened dock connector

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.219 
access to the thickened dock connector
as<00:04:37.940> well<00:04:38.120> as<00:04:38.240> your<00:04:38.389> speaker<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.110> your

as well as your speaker and your
microphone<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.580> you'll<00:04:41.090> see<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.449> the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
microphone and you'll see that the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.719 
microphone and you'll see that the
actual<00:04:42.320> case<00:04:42.710> does<00:04:42.949> cover<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.340> bezel<00:04:43.639> and

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
actual case does cover the bezel and

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.760 
actual case does cover the bezel and
does<00:04:44.150> have<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> very<00:04:44.630> very<00:04:44.870> nice<00:04:45.169> lay<00:04:45.620> on<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
does have a very very nice lay on the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.830 
does have a very very nice lay on the
table<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.759> you<00:04:46.789> can<00:04:46.880> drop<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.210> quite

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
table so you can drop that quite

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.050 
table so you can drop that quite
comfortably<00:04:48.289> and<00:04:48.560> because<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.669> silicone

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
comfortably and because of the silicone

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.460 
comfortably and because of the silicone
around<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.389> edges<00:04:50.509> and<00:04:50.900> not<00:04:51.050> have<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.440> worry

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
around the edges and not have to worry

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.060 
around the edges and not have to worry
about<00:04:51.770> anything<00:04:52.190> damaging<00:04:52.759> your<00:04:52.910> screen

about anything damaging your screen

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.090 
about anything damaging your screen
obviously<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.400> meant<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.729> be<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:57.830> soft

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
obviously this is meant to be the soft

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.350 
obviously this is meant to be the soft
light<00:04:58.250> case<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:58.699> you<00:04:58.789> have<00:04:58.940> on<00:04:59.060> your<00:04:59.150> phone

light case that you have on your phone

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.969 
light case that you have on your phone
which<00:05:02.080> protect<00:05:03.080> your<00:05:03.229> phone<00:05:03.350> from<00:05:03.410> impact

both<00:05:07.490> top<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:07.910> bottom<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:09.699> would<00:05:10.699> give<00:05:10.850> this

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
both top and bottom I would give this

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.740 
both top and bottom I would give this
case<00:05:11.240> an<00:05:11.510> 8<00:05:12.260> out<00:05:12.979> of<00:05:13.039> 10<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:14.360> reason<00:05:14.600> why<00:05:14.720> I

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
case an 8 out of 10 and the reason why I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.170 
case an 8 out of 10 and the reason why I
gave<00:05:14.960> give<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.530> an<00:05:15.680> eight<00:05:15.830> out<00:05:16.039> of<00:05:16.100> 10<00:05:16.520> is

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
gave give it an eight out of 10 is

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.570 
gave give it an eight out of 10 is
because<00:05:17.660> that<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.320> silicon<00:05:19.070> feels<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.460> little

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
because that the silicon feels a little

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.150 
because that the silicon feels a little
bit<00:05:19.789> flimsy<00:05:20.270> here<00:05:20.510> at<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.169> bottom<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.710> I

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
bit flimsy here at the bottom and I

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.290 
bit flimsy here at the bottom and I
don't<00:05:22.310> know<00:05:22.400> how<00:05:22.610> long<00:05:22.729> it's<00:05:22.940> going<00:05:23.060> to<00:05:23.150> hold

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
don't know how long it's going to hold

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.379 
don't know how long it's going to hold
up<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:24.800> might<00:05:25.160> start<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.639> sag<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:25.940> go<00:05:26.240> out

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
up and it might start to sag and go out

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.890 
up and it might start to sag and go out
of<00:05:26.479> shape<00:05:26.720> but<00:05:27.020> only<00:05:27.830> time<00:05:28.070> will<00:05:28.130> tell<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.900> the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
of shape but only time will tell and the

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.810 
of shape but only time will tell and the
second<00:05:30.770> thing<00:05:30.800> is<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.340> fact<00:05:31.370> that<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:31.699> would

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
second thing is the fact that I would

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.450 
second thing is the fact that I would
have<00:05:31.910> liked<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.150> have<00:05:32.300> seen<00:05:32.599> so<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.710> headphone

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
have liked to have seen so a headphone

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.129 
have liked to have seen so a headphone
plug<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:36.169> 30-pin<00:05:36.620> dock<00:05:36.789> protector<00:05:37.789> and

plug and a 30-pin dock protector and
like<00:05:39.139> you<00:05:39.229> get<00:05:39.380> with<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.680> otterbox<00:05:40.220> and

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
like you get with the otterbox and

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.240 
like you get with the otterbox and
commute<00:05:41.360> at<00:05:41.479> er<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.810> think<00:05:42.080> it's<00:05:42.229> called<00:05:42.440> the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
commute at er I think it's called the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
commute at er I think it's called the
blue<00:05:43.430> one<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:43.639> have<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:46.220> already<00:05:46.460> has<00:05:46.789> the

blue one I have and that already has the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.810 
blue one I have and that already has the
