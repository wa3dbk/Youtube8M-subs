from<00:05:38.990> these<00:05:39.200> fruits<00:05:39.560> it's<00:05:40.100> a<00:05:40.280> great<00:05:40.640> way<00:05:40.910> to

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
from these fruits it's a great way to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.360 
from these fruits it's a great way to
drink<00:05:41.420> water<00:05:41.660> it<00:05:42.170> also<00:05:42.290> tastes<00:05:42.890> really<00:05:43.100> great

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
drink water it also tastes really great

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.770 
drink water it also tastes really great
it<00:05:43.730> gives<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.030> water<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.270> little<00:05:44.420> bit<00:05:44.570> more

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
it gives the water a little bit more

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.060 
it gives the water a little bit more
flavor<00:05:44.990> if<00:05:45.350> say<00:05:45.560> you're<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.860> type<00:05:46.040> that

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
flavor if say you're the type that

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.670 
flavor if say you're the type that
doesn't<00:05:46.460> really<00:05:46.760> like<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.960> flavor<00:05:48.200> of<00:05:48.380> water

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
doesn't really like the flavor of water

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.710 
doesn't really like the flavor of water
which<00:05:49.370> doesn't<00:05:49.970> really<00:05:50.090> have<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:50.300> flavor<00:05:50.510> I

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
which doesn't really have a flavor I

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.200 
which doesn't really have a flavor I
guess<00:05:50.990> maybe<00:05:51.260> that's<00:05:51.470> why<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:52.790> it<00:05:53.180> looks

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
guess maybe that's why so and it looks

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.420 
guess maybe that's why so and it looks
really<00:05:53.600> cool<00:05:53.930> so<00:05:54.290> this<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.680> what<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:54.860> have<00:05:55.250> been
