brassy color and the green and comparing

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.689 
brassy color and the green and comparing
this<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.289> flats<00:00:19.680> black<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.550> thought

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
this with the flats black I just thought

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.779 
this with the flats black I just thought
that<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:21.029> such<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> wonderful<00:00:21.420> combination

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
that was such a wonderful combination

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.080 
that was such a wonderful combination
and<00:00:23.789> i<00:00:23.880> also<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.960> veronica<00:00:26.090> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and i also like this the veronica and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.519 
and i also like this the veronica and
the<00:00:27.960> smaller<00:00:28.289> leaf<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:29.369> those<00:00:29.609> time<00:00:29.939> yeah<00:00:30.529> well

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the smaller leaf at those time yeah well

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590 
the smaller leaf at those time yeah well
they<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.250> wonderful<00:00:32.880> combinations

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
they all are wonderful combinations

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
they all are wonderful combinations
because<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> contrasting<00:00:34.800> textures

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
because of the contrasting textures

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.610 
because of the contrasting textures
however<00:00:36.120> Verna<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.690> plant<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> too<00:00:37.410> mature

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
however Verna this plant is too mature

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.410 
however Verna this plant is too mature
for<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.219> way<00:00:38.370> we're<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> dash

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
for the way we're going to do the dash

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
for the way we're going to do the dash
and<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> think<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.710> better<00:00:40.860> stick<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489

underneath<00:02:07.019> just<00:02:08.019> kind<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.009> study<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.489> up

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
underneath just kind of study it up

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.080 
underneath just kind of study it up
against<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.060> wire<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:10.959> go<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:12.090> now

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
against the wire there we go and now

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.309 
against the wire there we go and now
I'll<00:02:13.300> poke<00:02:13.510> some<00:02:13.780> down<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.019> side<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:17.200> be

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
I'll poke some down the side will be

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.400 
I'll poke some down the side will be
able<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.709> add<00:02:18.220> more<00:02:18.790> moths<00:02:19.120> from<00:02:19.540> outside<00:02:20.080> once

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
able to add more moths from outside once

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.680 
able to add more moths from outside once
we've<00:02:20.560> closed<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.099> back<00:02:21.220> up<00:02:21.400> again<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.510> we

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
we've closed and back up again but we

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.300 
we've closed and back up again but we
might<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:22.989> well<00:02:23.049> get<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.410> much<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.620> we<00:02:23.769> can<00:02:24.099> in

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
might as well get as much as we can in

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.860 
might as well get as much as we can in
now<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.959> just<00:02:25.989> pack<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.440> firmly<00:02:30.569> there<00:02:31.569> we<00:02:31.690> go

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
now so just pack it firmly there we go

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.319 
now so just pack it firmly there we go
so<00:02:32.739> any<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.130> these<00:02:33.250> animals<00:02:33.790> could<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.090> plant

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
so any of these animals could you plant

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.089 
so any of these animals could you plant
from<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> inside<00:02:35.049> like<00:02:35.319> you're<00:02:35.500> doing<00:02:35.709> now<00:02:35.739> or

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
from the inside like you're doing now or

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.860 
from the inside like you're doing now or
from<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.370> outside<00:02:36.849> as<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.180> did<00:02:37.360> before<00:02:37.480> I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
from the outside as you did before I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870 
from the outside as you did before I
think<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.260> depends<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.769> lot<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.370> amount<00:02:39.700> of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
think it depends a lot on the amount of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.509 
think it depends a lot on the amount of
cavity<00:02:40.329> space<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.489> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
cavity space that you have this is a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.949 
cavity space that you have this is a
good<00:02:42.790> size<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.239> takes<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.599> three-inch

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
good size it takes a three-inch

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.740 
good size it takes a three-inch
perennial<00:02:44.440> very<00:02:44.650> nicely<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:46.120> also<00:02:46.329> possible

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
perennial very nicely it's also possible

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.569 
perennial very nicely it's also possible
to<00:02:47.079> reduce<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.620> root<00:02:47.769> system<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.340> it's<00:02:48.519> a

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
to reduce the root system if it's a

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.180 
to reduce the root system if it's a
little<00:02:48.730> tighter<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.989> can<00:02:50.170> always<00:02:50.410> knock<00:02:50.739> some

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
little tighter you can always knock some

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.940 
little tighter you can always knock some
of<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.489> soil<00:02:51.910> off<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.569> some<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.319> roots<00:02:53.500> if

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
of the soil off and some of the roots if

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.890 
of the soil off and some of the roots if
you<00:02:54.160> need<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> get<00:02:54.579> into<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.880> tighter<00:02:55.209> space<00:02:55.630> or

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
you need to get into a tighter space or

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.590 
you need to get into a tighter space or
you<00:02:56.410> could<00:02:56.590> also<00:02:56.769> cut<00:02:57.280> them<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.519> half<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:58.209> put

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
you could also cut them in half and put

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.360 
you could also cut them in half and put
half<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:59.019> one<00:02:59.230> side<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.739> half<00:02:59.889> on<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.340> other

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
half on one side and half on the other

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.180 
half on one side and half on the other
case<00:03:00.850> but<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:01.870> animal<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.500> perfect<00:03:02.980> fit

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
case but this animal is a perfect fit

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.069 
case but this animal is a perfect fit
for<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.819> three-inch<00:03:04.150> perennial<00:03:04.600> okay<00:03:04.870> now<00:03:05.049> I

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
for the three-inch perennial okay now I

could<00:03:44.950> just<00:03:45.010> study<00:03:45.430> him<00:03:45.700> there<00:03:45.910> Verna<00:03:46.120> that

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
could just study him there Verna that

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.140 
could just study him there Verna that
would<00:03:46.510> be<00:03:46.630> terrific<00:03:47.040> I've<00:03:48.040> got<00:03:48.280> him<00:03:48.519> loosely

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
would be terrific I've got him loosely

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.120 
would be terrific I've got him loosely
positioned<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.019> then<00:03:50.560> I'm<00:03:50.680> going<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.010> do

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
positioned and then I'm going to do

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.000 
positioned and then I'm going to do
another<00:03:51.400> piece<00:03:51.760> across<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.510> same<00:03:52.750> way<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.260> see

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
another piece across the same way I see

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.400 
another piece across the same way I see
you're<00:03:54.160> doing<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.549> on<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.730> diagonal<00:03:55.209> yeah<00:03:55.989> why

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410
