00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.260
 friends, I'm going to make you a new one 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.110
 recipe that this is a bit of luxury 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.480
 the night yes luxury although it has 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.720
 rabbit statement is a homemade pate 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.470
 that I sincerely believe that we can not 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.320
 make it a luxury and you will see how rich it is 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.170
 Snacks and as a snack food 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.649
 or dinner you already know a bit of statesmen 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.750
 of bread was hot look to do it 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:42.170
 I have rabbit liver lard 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:47.239
 cream in america you call cream 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.950
 I have a pair of eyes an onion salt and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.890
 cornstarch good with these 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.500
 ingredients I'm going to do the first day 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.649
 sautÃ© the onion and garlic as long as stein 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.320
 almost done I will add you in league 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.840
 rabbit cut of pieces and then good 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 then pose with the cognac add the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.310
 cream and finally anger 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.990
 these are the steps to follow but as 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.640
 you see 600 because it does not have much 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.520
 merit as it explains now 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.159
 let's start with the sofrito vale I'll go 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.830
 to cut it with the onion and when 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.280
 have the pan I am with you good 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.460
 the onion is already speaking to me well 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 fix 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.920
 this already because it's about almost 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.320
 hour 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.320
 to put rabbit liver 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.400
 I 've chopped it into small pieces 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.300
 for first pair to be done before and 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.770
 later so that it costs me very little 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.890
 pass it through the blender because this 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 then obviously it's gone good 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.640
 the salt 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.860
 I already have here in nightmare to not 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.860
 spend a day 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.920
 and now I'm going to put 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.920
 black pepper 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.510
 a good black cut and I'm going to talk 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.989
 with the loves of the countryside a little bit 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.989
 from rosemary 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.290
 each one you can do a little bit to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.959
 your taste is also that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.689
 they are injured, they give me many 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.689
 canaries basil and laurel 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.510
 there is a drip 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.450
 now 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.720
 to coordinate 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.269
 and the 7 is already missing is already jumping 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 we put ourselves has only in santa de 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.080
 mens 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.110
 we have practically done this 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 now I'm going to roll 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.560
 and this must be stated what happens is 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.190
 that as I have told you the times 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.540
 You have to learn it 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.540
 always good time 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.590
 I think I said 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.850
 but it's always important 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.530
 below the bell is not a game because 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.930
 is the bells always have something of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.420
 grease 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.459
 and in this way 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.460
 we avoid any possible fire 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.600
 good 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.270
 Now let's put it as you see 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.120
 the end 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.120
 of how this paper is cooked 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.090
 once beaten 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.090
 I'm going to add the cream 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.609
 what is everything 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.800
 as cream to mount milk cream 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:17.630
 in America as you know well then 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.630
 there is a part that feels is thick 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.540
 Now I cook this 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.330
 we give him 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.790
 we prepare the blender this is a glass 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.670
 just from these a glass of these from 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.440
 the blender can be made although I 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.890
 I think to see if I can do it 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.020
 in one of these metal molds that 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.920
 I have better because I leave them there 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.470
 cool down and since it will be he who is 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.390
 Now you see it is liquid, so what 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.810
 going to make is curds to curdle that 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.790
 say form as a kind of cream 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.969
 which is what we know as a kick 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.679
 cobras 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.200
 good though it's not that hard to do 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:06.440
 rinse at home erased 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:09.500
 or for you because this is all that a 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.190
 minutes and cooking 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.010
 and then it happened with the blender and you 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.470
 I teach at the end good friends friends 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.590
 here you have the pate already made step by 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.140
 blender and what's on this plate 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.250
 big in this bowl 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.780
 Well, they leave you cooling all the 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.760
 night it gets cold I put it in the camera 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.220
 and tomorrow I will present the result 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.990
 end you have so nice at home 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.660

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.030

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.480

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.860
 final result 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.230
 Well, the day has already passed, that is the 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.380
 night he's been going over the fridge 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.020

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.780
 and we have it ready to eat what 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.900
 I have there with bread toast that 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.150
 they carry blueberries let's say inside the bread 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.610
 a little flavor remains a special touch and 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.040
 what discs say that one thing is so 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.590
 simple and uses bound of rabbits 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.650
 but you can use pork liver and 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.230
 it is used is duck liver we are going 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:19.130
 what is the board ice croft but the bid is 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.750
 to use economic things and this is 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.670
 it happened to me because as now with the 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.970
