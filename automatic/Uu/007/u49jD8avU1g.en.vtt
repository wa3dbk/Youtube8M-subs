00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
well use the same technique that we used

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.449 
well use the same technique that we used
on<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.080> pinky<00:02:28.409> nail<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.860> painting<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
on the pinky nail with painting the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.729 
on the pinky nail with painting the
clouds<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.480> paint<00:02:30.720> maybe<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.319> or<00:02:31.709> two

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
clouds but just paint maybe one or two

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:42.180 
clouds but just paint maybe one or two
clouds<00:02:32.519> at<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.879> very<00:02:33.239> top<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> nail

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.100 

when<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.370> unpainted<00:02:43.850> some<00:02:44.210> grass<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.750> tip<00:02:44.960> of

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
when in unpainted some grass the tip of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.630 
when in unpainted some grass the tip of
the<00:02:45.170> nail<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:45.830> we've<00:02:46.070> realized<00:02:46.490> that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the nail but then we've realized that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.670 
the nail but then we've realized that
when<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.970> need<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.210> go<00:02:47.330> over<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.200> cover<00:02:48.440> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
when you need to go over it and cover it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.890 
when you need to go over it and cover it
pretty<00:02:48.920> much<00:02:49.100> with<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.580> black<00:02:49.880> acrylic<00:02:50.720> paint

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
pretty much with the black acrylic paint

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.420 
pretty much with the black acrylic paint
to<00:02:51.410> outline<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.310> fill<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.660> pot<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.080> gold

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
to outline and fill in the pot of gold

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.910 
to outline and fill in the pot of gold
so<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.940> maybe<00:02:56.390> skip<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.990> step<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.620> add

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
so you maybe skip this step and then add

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:14.910 
so you maybe skip this step and then add
the<00:02:58.100> grass<00:02:58.340> later

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.790 

then<00:03:15.920> dabbing<00:03:16.400> some<00:03:17.060> nail<00:03:17.690> glue<00:03:18.080> on<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.560> top

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
then dabbing some nail glue on the top

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.560 
then dabbing some nail glue on the top
of<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.100> pot<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.400> gold<00:03:19.430> we're<00:03:20.210> using<00:03:20.390> these

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
of the pot of gold we're using these

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.540 
of the pot of gold we're using these
gold<00:03:21.020> microbeads<00:03:21.740> to<00:03:22.040> kind<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.340> give<00:03:22.460> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
gold microbeads to kind of give the
