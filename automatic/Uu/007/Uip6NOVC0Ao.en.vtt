00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
with the juggernaut and I would be the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
with the juggernaut and I would be the
first<00:00:15.030> person<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.480> admit<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.470> class

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
first person to admit that this class

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.460 
first person to admit that this class
setup<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> broken<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.180> needs<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.960> fixed

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
setup is broken and needs to be fixed

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.980 
setup is broken and needs to be fixed
and<00:00:20.340> maybe<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.000> main<00:00:21.150> reason<00:00:21.570> i<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.810> using

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and maybe the main reason i was using

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.370 
and maybe the main reason i was using
this<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.619> i<00:00:23.840> needed<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.019> get<00:00:25.170> some

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
this was because i needed to get some

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.580 
this was because i needed to get some
challenges<00:00:25.859> done<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.400> goes<00:00:26.550> only<00:00:26.670> level<00:00:27.590> 12

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
challenges done that goes only level 12

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.840 
challenges done that goes only level 12
here<00:00:29.010> maybe<00:00:29.929> 13<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.740> i<00:00:32.009> didn't<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.669> whole

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
here maybe 13 so i didn't have a whole

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.090 
here maybe 13 so i didn't have a whole
lot<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.090> options<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.840> terms<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.710> weapon

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
lot of options in terms of which weapon

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.150 
lot of options in terms of which weapon
i<00:00:35.190> could<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
i could use so that of this of the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.150 
i could use so that of this of the
thompson<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.350> well<00:00:40.350> i<00:00:40.379> usually<00:00:40.710> use<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
thompson and well i usually use the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.700 
thompson and well i usually use the
Thompson<00:00:41.750> well<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.050> usually<00:00:43.379> using<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Thompson well I was usually using a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.069 
Thompson well I was usually using a
Thompson<00:00:44.100> given<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.579> lack<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.969> weapon<00:00:45.510> variety

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
Thompson given my lack of weapon variety

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.069 
Thompson given my lack of weapon variety
so<00:00:46.920> um<00:00:47.309> hopefully<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.270> don't<00:00:48.629> show<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.809> page
