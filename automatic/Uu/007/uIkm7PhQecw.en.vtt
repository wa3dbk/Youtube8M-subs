00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
whatever else so you go through and you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
whatever else so you go through and you
list<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:45.030> different<00:01:45.240> interests<00:01:45.899> and

list all your different interests and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.249

then<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> does<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.610> brings<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.540> people

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
then what it does is it brings up people

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
then what it does is it brings up people
who<00:01:49.740> also<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> same<00:01:50.729> thing<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.450> common

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
who also have the same thing in common

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.230 
who also have the same thing in common
with<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.040> basically<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.030> way<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.469 
with you and so basically it's a way to
match<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> find<00:01:55.649> people<00:01:55.890> who<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:57.450> would

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
match up and find people who you would

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300
