00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of Braska seeds and threw them

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.040 
of Braska seeds and threw them
everywhere

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.440

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
I just wanted to see how things would

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.630 
I just wanted to see how things would
grow<00:00:47.930> I<00:00:47.960> know<00:00:48.380> brassicas<00:00:49.040> especially<00:00:49.490> like

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
grow I know brassicas especially like

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.150 
grow I know brassicas especially like
turnips<00:00:50.240> and<00:00:50.330> kale<00:00:50.710> they<00:00:51.710> come<00:00:51.890> up<00:00:52.010> really

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
turnips and kale they come up really

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.290 
turnips and kale they come up really
easy<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.520> have<00:00:52.640> really<00:00:52.820> good<00:00:52.940> germination

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
easy to have really good germination

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.120 
easy to have really good germination
rate<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.810> I<00:00:54.230> just<00:00:54.470> want<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.740> see<00:00:54.860> how<00:00:54.980> they

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
rate and I just want to see how they

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.950 
rate and I just want to see how they
would<00:00:55.280> do<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.300> have<00:00:56.450> some<00:00:56.630> really<00:00:56.810> cool

stuff I want to show you here we go now
I<00:01:03.050> was<00:01:03.740> actually<00:01:03.890> surprised<00:01:04.490> that<00:01:04.820> they're

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
I was actually surprised that they're

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.920 
I was actually surprised that they're
growing<00:01:05.690> everywhere<00:01:07.540> this<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.810> think

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
growing everywhere this is I think

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.890 
growing everywhere this is I think
turnips<00:01:09.830> there's<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.910> whole<00:01:11.180> all<00:01:11.480> this<00:01:11.720> down

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
turnips there's a whole all this down

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.080 
turnips there's a whole all this down
here<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.380> big<00:01:12.560> patch<00:01:12.800> of<00:01:13.100> them<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.430> could

wild<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.380> here<00:01:50.590> let's<00:01:51.590> see<00:01:51.740> how<00:01:51.800> they<00:01:51.920> taste

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
wild in here let's see how they taste

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.460 
wild in here let's see how they taste
I<00:01:52.429> got<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.000> couple<00:01:53.179> leaves<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.600> tried<00:01:54.229> to<00:01:54.320> use<00:01:54.440> a

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
I got a couple leaves I tried to use a

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.460 
I got a couple leaves I tried to use a
good<00:01:54.710> mixture<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:56.539> bag<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:56.990> was<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.410> I

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
good mixture the bag that I was that I

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710 
good mixture the bag that I was that I
was<00:01:57.530> spreading<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.789> actually<00:01:59.149> had<00:01:59.270> daikon

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
was spreading it actually had daikon

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.240 
was spreading it actually had daikon
radishes<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.830> had<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.550> think<00:02:01.910> they<00:02:02.179> were<00:02:02.240> Pisgah

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
radishes it had I think they were Pisgah

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.510 
radishes it had I think they were Pisgah
turnips<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.750> purple<00:02:05.750> top<00:02:05.899> turnips<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:07.160> I<00:02:07.220> got

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:25.370 

that<00:02:14.600> was<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> radish

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.440 

mmm<00:02:26.070> both<00:02:26.460> radishes<00:02:27.470> very<00:02:28.470> cool<00:02:29.120> all<00:02:30.120> right

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
mmm both radishes very cool all right

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.600 
mmm both radishes very cool all right
here's<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.020> whole<00:02:31.290> bunch<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> big<00:02:32.340> patch

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
here's a whole bunch on a big patch

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.210 
here's a whole bunch on a big patch
growing<00:02:33.090> down<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:34.200> looks<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.860> lot<00:02:35.190> of

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
growing down here it looks like a lot of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.640 
growing down here it looks like a lot of
the<00:02:35.400> waters<00:02:35.760> running<00:02:36.030> downhill<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.750> washed<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the waters running downhill and washed a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.730 
the waters running downhill and washed a
lot<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> seeds<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.610> little<00:02:38.940> spots<00:02:39.240> I

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
lot of the seeds into little spots I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.160 
lot of the seeds into little spots I
scatter<00:02:40.740> them<00:02:40.980> pretty<00:02:41.220> good<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.810> all

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
scatter them pretty good but this is all

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.770 
scatter them pretty good but this is all
these<00:02:43.500> little<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:45.000> things<00:02:45.090> growing<00:02:45.510> down

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
these little little things growing down

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.800 
these little little things growing down
here<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:47.300> brassicas<00:02:48.300> kale<00:02:48.570> turnips<00:02:50.600> here

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.840 

so<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.790> grow<00:02:57.000> food<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:59.220> by<00:02:59.370> simply

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
so you can grow food just by simply

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.180 
so you can grow food just by simply
throwing<00:03:00.090> seeds<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:02.190> over<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.820> place<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
throwing seeds all over the place and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.060 
throwing seeds all over the place and
the<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.340> conditions<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:09.830> don't<00:03:10.830> know

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
the right conditions I don't know

great<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.530> had<00:03:52.830> really<00:03:53.040> good<00:03:53.120> germination<00:03:54.120> with

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
great I had really good germination with

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.420 
great I had really good germination with
them<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.630> my<00:03:54.720> containers<00:03:55.140> at<00:03:55.260> home<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.620> use<00:03:56.160> them

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
them in my containers at home I use them

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.430 
them in my containers at home I use them
as<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> cover<00:03:56.820> crop<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.840> figured<00:03:58.170> they'd<00:03:58.290> do

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
as a cover crop so I figured they'd do

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.920

great out here you know the conditions

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.210 
great out here you know the conditions
are<00:04:01.050> right<00:04:01.170> there<00:04:01.350> are<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> few<00:04:01.680> spots<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.070> I
