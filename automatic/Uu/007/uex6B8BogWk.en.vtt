that circle area is and in there is exos

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.289 
that circle area is and in there is exos
land<00:01:45.619> that's<00:01:45.920> what<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.310> little<00:01:46.970> picture

I<00:01:54.049> believe<00:01:54.350> gives<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> some<00:01:54.979> perks<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.520> some

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
I believe gives you some perks and some

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.429 
I believe gives you some perks and some
movement<00:01:56.450> abilities<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.110> I'm<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.259> sure

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
movement abilities but I'm not sure

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.350 
movement abilities but I'm not sure
exactly<00:01:57.890> what<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.430> gives<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.210> it's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
exactly what that gives you but it's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.760 
exactly what that gives you but it's
things<00:01:59.570> like<00:01:59.689> you're<00:01:59.990> allowed<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.380> sprint

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
things like you're allowed to sprint

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.109 
things like you're allowed to sprint
while<00:02:00.920> shooting<00:02:01.159> things<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.909> and

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
while shooting things like that and

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.749 
while shooting things like that and
better<00:02:02.479> hipfire<00:02:02.899> accuracy<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:04.340> at<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.549> top

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
better hipfire accuracy now at the top

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.910 
better hipfire accuracy now at the top
there<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.509> see<00:02:05.720> where<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.020> exosuits<00:02:06.680> are

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
there you can see where the exosuits are

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.350 
there you can see where the exosuits are
very<00:02:07.189> important<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.700> get<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.939> those<00:02:08.060> quite

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
very important to get to those quite

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.180 
very important to get to those quite
quickly<00:02:08.660> because<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.380> EXO<00:02:09.799> movement

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
quickly because the EXO movement

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.830 
quickly because the EXO movement
especially<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.790> starting<00:02:11.209> area<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.630> a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
especially in the starting area is a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.930 
especially in the starting area is a
very<00:02:12.260> very<00:02:12.530> easy<00:02:12.680> way<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.220> get<00:02:13.549> away<00:02:13.640> from<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
very very easy way to get away from the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.250 
very very easy way to get away from the
zombies<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.360> you're<00:02:14.480> definitely<00:02:14.780> gonna<00:02:15.140> need

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
zombies and you're definitely gonna need

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.199 
zombies and you're definitely gonna need
that<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> later<00:02:16.430> rounds<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:16.940> I'm<00:02:17.030> sure

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
that for the later rounds but I'm sure

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.440 
that for the later rounds but I'm sure
you<00:02:17.390> guys<00:02:17.570> will<00:02:17.810> find<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.410> one<00:02:18.620> just<00:02:18.920> fine

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
you guys will find that one just fine

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.880 
you guys will find that one just fine
also<00:02:20.450> there<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:20.989> right<00:02:21.260> hand<00:02:21.500> side<00:02:21.739> you

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
also there on the right hand side you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.290 
also there on the right hand side you
can<00:02:21.920> see<00:02:22.069> you've<00:02:22.310> got<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.610> speed<00:02:22.940> reload

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
can see you've got the speed reload

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.740 
can see you've got the speed reload
speed

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
speed

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.990 
speed
is<00:02:24.050> always<00:02:24.440> important<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.130> zombies<00:02:25.820> but

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
is always important in zombies but

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.400 
is always important in zombies but
probably<00:02:26.330> not<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.540> one<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.900> were<00:02:27.020> gonna<00:02:27.230> want

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
probably not the one you were gonna want

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.200 
probably not the one you were gonna want
to<00:02:27.470> get<00:02:27.590> first<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.130> then<00:02:28.520> actually<00:02:28.850> me<00:02:29.030> your

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
to get first and then actually me your

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.150 
to get first and then actually me your
starting<00:02:29.660> area<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:30.440> medical<00:02:30.680> symbol

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
starting area that little medical symbol

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.130 
starting area that little medical symbol
is<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.700> quick<00:02:31.970> revive<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.600> obviously<00:02:32.930> if

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
is the quick revive and obviously if

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.600 
is the quick revive and obviously if
you're<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.560> playing<00:02:33.800> solo<00:02:34.220> that's

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
you're going to be playing solo that's

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.220 
you're going to be playing solo that's
gonna<00:02:34.850> be<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.210> self<00:02:35.480> revive<00:02:35.810> thing<00:02:36.020> that's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
gonna be the self revive thing that's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.050 
gonna be the self revive thing that's
gonna<00:02:36.380> lay<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.680> get<00:02:37.010> up<00:02:37.130> from<00:02:37.610> being<00:02:37.790> knocked

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
gonna lay to get up from being knocked

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.360 
gonna lay to get up from being knocked
down<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.630> not<00:02:38.840> many<00:02:39.050> abilities<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.740> this<00:02:39.890> just

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
down so not many abilities in this just

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.830 
down so not many abilities in this just
a<00:02:40.520> few<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.880> them<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.270> there's<00:02:41.420> quite<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.660> lot<00:02:41.780> of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
a few of them but there's quite a lot of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080 
a few of them but there's quite a lot of
variances<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:43.100> game<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.520> I'll<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.790> into

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
variances in this game that I'll go into

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
variances in this game that I'll go into
a<00:02:44.120> little<00:02:44.360> bit<00:02:44.480> later<00:02:44.690> another<00:02:45.410> thing<00:02:45.709> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
a little bit later another thing to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.890 
a little bit later another thing to
actually<00:02:46.130> make<00:02:46.310> know<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.480> zombies

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
actually make know of is in this zombies

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.330 
actually make know of is in this zombies
it<00:02:48.020> works<00:02:48.230> similar<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.560> other<00:02:48.860> ones<00:02:49.100> where<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
it works similar to other ones where you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.980 
it works similar to other ones where you
have<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.580> turn<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> power<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.570> each<00:02:50.720> air

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
have to turn the power one in each air

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.770 
have to turn the power one in each air
area<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.920> access<00:02:52.459> what's<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.030> area<00:02:53.630> it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
area to access what's in that area it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.720 
area to access what's in that area it's
not<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:54.080> some<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.530> older<00:02:54.920> zombies<00:02:55.280> where

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
not like some of the older zombies where

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.010 
not like some of the older zombies where
you<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.000> turn<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.209> power<00:02:56.600> switch<00:02:56.900> on

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
you just turn one power switch on

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.140 
you just turn one power switch on
everything's<00:02:57.830> powered<00:02:58.070> up<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.880> instance

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150

area<00:04:24.500> where<00:04:24.680> quick<00:04:24.919> revive<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:25.790> just

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
area where quick revive is it's just

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.640 
area where quick revive is it's just
move<00:04:26.180> through<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.810> door<00:04:26.990> just<00:04:27.020> there<00:04:27.470> and

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
move through the door just there and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.469 
move through the door just there and
then<00:04:27.979> you<00:04:28.130> very<00:04:28.400> simply<00:04:28.669> just<00:04:28.760> press<00:04:29.090> reload

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
then you very simply just press reload

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.360 
then you very simply just press reload
on<00:04:29.630> there<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.780> think<00:04:29.840> it's<00:04:30.140> quite<00:04:30.290> cheap<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:31.130> use

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
on there I think it's quite cheap to use

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.339 
on there I think it's quite cheap to use
that<00:04:31.580> thing<00:04:31.880> it's<00:04:32.270> very<00:04:32.300> easy<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.810> use<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:33.229> you

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
that thing it's very easy to use but you

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.839 
that thing it's very easy to use but you
have<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.710> make<00:04:33.860> sure<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.340> get<00:04:34.520> there

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
have to make sure that you get there

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.450 
have to make sure that you get there
otherwise<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.660> will<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.900> down

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
otherwise you will be down

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.040 
otherwise you will be down
so<00:04:36.639> that's<00:04:36.880> another<00:04:37.090> little<00:04:37.180> added<00:04:37.690> element

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
so that's another little added element

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.360 
so that's another little added element
to<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:38.440> game<00:04:38.680> that's<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:39.009> little<00:04:39.190> bit

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
to this game that's a little bit

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.010 
to this game that's a little bit
different<00:04:39.610> another<00:04:40.270> thing<00:04:40.449> to<00:04:40.569> note<00:04:40.720> as<00:04:40.870> well

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
different another thing to note as well

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.590 
different another thing to note as well
is<00:04:41.289> that<00:04:41.319> the<00:04:41.590> blue<00:04:41.860> zombies<00:04:42.370> actually<00:04:43.000> they

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600

a small zombies map compared to some of

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
the others although maybe not even small

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.950 
the others although maybe not even small
in<00:05:12.039> size<00:05:12.250> on<00:05:12.550> first<00:05:13.030> impressions<00:05:13.539> it<00:05:13.660> doesn't

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
in size on first impressions it doesn't

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.659 
in size on first impressions it doesn't
seem<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.139> complex<00:05:14.949> compared<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.430> what<00:05:15.550> we're

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
seem that complex compared to what we're

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.279 
seem that complex compared to what we're
used<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:15.910> but<00:05:16.090> who<00:05:16.300> knows<00:05:16.539> there<00:05:16.960> might<00:05:17.110> be<00:05:17.169> a

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
used to but who knows there might be a

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.260 
used to but who knows there might be a
ton<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.710> hidden<00:05:18.099> easter<00:05:18.310> eggs<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:18.910> things<00:05:19.060> to

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
ton of hidden easter eggs and things to

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.969 
ton of hidden easter eggs and things to
do<00:05:19.419> in<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.990> map<00:05:20.169> so<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.380> think<00:05:20.470> I've<00:05:20.770> gone<00:05:20.919> over

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
do in the map so I think I've gone over

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.610 
do in the map so I think I've gone over
most<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.120> important<00:05:22.630> essential<00:05:23.199> stuff

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
start off obviously the more in depth

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.230
