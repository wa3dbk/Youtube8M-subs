00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
I want to make sure that you're getting

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.650 
I want to make sure that you're getting
a<00:00:29.820> lock<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.630> usually<00:00:31.199> around<00:00:32.120> $60<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.329> more

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
a lock that's usually around $60 or more

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.510 
a lock that's usually around $60 or more
and<00:00:33.930> basically<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> show

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and basically what that's going to show

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
and basically what that's going to show
is<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> proper<00:00:37.200> security

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is that you have the proper security

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.459 
is that you have the proper security
rating<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> locks<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.260> made<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
rating so all the locks are made out of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
rating so all the locks are made out of
different<00:00:40.680> materials<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
different materials if you get a lot

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.280

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
lock that's too cheap it's gonna be

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
lock that's too cheap it's gonna be
really<00:00:43.530> easy<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.890> break<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> shop

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
really easy to break I'm here the shop

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
really easy to break I'm here the shop
with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> tools<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.860> these

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
with the tools we have some of these

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
with the tools we have some of these
locks<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.789> break<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.809> easily

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
locks it can break really really easily

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.200 
locks it can break really really easily
so<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> make<00:00:49.710> sure<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> lock

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
so to make sure that you get a lock

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.020 
so to make sure that you get a lock
that's<00:00:51.329> $60<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:51.989> more<00:00:52.140> usually<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that's $60 or more usually so this is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
that's $60 or more usually so this is
our<00:00:54.120> most<00:00:54.300> common<00:00:54.600> lock<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> u-lock<00:00:55.980> which

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
our most common lock it's a u-lock which

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.670 
our most common lock it's a u-lock which
are<00:00:56.520> very<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.820> strong<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.989> very<00:00:58.199> big

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
are very very strong it's not very big

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.020 
are very very strong it's not very big
the<00:00:58.920> bigger<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.579> locks<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the bigger that you go in locks the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
the bigger that you go in locks the
lower<00:01:00.210> security<00:01:00.510> rating<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.199> because

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
lower security rating they get because

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.170 
lower security rating they get because
it's<00:01:01.680> easier<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> crowbar<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's easier to put like a crowbar in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.539 
it's easier to put like a crowbar in
there<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> carjack<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
there or like a carjack some of that and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.539 
there or like a carjack some of that and
break<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:05.970> open<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.200> let<00:01:07.560> me<00:01:07.650> demonstrate

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
break them open so let me demonstrate

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.980 
break them open so let me demonstrate
how<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> works<00:01:09.390> real<00:01:09.570> quick<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
how that works real quick on this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330 
how that works real quick on this
bicycle<00:01:10.290> legally<00:01:10.890> you're<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.100> supposed<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
posts and things like that but a lot of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
posts and things like that but a lot of
times<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.159> any<00:01:17.369> other<00:01:17.520> option<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
times you don't have any other option so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
has something at the top of it so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880

back triangle on your bicycle and you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.740 
back triangle on your bicycle and you
can<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.670> through<00:02:05.939> make<00:02:06.360> sure<00:02:06.479> you're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
can actually go through make sure you're

can actually go through make sure you're
attaching<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> actual<00:02:08.009> rack<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> go

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
attaching to the actual rack and go

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.630 
attaching to the actual rack and go
through<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.599> attach<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> wheel<00:02:10.739> attached

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
through and attach to the wheel attached

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.370 
through and attach to the wheel attached
to<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> actual<00:02:12.450> rim

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to the actual rim

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.630 
to the actual rim
and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:13.920> put<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> cable<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:16.400> make<00:02:17.400> sure<00:02:17.430> it's

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
get a nice tug make sure it's a lock

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
get a nice tug make sure it's a lock
securely<00:02:21.660> basically<00:02:22.350> what<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.500> does<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
securely basically what that does is it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.740 
securely basically what that does is it
locks<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.580> back<00:02:23.850> wheel<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.540> lock

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
locks your back wheel with the you lock

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.560 
locks your back wheel with the you lock
and<00:02:24.990> your<00:02:25.320> frame<00:02:25.590> because<00:02:26.280> even<00:02:26.850> if<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.000> even

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
and your frame because even if you even

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.350 
and your frame because even if you even
you<00:02:27.990> took<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> wheel<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:30.000> can't<00:02:30.240> get

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you took the wheel off it can't get

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.940 
you took the wheel off it can't get
outside<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.720> frame<00:02:30.960> because<00:02:31.350> you're<00:02:31.620> inside

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
outside the frame because you're inside

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.320 
outside the frame because you're inside
of<00:02:31.980> triangle<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.850> nice<00:02:32.940> way<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> lock

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
of triangle so it's a nice way to lock

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.440 
of triangle so it's a nice way to lock
it<00:02:33.480> up<00:02:33.540> or<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.790> you're<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.150> if

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
people get these pinhead locks basically

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.640
