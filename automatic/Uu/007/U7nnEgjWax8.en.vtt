can<00:01:57.149> add<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
can add a bit more if you like at this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.850 
can add a bit more if you like at this
stage<00:01:58.560> maybe<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.549> half<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.000> cup<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.860> well

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
stage maybe just a half a cup now well

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.020 
stage maybe just a half a cup now well
basically<00:02:02.159> we're<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> leave<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
basically we're just going to leave this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789 
basically we're just going to leave this
to<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> similar<00:02:03.719> way<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.079> cook<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.409> until<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
to a similar way and cook this until the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.039 
to a similar way and cook this until the
pasta<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.399> done<00:02:06.000> until<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> passes<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.840> then

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
pasta is done until the passes are then

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.180 
pasta is done until the passes are then
take<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.680> normally<00:02:07.829> eat<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:11.129> it

take as you would normally eat it so it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
take as you would normally eat it so it
will<00:02:11.310> pop<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> bit<00:02:11.730> more<00:02:11.879> water<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.239> here<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
will pop a bit more water in here so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.000 
will pop a bit more water in here so
