00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.340 
do before you start brushing your teeth
or<00:01:56.390> taking<00:01:56.660> care<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.869> them<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.140> you're<00:01:57.259> going

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
or taking care of them is you're going

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.040 
or taking care of them is you're going
to<00:01:57.410> do<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> little<00:01:57.890> salt<00:01:58.190> water<00:01:58.460> rinse<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:02.050> need

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
to do a little salt water rinse so need

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.999 
to do a little salt water rinse so need
a<00:02:03.080> couple<00:02:03.320> more<00:02:03.470> hands

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
a couple more hands

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.130 
a couple more hands
there's<00:02:04.520> your<00:02:04.700> saltwater<00:02:05.000> solution

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

and<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:11.830> first<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.370> take<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> swig

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.340 

and<00:02:19.160> then<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.490> spit<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.960> can<00:02:24.080> scrape

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
and then you spit then you can scrape

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.810 
and then you spit then you can scrape
your<00:02:24.530> tongue<00:02:24.770> because<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.220> tongue<00:02:25.430> has<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> lot

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
your tongue because the tongue has a lot

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.390 
your tongue because the tongue has a lot
of<00:02:25.910> bacteria<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.290> easy

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
of bacteria on it and it's just so easy

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.440 
of bacteria on it and it's just so easy
find<00:02:28.400> one<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.550> these<00:02:28.670> other<00:02:28.820> health<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.150> store

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
find one of these other health and store

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.470 
find one of these other health and store
and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.520> scrape<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.580> tongue<00:02:31.910> rinse

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and then just scrape the tongue rinse

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.700 
and then just scrape the tongue rinse
that<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:35.510> next<00:02:35.900> we<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.170> start<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
that and then next we can start the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.620 
that and then next we can start the
brushing<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.610> love<00:02:37.910> using<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.450> these

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
brushing so what I love using is these

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.590 
brushing so what I love using is these
ionic<00:02:38.960> toothbrushes<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.360> they're<00:02:41.360> just

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
ionic toothbrushes and they're just

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.930 
ionic toothbrushes and they're just
worked<00:02:41.840> by<00:02:41.990> solar<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:42.800> either<00:02:42.980> by<00:02:43.190> sunlight<00:02:43.700> or

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
worked by solar so either by sunlight or

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.180 
worked by solar so either by sunlight or
a<00:02:43.970> light<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.660> that's<00:02:45.260> how<00:02:45.410> they're<00:02:45.530> activated

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
a light and that's how they're activated

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.370 
a light and that's how they're activated
and<00:02:46.340> what<00:02:46.460> they<00:02:46.610> do<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.510> allow<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and what they do is they allow the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.830 
and what they do is they allow the
saliva<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.190> become<00:02:49.550> ionic<00:02:50.270> with<00:02:50.480> negative

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
saliva to become ionic with negative

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.290 
saliva to become ionic with negative
ions<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.670> alkalinize<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.970> saliva

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
ions and that alkalinize is the saliva

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.970 
ions and that alkalinize is the saliva
and<00:02:53.570> that's<00:02:53.780> already<00:02:54.290> taken<00:02:54.560> care<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.770> about

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
and that's already taken care of about

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.910 
and that's already taken care of about
40<00:02:55.430> percent<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.850> plaque<00:02:56.500> then<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.530> love

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
40 percent of the plaque then I love

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040 
40 percent of the plaque then I love
using<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.340> neem<00:02:58.550> enamel<00:02:59.030> Iser<00:02:59.210> needs<00:02:59.660> very

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
using the neem enamel Iser needs very

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.890 
using the neem enamel Iser needs very
act<00:03:00.670> antifungal<00:03:01.670> antibacterial<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.780> you

just put the tiniest amount on there and
you<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.320> chip<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.700> little<00:03:07.790> bit<00:03:08.060> comes

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
you just chip it and a little bit comes

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.440 
you just chip it and a little bit comes
out<00:03:10.450> what<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.570> can<00:03:11.780> add<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:14.300> make

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
pressure and very slowly and it's always

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.390 
pressure and very slowly and it's always
gum<00:03:50.849> toward<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.989> teeth<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:53.099> bottom

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
gum toward the teeth so on the bottom

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.309 
gum toward the teeth so on the bottom
it's<00:03:53.519> gum<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.329> on<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.540> top<00:03:54.749> it's<00:03:54.959> gum<00:03:55.109> down

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
it's gum up and on the top it's gum down

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.959 
it's gum up and on the top it's gum down
and<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.919> just<00:03:55.950> go<00:03:56.189> like<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.549> they're

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:56.969 
and you just go like that and they're

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.140 
and you just go like that and they're
brushing<00:03:58.159> pretty<00:03:59.159> much<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.639> that<00:03:59.669> slowly

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
brushing pretty much like that slowly

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.170 
brushing pretty much like that slowly
under<00:04:00.930> getting<00:04:01.109> all<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.530> areas<00:04:01.949> so<00:04:02.819> this<00:04:02.969> goes

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
under getting all the areas so this goes

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.030 
under getting all the areas so this goes
around<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.689> this<00:04:03.750> ionizes<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.530> saliva

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
around and this ionizes the saliva

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.729 
around and this ionizes the saliva
that's<00:04:05.400> doing<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.699> lot<00:04:05.879> of<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.060> work<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:06.480> you

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.070 
very clean what you would notice after a
month<00:04:57.580> is<00:04:57.729> if<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:57.940> lift<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.270> up<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.510> area<00:04:58.840> rug

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
month is if you lift it up that area rug

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.689 
month is if you lift it up that area rug
there'd<00:04:59.290> be<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.410> whole<00:04:59.770> bunch<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.160> debris<00:05:00.550> in

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
there'd be a whole bunch of debris in

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.120 
there'd be a whole bunch of debris in
there<00:05:00.880> so<00:05:01.630> what<00:05:02.080> we<00:05:02.260> do<00:05:02.440> when<00:05:02.590> we<00:05:02.710> take<00:05:02.889> care<00:05:03.070> of

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
there so what we do when we take care of

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.800 
there so what we do when we take care of
the<00:05:03.310> joint<00:05:03.639> of<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:03.940> gum<00:05:04.150> line<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.600> teeth

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
the joint of the gum line and the teeth

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.810 
the joint of the gum line and the teeth
that's<00:05:05.350> how<00:05:05.530> we<00:05:05.590> allow<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:05.919> debris<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.639> not

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
that's how we allow that debris to not

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.060 
that's how we allow that debris to not
build<00:05:07.150> up<00:05:07.389> because<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.289> actually<00:05:08.710> pushes

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
build up because that actually pushes

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.580 
build up because that actually pushes
the<00:05:09.220> gums<00:05:09.460> away<00:05:10.060> from<00:05:10.389> it<00:05:10.539> from<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:10.960> chief<00:05:11.380> and

the gums away from it from the chief and

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.430 
the gums away from it from the chief and
then<00:05:12.100> you<00:05:12.250> just<00:05:12.430> go<00:05:12.550> over<00:05:12.760> each<00:05:13.060> tooth<00:05:13.440> each

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
then you just go over each tooth each

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.920 
then you just go over each tooth each
gum<00:05:14.830> line<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:16.300> follow<00:05:16.600> along

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
gum line like that and you follow along

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.600 
gum line like that and you follow along

like<00:05:57.730> you<00:05:57.850> normally<00:05:58.060> would<00:05:58.330> up<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:58.960> around

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
like you normally would up and around

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.700 
like you normally would up and around
each<00:05:59.950> tooth<00:06:00.250> so<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.360> key<00:06:01.570> here<00:06:01.600> is<00:06:02.020> doing<00:06:02.440> it

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
each tooth so the key here is doing it

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.740 
each tooth so the key here is doing it
and<00:06:02.920> then<00:06:03.100> doing<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.490> again<00:06:03.550> because<00:06:04.480> when<00:06:04.630> you

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
and then doing it again because when you

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.900 
and then doing it again because when you
do<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.140> second<00:06:05.620> time<00:06:05.680> you<00:06:06.130> will<00:06:06.310> see<00:06:06.580> why

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
do it the second time you will see why

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.510 
do it the second time you will see why
you're<00:06:07.120> doing<00:06:07.360> it<00:06:07.420> again<00:06:08.220> so<00:06:09.220> that's<00:06:09.340> the

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
you're doing it again so that's the

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.780 
you're doing it again so that's the
flossing<00:06:09.790> stage<00:06:10.270> it's<00:06:10.600> very<00:06:10.840> key<00:06:11.170> and<00:06:11.790> then

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
flossing stage it's very key and then

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.780 
flossing stage it's very key and then
the<00:06:12.940> next<00:06:13.270> stage<00:06:13.510> is<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:13.870> polishing<00:06:14.590> stage<00:06:14.890> so

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
the next stage is the polishing stage so

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.880 
the next stage is the polishing stage so
for<00:06:16.630> this<00:06:16.750> it's<00:06:16.960> good<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.260> exfoliate<00:06:17.500> the

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
for this it's good to exfoliate the

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.890 
for this it's good to exfoliate the
teeth<00:06:18.190> in<00:06:18.370> a<00:06:18.460> while<00:06:18.640> beyond<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.210> brushing<00:06:19.690> and

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
teeth in a while beyond the brushing and

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.990 
teeth in a while beyond the brushing and
I<00:06:20.620> used<00:06:20.920> to<00:06:21.010> think<00:06:21.130> I<00:06:21.280> was<00:06:21.400> a<00:06:21.430> little<00:06:21.490> too<00:06:21.790> zen

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
I used to think I was a little too zen

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.580 
I used to think I was a little too zen
for<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.300> electric<00:06:22.660> toothbrush<00:06:23.080> but<00:06:23.380> what<00:06:23.560> I

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
for the electric toothbrush but what I

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.860 
for the electric toothbrush but what I
found<00:06:23.890> is<00:06:24.100> I<00:06:24.220> really<00:06:24.550> enjoy<00:06:24.850> them<00:06:25.120> but<00:06:25.630> what<00:06:25.840> I

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
found is I really enjoy them but what I

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.540 
found is I really enjoy them but what I
do<00:06:25.990> with<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:26.590> electric<00:06:26.920> toothbrushes<00:06:27.460> I

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
do with the electric toothbrushes I

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.490 
do with the electric toothbrushes I
avoid<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.000> gum<00:06:28.240> line<00:06:28.480> because<00:06:28.840> those<00:06:29.200> really

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
avoid the gum line because those really

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.740 
avoid the gum line because those really
need<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:29.800> one<00:06:30.100> direction<00:06:30.340> but<00:06:31.240> what<00:06:31.390> this<00:06:31.570> is

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
need that one direction but what this is

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.510 
need that one direction but what this is
good<00:06:31.960> for<00:06:32.170> is<00:06:32.380> giving<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.830> tooth<00:06:33.040> a<00:06:33.220> really

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
good for is giving the tooth a really

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.730
