which become the mechanism of the popper
the<00:00:31.230> edges<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.250> vanilla<00:00:32.669> card<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the edges of the vanilla card so that it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.130 
the edges of the vanilla card so that it
would<00:00:34.350> fit<00:00:34.649> inside<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.910> blue<00:00:36.149> by<00:00:36.390> youth<00:00:36.719> outer

then<00:01:03.600> i<00:01:03.719> sponged<00:01:04.229> around<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> sponge

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.050 

make<00:01:17.090> sure<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:17.840> sponge<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.890> step<00:01:19.490> bit

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
make sure that you sponge the step bit

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.240

so<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:20.840> when<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:21.200> stick<00:01:21.469> your<00:01:21.590> trees<00:01:21.890> on<00:01:22.100> you

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
so that when you stick your trees on you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.410 
so that when you stick your trees on you
can<00:01:22.430> see<00:01:22.700> something<00:01:23.149> in<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.539> background<00:01:25.420> then

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420
