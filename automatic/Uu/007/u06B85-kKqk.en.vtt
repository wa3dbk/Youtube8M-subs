00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:15.259
 the man who lives in several fly 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.259
 you 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.560
 you 'll show us how you got it 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.650
 pick up also with a tool I 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:48.910
 am with a smith really there 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:51.710
 and you are with what you call it 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:58.160
 is called a ketch or marie lise ketchum 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:02.210
 release weird names of the name of his 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.960
 inventor I imagine then how that 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.080
 walk thank you makes me see wade son 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.280
 there no, that's it and then you 'll push 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.990
 come to the tip 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.250
 1 but tell me you did not even touch 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.530
 the fish that will be almost at a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.119
 catch while he is giving this wonderful 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:31.570
 and deadly tools so ketchup staggers 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.780
 okay and you hook the hook in fact 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.810
 we just slip into a film 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.250
 goes back to shame and blow 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.750
 after you have more than exams session 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
 here is a small arm of leverage then but 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.380
 the next to my tool to me there so 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.950
 here you have a smith really there 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.590
 and then a cube breaks so that's 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.570
 the two cd different principle but it 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.790
 works you actually slide 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 the son on and then that helps 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.200
 pick up the fish without touching it 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.150
 what is it that people who his 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.920
 fruits still in the mesh of the stuff 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.920
 that she has lived since your mouth 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 validity police her if it's next 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.040
 applied to push sees the nickel light 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.670
 to be very practical 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.569
 so you hesitate to touch the fish 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.849
 and suddenly you see the leashes 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.510
 directly in it and you can leave 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.430
 divide 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.430
 you will not have a little oxygen the fight 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.140
 here 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.090
 you see it's better than taking it out 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.820
 the limit the big ones are going to us them 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.810
 photographs but the little ones you 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.810
 let's go
