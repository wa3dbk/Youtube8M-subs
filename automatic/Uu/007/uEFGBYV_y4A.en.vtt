00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 it's dry away from laziness and shot 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.309
 then you need to grab an armed hand and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.139
 perform reception or knock out a gun 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.630
 here we are throwing a brush lever 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.219
 seizing his hand with both hands we 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 take the gun to the side 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 the gun is only dangerous when directed 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.500
 on you and not at all dangerous when 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.500
 parallel to your body 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.310
 by no means taking a gun 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
 instruct him on the opponent throw it away 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 or better use it as a shock 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 weapon because you don't know this 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 a gun can he gas or something 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 maybe he charged idle 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 or even without patrons there is a cartridge in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.070
 trunk or not you do not know something and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 it takes time to figure it out 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 so leaving him on the opponent you 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.870
 may be disadvantageous and dangerous 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.870
 position 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.150
 here the enemy threatens you with a pistol 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.869
 behind you raise your hands and start 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.270
 act 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.040
 care whether or not shot capture throw 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.770
 disarming and finishing off to work 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.299
 tricks you can use 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.100
 pistol and shooting plastic 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.220
 balls with their help you can 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.140
 have time to establish or not ear if not 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.520
 shots however when working with such 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.789
 weapons follow safety procedures 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.530
 and point the gun in the face of all the reception 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.319

 protective vest 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.490
 which is used in martial arts and 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.380
 safety glasses do not forget also that 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.390
 here your partner holds a finger on 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 trigger and not to break it 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 restrict the development of care from lazy 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.840
 shot or take reception without 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.350
