some gel cushioning in the back for
added<00:00:39.510> comfort<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> little

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
added comfort and it actually a little

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
added comfort and it actually a little
bit<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> arch<00:00:42.090> support<00:00:42.450> too<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> pretty

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bit of arch support too so it's a pretty

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.549 
bit of arch support too so it's a pretty
good<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.460> unit<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> cable<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> very

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
good little unit and the cable is very

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
good little unit and the cable is very
thin<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:46.920> basically<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.789> goes<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> side<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
thin so basically it goes on the side of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
thin so basically it goes on the side of
your<00:00:48.600> shoe<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.620> will<00:00:49.800> ever<00:00:50.250> feel<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
your shoe and you will ever feel it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.529 
your shoe and you will ever feel it
because<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.530> like<00:00:52.530> tape<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.300> great

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
because it's like tape so that's a great

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.910 
because it's like tape so that's a great
feature<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.610> battery<00:00:57.090> packs<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
feature and the battery packs and this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619 
feature and the battery packs and this
is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> battery<00:00:59.340> pack<00:00:59.609> holder<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.449> would

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
is the battery pack holder so this would

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.650 
is the battery pack holder so this would
go<00:01:00.750> around<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:01.140> ankle<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:02.340> inside<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.210> your

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
go around your ankle now inside on your

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.160 
go around your ankle now inside on your
boot<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.350> under<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.280> pants<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.900> your

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
boot or under your pants and your your

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.310 
boot or under your pants and your your
preference<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:09.210> battery<00:01:09.600> pack<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:10.170> go

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
preference and the battery pack would go

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.120 
preference and the battery pack would go
inside<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> little<00:01:11.040> sleeve<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.620 

then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.759> could<00:01:14.880> turn<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.360> off

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.440 

so<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.710> could<00:01:25.890> turn<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.130> on/off<00:01:26.460> switches<00:01:27.330> up

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
there and the power goes in there wasn't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.980 
there and the power goes in there wasn't
here<00:01:33.409> there<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> go

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
here there you go

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.330
