00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.750 

so<00:00:00.630> we're<00:00:00.750> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.930> look<00:00:01.050> at<00:00:01.170> timing<00:00:01.469> and<00:00:01.800> we

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so we're going to look at timing and we

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.190 
so we're going to look at timing and we
can<00:00:02.909> use<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.300> judge<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:03.899> long<00:00:04.020> it's

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
can use that to judge how long it's

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.019 
can use that to judge how long it's
going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.380> take<00:00:04.440> us<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> day's<00:00:05.040> walk<00:00:05.279> one<00:00:05.940> of

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
going to take us for a day's walk one of

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.160 
going to take us for a day's walk one of
the<00:00:06.089> first<00:00:06.270> things<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.540> need<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.049> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
the first things we need to do is to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.200 
the first things we need to do is to
know<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:07.890> many<00:00:07.950> paces<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.580> take<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.910> 100

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
know how many paces we take to 100

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.549 
know how many paces we take to 100
meters<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.719> that's<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.080> another<00:00:10.200> clip

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
meters and that's in another clip

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.290 
meters and that's in another clip
because<00:00:11.099> once<00:00:11.309> we've<00:00:11.490> got<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.059> then

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
because once we've got that we can then

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.089 
because once we've got that we can then
actually<00:00:12.450> pay<00:00:12.719> 200<00:00:13.139> meters<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.500> time<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
actually pay 200 meters and time it and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.880 
actually pay 200 meters and time it and
if<00:00:14.730> we're<00:00:14.910> doing<00:00:15.030> let's<00:00:15.780> say<00:00:15.900> 2<00:00:16.080> minutes<00:00:16.619> for

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
if we're doing let's say 2 minutes for

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.429 
if we're doing let's say 2 minutes for
100<00:00:17.220> meters<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.539> 3<00:00:18.810> kilometers<00:00:19.350> an

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
100 meters then that is 3 kilometers an

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.230 
100 meters then that is 3 kilometers an
hour<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.220> basis<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:20.789> planning

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
hour so that's the basis of our planning

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
hour so that's the basis of our planning
for<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> day<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.470> let's<00:00:22.680> say<00:00:22.800> we're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
for the day so let's say we're going to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.710 
for the day so let's say we're going to
do<00:00:23.130> 15<00:00:23.550> kilometers<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.109> 5<00:00:25.830> hours

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
do 15 kilometers then that is 5 hours

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.910 
do 15 kilometers then that is 5 hours
now<00:00:27.720> let's<00:00:27.990> say<00:00:28.170> we're<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.470> cross<00:00:28.710> some

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
now let's say we're going to cross some

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970 
now let's say we're going to cross some
contour<00:00:29.279> lines<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.849> uphill<00:00:30.000> 60<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.769> add

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
contour lines going uphill 60 and we add

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
contour lines going uphill 60 and we add
a<00:00:32.040> minute<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.669> each<00:00:32.700> contour<00:00:33.120> line<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.450> that's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
a minute for each contour line so that's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.690 
a minute for each contour line so that's
another<00:00:33.930> hour<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.530> 6<00:00:34.770> hours<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> add<00:00:35.550> an

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
another hour so at 6 hours and add an

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
another hour so at 6 hours and add an
hour<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.059> brakes<00:00:36.270> we've<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> seven<00:00:37.140> hour

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
hour for brakes we've got a seven hour

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.650 
hour for brakes we've got a seven hour
journey<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.550> tend<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> subtract<00:00:39.420> time

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
journey we don't tend to subtract time

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
journey we don't tend to subtract time
when<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.079> downhill<00:00:40.320> unless<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.129> very

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
when we go downhill unless it's very

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.240 
when we go downhill unless it's very
steep<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.879> might<00:00:42.059> add<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.690> minute<00:00:43.379> because

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
steep you might add on a minute because

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.590 
steep you might add on a minute because
steep<00:00:44.460> ground<00:00:44.640> often<00:00:44.940> people<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.270> much<00:00:45.450> slower

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
steep ground often people go much slower

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.490 
steep ground often people go much slower
on<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.059> got<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.539> planning

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
on so that's got our planning

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
on so that's got our planning
methodology<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> look

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
methodology and now we're going to look

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
methodology and now we're going to look
in<00:00:51.660> detail<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> map<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.070> where<00:00:53.520> we're

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
in detail at the map it's to where we're

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
in detail at the map it's to where we're
going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.420> use<00:00:54.570> timing<00:00:54.960> on

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
going to go and how we can use timing on

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.069 
going to go and how we can use timing on
our<00:00:55.170> route<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> our<00:00:57.600> journey<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
our route so our journey is going to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.479 
our route so our journey is going to
take<00:00:58.230> us<00:00:58.379> off<00:00:58.500> along<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.859> path<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
take us off along this path and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
take us off along this path and
eventually<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.930> stream<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
eventually over the stream here and and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.729 
eventually over the stream here and and
beyond<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.390> place<00:01:03.660> let's<00:01:04.170> see

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
beyond but in the first place let's see

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109 
beyond but in the first place let's see
how<00:01:04.860> long<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> take<00:01:05.430> us<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> come

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
how long it's going to take us to come

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
how long it's going to take us to come
from<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.020> sceeto<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> where<00:01:08.220> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
from the sceeto here which is where we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210 
from the sceeto here which is where we
stood<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> around<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> path<00:01:10.530> Junction<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
stood and around to the path Junction it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
stood and around to the path Junction it
splits<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.869> ever<00:01:13.200> measure<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
splits here now ever measure that I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
splits here now ever measure that I
reckon<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.760> 300<00:01:15.420> meters<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.960> actually

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
reckon it's about 300 meters I actually

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
reckon it's about 300 meters I actually
walk<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.369> four<00:01:17.640> Kay's<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:18.030> hour<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
walk about four Kay's an hour which is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
walk about four Kay's an hour which is
one<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> half<00:01:19.140> minutes<00:01:19.619> per<00:01:20.340> hundred

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
one and a half minutes per hundred

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
one and a half minutes per hundred
meters<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:22.170> four<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> half

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
meters so that's about four and a half

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.480 
meters so that's about four and a half
minutes<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> honest<00:01:26.070> there's<00:01:26.250> maybe

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
minutes and to be honest there's maybe

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
minutes and to be honest there's maybe
one<00:01:26.700> contour<00:01:27.330> line<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.720> don't<00:01:27.780> think<00:01:28.170> I'll

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
one contour line I don't think I'll

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
one contour line I don't think I'll
really<00:01:28.439> worry<00:01:28.680> about<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.909> four<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
really worry about that so four and a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.219 
really worry about that so four and a
half<00:01:30.240> minutes<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.780> here

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
half minutes from here

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:42.320 
half minutes from here
to<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> junction

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.359 

yep<00:01:43.330> well<00:01:43.600> there<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.869> are<00:01:43.900> there's<00:01:44.200> my<00:01:44.380> 300

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
yep well there we are there's my 300

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.980 
yep well there we are there's my 300
meters<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.180> was<00:01:46.270> about<00:01:46.420> 4<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.840> half

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
meters and I was about 4 and a half

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.070 
meters and I was about 4 and a half
minutes<00:01:47.409> which<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.770> right<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.189> me<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:49.080> pacing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
minutes which is right for me and pacing

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.100 
minutes which is right for me and pacing
and<00:01:50.610> timings<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:51.759> both<00:01:51.970> accurate<00:01:52.479> about<00:01:52.689> 90

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
and timings of both accurate about 90

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.590 
and timings of both accurate about 90
percent<00:01:53.610> there's<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.700> there<00:01:54.909> for<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.090> 10<00:01:55.299> percent

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
percent there's a there for a 10 percent

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.469 
percent there's a there for a 10 percent
error<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.140> if<00:01:57.100> I've<00:01:57.399> gone<00:01:57.549> 300<00:01:58.000> meters<00:01:58.299> 10

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
error and if I've gone 300 meters 10

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.120 
error and if I've gone 300 meters 10
percent<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.899> that<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.200> 30<00:01:59.440> meters<00:01:59.860> so<00:01:59.979> if<00:02:00.070> I

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
percent of that is 30 meters so if I

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.039 
percent of that is 30 meters so if I
really<00:02:00.280> hadn't<00:02:00.580> found<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.909> path<00:02:01.090> here<00:02:01.509> that's

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
really hadn't found the path here that's

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.810 
really hadn't found the path here that's
about<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> sort<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.740> extra<00:02:03.039> distance<00:02:03.399> I'd<00:02:03.640> go

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
about the sort of extra distance I'd go

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.490 
about the sort of extra distance I'd go
so<00:02:04.360> we<00:02:04.479> all<00:02:04.570> have<00:02:04.750> different<00:02:05.049> paces<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
so we all have different paces and

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.590 
so we all have different paces and
different<00:02:05.860> speeds<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.460> we<00:02:07.119> just<00:02:07.299> need<00:02:07.479> to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
different speeds and we just need to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600 
different speeds and we just need to
know<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:07.960> our<00:02:07.990> own<00:02:08.229> individual<00:02:08.769> rate<00:02:09.459> of

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
know what our own individual rate of

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.780 
know what our own individual rate of
movement<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.650> we<00:02:11.650> can<00:02:11.800> also<00:02:11.920> adapt<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.580> in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
movement is we can also adapt this in

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.699 
movement is we can also adapt this in
more<00:02:13.239> difficult<00:02:13.750> terrain<00:02:14.080> like<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> Heather

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
more difficult terrain like the Heather

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.590 
more difficult terrain like the Heather
with<00:02:15.100> experience<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:15.970> get<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.299> know<00:02:16.450> our

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
with experience we get to know our

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.509 
with experience we get to know our
pacing<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.170> our<00:02:17.350> timing<00:02:17.709> through<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.250> sort

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
pacing and our timing through that sort

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.940 
pacing and our timing through that sort
of<00:02:18.640> terrain<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.600> can<00:02:19.750> use<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> GPS<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.560> help<00:02:20.590> you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
of terrain you can use a GPS to help you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.390 
of terrain you can use a GPS to help you
actually<00:02:21.310> work<00:02:21.459> some<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.880> out<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:24.220> also

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
actually work some of that out it's also

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.340 
actually work some of that out it's also
useful<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:24.970> able<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.180> take<00:02:25.780> your<00:02:25.959> pacing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350

everybody<00:02:28.299> goes<00:02:28.569> off<00:02:28.720> pretty<00:02:28.930> fast<00:02:29.019> but<00:02:29.860> if

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
everybody goes off pretty fast but if

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.170 
everybody goes off pretty fast but if
someone's<00:02:30.220> got<00:02:30.340> blisters<00:02:30.549> somebody's<00:02:31.060> not

someone's got blisters somebody's not
feeling<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.600> great

you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.470> time<00:02:32.680> how<00:02:32.890> long<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.040> takes<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.430> to

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
you can time how long it takes you to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.330 
you can time how long it takes you to
100<00:02:33.940> meters<00:02:34.239> recalculate<00:02:35.230> your<00:02:35.500> rate<00:02:36.190> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
100 meters recalculate your rate of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.670 
100 meters recalculate your rate of
travel<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.880> then<00:02:37.269> perhaps<00:02:37.480> even<00:02:37.959> change<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
travel and then perhaps even change the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.350 
travel and then perhaps even change the
plan<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> day<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.340> you're<00:02:39.730> back<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:39.910> time

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
plan of the day so you're back in time

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:55.640 
plan of the day so you're back in time
that<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.470> told<00:02:41.680> people<00:02:41.920> you'd<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.340> back<00:02:42.519> for

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:08.309 

you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.960 

you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.160 

okay<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.030> we've<00:03:19.360> arrived<00:03:19.660> at<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> junction

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
okay so we've arrived at the junction

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.890 
okay so we've arrived at the junction
now<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.560> what<00:03:21.490> we<00:03:21.610> can<00:03:21.850> do<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.240> can<00:03:22.420> confirm

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
now and what we can do is we can confirm

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.530 
now and what we can do is we can confirm
which<00:03:23.620> path<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.130> which<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.700> that's<00:03:25.180> normally

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
which path is which and that's normally

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.270 
which path is which and that's normally
done<00:03:25.600> simply<00:03:26.110> by<00:03:26.260> setting<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.830> map<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.250> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
done simply by setting the map so you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.090 
done simply by setting the map so you
set<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.520> map<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.960> the<00:03:29.830> we

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
set the map and as you do that the we

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.320 
set the map and as you do that the we
end<00:03:30.250> up<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.580> red<00:03:30.730> end<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.000> needle<00:03:31.120> on

and what we can then do is take a
bearing<00:03:50.290> along<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.400> path<00:03:51.610> we<00:03:51.850> want<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.300> the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
bearing along the path we want on the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.720 
bearing along the path we want on the
map<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.930> then<00:03:53.560> actually<00:03:53.950> using<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.340> compass

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
map and then actually using the compass

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.430 
map and then actually using the compass
put<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.090> bearing<00:03:55.450> onto<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.810> ground<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.260> see

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
put that bearing onto the ground to see

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.000 
put that bearing onto the ground to see
which<00:03:56.650> path<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.250> best<00:03:57.430> fit<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.860> take

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
which path is the best fit so I can take

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.430 
which path is the best fit so I can take
a<00:04:00.070> bearing<00:04:00.340> along<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.030> path<00:04:01.270> on<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.870> map<00:04:02.050> here

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
a bearing along the path on the map here

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.530 
a bearing along the path on the map here
so<00:04:02.680> that's<00:04:03.460> path<00:04:03.700> we<00:04:03.940> think<00:04:04.180> we<00:04:04.240> want<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.480> go

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
so that's path we think we want to go

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.200 
so that's path we think we want to go
along<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.440> can<00:04:05.590> check<00:04:05.740> that<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.760> used<00:04:07.060> in

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
along so you can check that so I used in

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.820 
along so you can check that so I used in
a<00:04:07.240> line<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.720> think<00:04:07.990> it's<00:04:08.080> a<00:04:08.110> bit<00:04:08.230> clearer<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.650> see

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
a line I think it's a bit clearer to see

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.760 
a line I think it's a bit clearer to see
than<00:04:09.040> using<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.970> edge<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.900> millimeter

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
than using the edge the millimeter

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.550 
than using the edge the millimeter
markings<00:04:12.640> kind<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.030> obscure<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.600> so<00:04:14.380> if<00:04:14.470> I

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
markings kind of obscure that so if I

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.080 
markings kind of obscure that so if I
put<00:04:14.710> that<00:04:14.740> there<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.430> then<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.760> turned

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
put that there and then I just turned

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.680 
put that there and then I just turned
the<00:04:16.209> dial<00:04:16.650> until<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.549> lines<00:04:18.850> in<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.209> capsule

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
the dial until the lines in the capsule

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.510 
the dial until the lines in the capsule
line<00:04:20.170> up<00:04:20.380> with<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.650> north/south<00:04:21.070> grid<00:04:21.190> lines

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
line up with the north/south grid lines

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.430 
line up with the north/south grid lines
on<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.820> map<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.450> once<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.720> have<00:04:22.870> my<00:04:22.900> bearing

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
on the map so once I have my bearing

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.690 
on the map so once I have my bearing
I've<00:04:23.620> got<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:23.980> get<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.220> red<00:04:24.400> end<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.640> the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
I've got to get the red end of the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.790 
I've got to get the red end of the
needle<00:04:24.760> pointing<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.720> end<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.110> just<00:04:26.650> take

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
needle pointing to the end I just take

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.830 
needle pointing to the end I just take
the<00:04:26.920> compass<00:04:27.250> off<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:28.330> need<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.600> get<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
the compass off and I need to get the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.230 
the compass off and I need to get the
compass<00:04:29.200> like<00:04:29.920> a<00:04:29.950> coming<00:04:30.790> straight<00:04:31.030> out<00:04:31.090> from

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
compass like a coming straight out from

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.970 
compass like a coming straight out from
my<00:04:31.510> chest<00:04:31.780> pointing<00:04:32.140> forward<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:32.560> often

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
my chest pointing forward so often

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.920 
my chest pointing forward so often
holding<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.310> with<00:04:33.370> two<00:04:33.550> hand<00:04:33.760> like<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.180> as<00:04:34.780> I

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
holding it with two hand like that as I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.290 
holding it with two hand like that as I
turn<00:04:35.140> around<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.620> needle<00:04:35.890> comes<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.970> settle

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
turn around the needle comes to settle

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.440 
turn around the needle comes to settle
in<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.950> red<00:04:39.190> arrow<00:04:39.730> on<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.090> bottom<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
in to the red arrow on the bottom of the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.480 
in to the red arrow on the bottom of the
base<00:04:40.600> plate<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:40.960> I'm<00:04:41.890> looking<00:04:42.190> down<00:04:42.340> this

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
base plate and I'm looking down this

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.040 
base plate and I'm looking down this
direction<00:04:42.970> traveller<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:43.660> it's<00:04:43.780> pointing

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
direction traveller and it's pointing

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.020 
direction traveller and it's pointing
straight<00:04:44.200> down<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.919> right-hand<00:04:45.100> path<00:04:45.490> so

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
straight down the right-hand path so

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.840 
straight down the right-hand path so
that's<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.360> one<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.540> want
