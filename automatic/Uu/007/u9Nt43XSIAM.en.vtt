00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.539 
here and working on weight transfers so
the<00:01:58.549> important<00:01:58.939> thing<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.299> as<00:01:59.689> we<00:02:00.549> push

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
the important thing is that as we push

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.069 
the important thing is that as we push
one<00:02:01.790> foot<00:02:02.030> forward<00:02:02.329> in<00:02:02.570> front<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.960> other

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
one foot forward in front of the other

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.810 
one foot forward in front of the other
we<00:02:03.259> get<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.619> weight<00:02:03.829> on<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.130> forward<00:02:04.460> foot<00:02:04.640> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
we get the weight on the forward foot so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.010 
we get the weight on the forward foot so
that's<00:02:04.909> what<00:02:05.119> I'm<00:02:05.180> gonna<00:02:05.299> demonstrate<00:02:05.570> right

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that's what I'm gonna demonstrate right

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:20.660 
that's what I'm gonna demonstrate right
now

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.210 

okay<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:21.750> got<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> weight<00:02:22.200> transfer<00:02:22.380> next

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
okay so we got the weight transfer next

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
okay so we got the weight transfer next
thing<00:02:23.370> that's<00:02:23.490> important<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.120> stopping<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
thing that's important is stopping of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.990 
thing that's important is stopping of
course<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.130> important<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.730> control

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
course it's important to be in control

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
course it's important to be in control
and<00:02:27.420> know<00:02:27.870> how<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.080> slow<00:02:28.260> yourself<00:02:28.380> down<00:02:28.680> when

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and know how to slow yourself down when

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.729 
and know how to slow yourself down when
