00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
hey this robert with sigma3 survival and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.260 
hey this robert with sigma3 survival and
we're<00:00:15.320> down<00:00:15.469> here<00:00:15.500> by<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.070> creek<00:00:16.789> today<00:00:17.060> and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
we're down here by the creek today and

we're down here by the creek today and
i'm<00:00:17.360> going<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:17.539> show<00:00:17.660> y'all<00:00:17.900> how<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:18.110> make<00:00:18.320> a

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
i'm going to show y'all how to make a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.769 
i'm going to show y'all how to make a
gorge<00:00:18.770> hook<00:00:19.099> this<00:00:19.880> is<00:00:20.029> a<00:00:20.090> real<00:00:20.300> simple<00:00:20.539> little

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
gorge hook this is a real simple little

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.440 
gorge hook this is a real simple little
design<00:00:21.259> that<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:22.099> pretty<00:00:22.610> effective<00:00:22.880> at

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
design that is pretty effective at

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.600 
design that is pretty effective at
catching<00:00:24.020> game<00:00:24.380> you're<00:00:25.189> not<00:00:25.310> going<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.520> be

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
catching game you're not going to be

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.460 
catching game you're not going to be
catching<00:00:25.970> as<00:00:26.060> many<00:00:26.090> as<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:26.900> would<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:27.079> let's

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
catching as many as you would on let's

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.260 
catching as many as you would on let's
say<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.680> yo-yo<00:00:27.980> device<00:00:28.520> or<00:00:28.820> something<00:00:29.029> like

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
say a yo-yo device or something like

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.359 
say a yo-yo device or something like
that<00:00:29.480> but<00:00:29.689> they<00:00:29.840> do<00:00:29.899> work<00:00:30.259> especially<00:00:30.890> if<00:00:31.279> you

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
that but they do work especially if you

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.799 
that but they do work especially if you
don't<00:00:31.489> have<00:00:31.610> any<00:00:31.879> modern<00:00:32.270> equipment

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
don't have any modern equipment

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.720 
don't have any modern equipment
basically<00:00:33.559> all<00:00:33.890> you<00:00:34.070> need

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
basically all you need

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.369 
basically all you need
this<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.210> primitive<00:00:35.480> cordage<00:00:36.820> whip<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.059> up

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
this is primitive cordage whip this up

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.010 
this is primitive cordage whip this up
you<00:00:39.379> know<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.710> not<00:00:40.190> too<00:00:40.430> long<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.670> fashion<00:00:41.300> the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
you know and not too long a fashion the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.619 
you know and not too long a fashion the
way<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:42.469> make<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:43.820> find<00:00:44.090> any<00:00:44.300> kind

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
way that you make it you find any kind

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.959 
way that you make it you find any kind
of<00:00:44.780> any<00:00:45.230> kind<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.679> plant<00:00:46.010> fiber<00:00:46.309> that<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:46.789> can

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
of any kind of plant fiber that you can

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.849 
of any kind of plant fiber that you can
extract<00:00:47.179> any<00:00:47.570> kind<00:00:47.809> of<00:00:47.899> cordage<00:00:48.260> from<00:00:48.559> and

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
extract any kind of cordage from and

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.410 
extract any kind of cordage from and
this<00:00:49.249> stuff<00:00:49.489> happens<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.940> just<00:00:50.149> grow<00:00:50.390> right

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
this stuff happens to just grow right

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.569 
this stuff happens to just grow right
down<00:00:50.870> here<00:00:51.140> on<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.409> creek<00:00:51.649> line<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.249> I<00:00:52.309> use

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
down here on the creek line so I use

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.540 
down here on the creek line so I use
that<00:00:53.079> real<00:00:54.079> quick<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.559> whip<00:00:54.710> up<00:00:54.920> some<00:00:55.100> cordage

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
that real quick to whip up some cordage

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.639 
that real quick to whip up some cordage
but<00:00:55.819> any<00:00:56.030> kind<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:56.780> know<00:00:56.809> Elm<00:00:57.229> Hickory

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
but any kind of you know Elm Hickory

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.979 
but any kind of you know Elm Hickory
yucca<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.879> mean<00:00:59.030> there's<00:00:59.179> a<00:00:59.239> million<00:00:59.479> types<00:00:59.780> of

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
yucca I mean there's a million types of

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.020 
yucca I mean there's a million types of
cordage<00:01:00.559> out<00:01:00.710> there<00:01:00.949> anything<00:01:01.249> this<00:01:01.550> fibrous

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
cordage out there anything this fibrous

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.420 
cordage out there anything this fibrous
you<00:01:02.269> can<00:01:02.449> use<00:01:02.690> for<00:01:03.350> something<00:01:03.710> like<00:01:03.889> this<00:01:04.159> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
you can use for something like this and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.300 
you can use for something like this and
you<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.550> basically<00:01:05.380> separate<00:01:06.380> these<00:01:06.680> fibers

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
you just basically separate these fibers

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.820 
you just basically separate these fibers
from<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.970> plant<00:01:08.270> either<00:01:08.930> whether<00:01:09.560> they're

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
from the plant either whether they're

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.170 
from the plant either whether they're
dead<00:01:10.040> or<00:01:10.220> green<00:01:11.290> they'll<00:01:12.290> work<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.670> I'm<00:01:14.000> not

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
dead or green they'll work and I'm not

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.940 
dead or green they'll work and I'm not
going<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.390> do<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.540> whole<00:01:14.750> cordage<00:01:15.200> video<00:01:15.530> here

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to do a whole cordage video here

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:33.610 
going to do a whole cordage video here
because<00:01:16.190> that's<00:01:31.570> with<00:01:32.570> your<00:01:32.720> reel<00:01:33.320> the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
because that's with your reel the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.190 
because that's with your reel the
smaller<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.160> line<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:35.150> better<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:36.020> know<00:01:36.050> for

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
smaller the line the better you know for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.560 
smaller the line the better you know for
catching<00:01:36.830> more<00:01:37.010> so<00:01:37.880> you're<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.330> going<00:01:38.480> to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
catching more so you're just going to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.810 
catching more so you're just going to
kink<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.900> over<00:01:39.440> you're<00:01:39.830> gonna<00:01:39.920> let<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.220> roll

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
kink that over you're gonna let it roll

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.470 
kink that over you're gonna let it roll
on<00:01:41.030> itself<00:01:41.390> pinch<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.230> then<00:01:43.130> roll<00:01:43.370> away

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.500 

and<00:01:47.480> in<00:01:47.960> no<00:01:48.140> time<00:01:48.700> you'll<00:01:49.700> have<00:01:49.910> yourself<00:01:50.150> a

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
and in no time you'll have yourself a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.870 
and in no time you'll have yourself a
usable<00:01:51.410> cordage<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.220> can<00:01:52.370> catch<00:01:52.580> fish

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
usable cordage that you can catch fish

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.600 
usable cordage that you can catch fish
off<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.410> know<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.920> takes<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.280> little<00:01:55.400> while

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
off of you know it takes a little while

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.110 
off of you know it takes a little while
to<00:01:55.670> produce<00:01:55.970> I'm<00:01:56.450> not<00:01:56.570> going<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.780> produce<00:01:56.870> them

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
to produce I'm not going to produce them

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.090 
to produce I'm not going to produce them
another<00:01:59.120> thing<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.690> need<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.960> find<00:02:00.260> you

the hook or the I'm gonna cut that off

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.100 
the hook or the I'm gonna cut that off
but<00:02:20.420> I'm<00:02:20.569> gonna<00:02:20.660> use<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.290> help<00:02:21.410> me

but I'm gonna use that to help me

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.530 
but I'm gonna use that to help me
my<00:02:23.770> my<00:02:24.340> thorn<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.240> what<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
my my thorn and this is what the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.910 
my my thorn and this is what the
finished<00:02:25.720> product<00:02:26.140> will<00:02:26.380> look<00:02:26.500> like

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
finished product will look like

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.620 
finished product will look like
and<00:02:29.220> basically<00:02:30.220> what<00:02:30.400> we're<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
and basically what we're going to do and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.810 
and basically what we're going to do and
when<00:02:34.630> I'm<00:02:34.720> making<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.200> cordage<00:02:35.820> typically

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
when I'm making the cordage typically

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.730 
when I'm making the cordage typically
what<00:02:37.360> I'll<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.930> I'll<00:02:38.080> make<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.470> thinner

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
what I'll do is I'll make it thinner

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.830 
what I'll do is I'll make it thinner
towards<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.430> end<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.790> hook<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.240> I'll

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
towards the end of the hook and I'll

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.230 
towards the end of the hook and I'll
taper<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.530> slightly<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.520> little<00:02:42.820> bit<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
taper up slightly and get a little bit a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.090 
taper up slightly and get a little bit a
little<00:02:43.630> bit<00:02:43.750> larger<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.470> go<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.890> because

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
little bit larger as I go up because

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.770 
little bit larger as I go up because
mainly<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:45.970> need<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.180> thinner<00:02:46.510> line

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
mainly you just need the thinner line

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.480 
mainly you just need the thinner line
towards<00:02:47.380> where<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.590> fish<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:47.920> going<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> be

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
towards where the fish is going to be

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.830 
towards where the fish is going to be
and<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.810> way<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.200> gorge<00:02:50.440> hook<00:02:50.740> works<00:02:51.070> is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
and the way that a gorge hook works is

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.570 
and the way that a gorge hook works is
the<00:02:52.840> fish<00:02:53.050> will<00:02:53.290> swallow<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.950> hole<00:02:54.220> and

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the fish will swallow this hole and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.550 
the fish will swallow this hole and
it'll<00:02:55.000> get<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.270> your<00:02:55.360> throat<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.080> it'll<00:02:56.620> get

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it'll get in your throat and it'll get

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.590 
it'll get in your throat and it'll get
closer<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.070> y'all<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.910> you're

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
closer so that y'all can see this you're

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.360 
closer so that y'all can see this you're
going<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.750> want<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.050> feed<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.650> through<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
going to want to feed this through the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.410 
going to want to feed this through the
bottom<00:03:03.760> roll<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.080> piece<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.620> cord<00:03:05.860> here

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
bottom roll of the piece of cord here

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.630 
bottom roll of the piece of cord here
you<00:03:07.420> want<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.690> work<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.280> work<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.400> about

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
you want to work it work it about

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.270 
you want to work it work it about
halfway<00:03:09.940> down<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.709> want<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.950> go<00:03:12.070> up

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
halfway down and then you want to go up

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.479 
halfway down and then you want to go up
about<00:03:12.430> two<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.000> three<00:03:13.030> threads<00:03:13.630> in<00:03:14.050> your

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
about two to three threads in your

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.900 
about two to three threads in your
cordage<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:16.110> poke<00:03:17.110> poke<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.250> needle<00:03:18.280> through

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
cordage and poke poke the needle through

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.080 
cordage and poke poke the needle through
and<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:20.560> going<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.770> wrap<00:03:21.010> over<00:03:21.430> itself<00:03:21.760> like

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
and it's going to wrap over itself like

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.810 
and it's going to wrap over itself like
this<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:24.510> what<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.540> do<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.989> I'll<00:03:26.140> feed<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:30.549> end

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
this so what I do is I'll feed the end

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:42.289 
this so what I do is I'll feed the end
of<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.209> over<00:03:32.019> these<00:03:32.170> two<00:03:32.410> little<00:03:32.709> notches

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.360 

I'll<00:03:43.299> set<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.630> over<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.709> then<00:03:44.950> pull<00:03:45.220> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
I'll set it over that and then pull the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.789 
I'll set it over that and then pull the
cord<00:03:45.640> back<00:03:45.910> tight<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:47.080> basically<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.680> way

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
cord back tight and basically the way

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.280 
cord back tight and basically the way
this<00:03:47.980> works<00:03:48.310> is<00:03:48.610> I'll<00:03:49.090> put<00:03:49.299> my<00:03:49.480> bait<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:50.170> know

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
this works is I'll put my bait you know

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.460 
this works is I'll put my bait you know
I'll<00:03:50.500> take<00:03:50.880> worm<00:03:51.880> or<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.329> big<00:03:52.540> grub<00:03:52.840> larva<00:03:53.320> would

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
I'll take worm or a big grub larva would

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.949 
I'll take worm or a big grub larva would
be<00:03:53.560> perfect<00:03:54.070> for<00:03:54.130> this<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.450> way<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.750> fish

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
be perfect for this and the way the fish

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.190 
be perfect for this and the way the fish
will<00:03:56.680> bite<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.579> he'll<00:03:57.910> come<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.570> he'll

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
will bite it is he'll come in and he'll

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.110 
will bite it is he'll come in and he'll
swallow<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.860> like<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.579> it'll<00:04:00.670> go<00:04:00.880> down

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
swallow it like this and it'll go down

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.509 
swallow it like this and it'll go down
his<00:04:01.329> throat<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:02.470> when<00:04:02.680> he<00:04:02.829> tries<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.310> pull

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
his throat but when he tries to pull

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.750 
his throat but when he tries to pull
away<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.209> hook<00:04:05.170> will<00:04:05.380> turn<00:04:05.590> sideways<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.579> his

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
away the hook will turn sideways in his

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.640 
away the hook will turn sideways in his
throat<00:04:07.120> now<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.390> can<00:04:07.720> set<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.079> rope<00:04:08.290> either

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
throat now you can set the rope either

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.949 
throat now you can set the rope either
at<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.040> bottom<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.610> hook<00:04:09.790> or<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.540> can<00:04:10.720> set

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
at the bottom of the hook or you can set

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.449 
at the bottom of the hook or you can set
it<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.260> middle<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.709> hook<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.100> doesn't

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
it in the middle of the hook it doesn't

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.910 
it in the middle of the hook it doesn't
really<00:04:12.610> matter<00:04:12.910> either<00:04:13.750> method<00:04:14.290> works<00:04:14.530> but

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
really matter either method works but

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.800 
really matter either method works but
further<00:04:15.220> when<00:04:15.910> you've<00:04:16.030> got<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> sharpened

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
further when you've got a sharpened

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.420 
further when you've got a sharpened
Gorge<00:04:17.049> hook<00:04:17.320> like<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:17.620> it's<00:04:18.040> more<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.400> a

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
Gorge hook like this it's more like a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.350 
Gorge hook like this it's more like a
hook<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.510> want<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.780> do<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.079> method<00:04:21.360> so

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
hook then you want to do this method so

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.000 
hook then you want to do this method so
it<00:04:22.540> sits<00:04:22.780> up<00:04:22.990> like<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.410> most<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:23.950> time

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
it sits up like this most of the time

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.830
