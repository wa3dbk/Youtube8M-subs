00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
today's internet savvy consumer

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.749 
today's internet savvy consumer
industries<00:01:48.649> come<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.859> long<00:01:49.039> way<00:01:49.219> in<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.399> decade

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
industries come a long way in a decade

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.429 
industries come a long way in a decade
we<00:01:49.969> used<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.240> ask<00:01:50.390> should<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:50.990> have<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.170> website

we used to ask should I have a website
if<00:01:52.100> i<00:01:52.189> do<00:01:52.250> should<00:01:52.549> i<00:01:52.670> put<00:01:52.880> photos<00:01:53.240> on

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
if i do should i put photos on

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.510 
if i do should i put photos on
highlights<00:01:53.930> what<00:01:54.560> about<00:01:54.770> price<00:01:55.039> should<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.399> be

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
highlights what about price should it be

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.099 
highlights what about price should it be
on<00:01:55.640> there<00:01:55.850> shouldn't<00:01:56.299> it<00:01:56.359> how<00:01:56.509> should<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.840> price

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
so we've come a long way there's no

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:00.999 
so we've come a long way there's no
