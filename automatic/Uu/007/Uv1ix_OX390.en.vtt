 he wanted and that benefits everyone is possible antonio as author as 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.600
 artist in principle do not know what he thinks of the disappointed nonsmokers 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.830
 they have to rethink many things because it is to invest name the musician who 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.990
 himself as the agreement with 120 days 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.529
 this century I'm sorry they did not want to quit the fight but we do not have the 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.970
 glass half full or half empty 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.699
 it's simply that the worker that we feel unprecedented that we meet 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.980
 to discuss anything of this kind is to say at the end we are 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.120
 the culprits of this story and obviously yes but I am not and I will be 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.070
 that is not lavished in Spain are coming to think that the solution is 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.040
 in that the whole market in this case for example where I can talk more 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.330
 big closest to the music market in all this 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.880
 must go down in conference in these changes we are fine at this time it 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.449
 is moving from time to time to change the business 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.969
 and they have to lower the prices and not eight part in the barrel negotiated as 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.980
 pig who must do or not of all life has been like that 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.689
 with the means that right now we are leaving him with his ass in the air 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.680
 the big smaller companies have to change the ship wanted to know 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.289
 what is the real espaÃ±a is difficult and they no longer know where 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.670
 alluding to the one I do gives me back I had thrown a hard daily journey 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.670
 nobody talks about that during the day I refer to the big companies 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.970
 ee really an artist the meno 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.060
 a ctc protected others of the songs equal 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.579
 maybe the music market has to change but it's because there's 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.210
 here I am I insist we are in a world that evolves very fast i all 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140
 we have to evolve percent what we do television 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.060
 efe internet is a friend of television for many good 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 I had less than one internet program 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.440
 because I think that with freezer a new possibility to do things 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.759
 different I think you have to work on finding solutions and what posts 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.630
 protect the culture in this way I prefer that vetoed 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.770
 they cover me well 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 and that we pay for it as a public good that we have to protect from not charging 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.170
 an arbitrary shape like mushrooms 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.439
 when he has nothing to do at all to do especially 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.430
 the next debate better we will not talk to you 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.450
 for you 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.450
 and for you even in the rest 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.219
 While 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.269
 min 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.399
 one of those 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.399
 do not 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.439
