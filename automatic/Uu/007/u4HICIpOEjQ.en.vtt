00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.000
 shows you iphone5 that has arrived with the 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.730
 following dies telephone has been 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.640
 changed already display but still does not give 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.700
 light the image we reach to see the 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.410
 background is reached to try to see though 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.200
 these costumes a little harder 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.450
 can see backlight 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.320
 but we know it's on because 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.320
 touch 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.029
 interface with us and also when 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.530
 we lower the silence the phone vibrates 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.720
 this tells us that the phone is 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.970
 turned on normally but has a 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.220
 it fails in the display already when we 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.129
 we uncover and look at what the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.350
 fails we have found that the track the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.019
 has damaged 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.809
 has a tab on the connector of the 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.489
 display and can be observed in the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.370
 third track down 1 2 3 is pisaca 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.890
 strange 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.500
 and it's totally started where I live 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 but here by following the path to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 track comes to be is like a coil 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.180
 what's here and that's where we're going to do 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 the bridge we have to do the following 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.560
 we have to bridge the connector 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.560
 of the display something similar to this 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.570
 here to track 3 of the display for later 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.340
 I'll give it to the time in the urine that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.750
 is commenting then we are going to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.760
 look what we are going to do 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.010
 and then we can see the magnitude of 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.990
 case let's make a small 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.990
 approach so they can try to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.050
 look at the track what happened there 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.100
 we see the pizza that is totally 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.740
 shattered 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 is that the one that year and there we see the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.330
 there we reach to see the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.640
 road that arrives until today not that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.190
 is there the coil is here 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.930
 this and we are going to release the cable here is 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.620
 today not the display we are going to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.360
 to come back here to leave everything normal because 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.770
 we have to work on the display first 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.770
 to then make the jumper here 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.830
 let's apply a little light on 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.580
 the pizza 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.130
 but the pizza that needs more the jumper 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.840
 only a little bit we already have the wire 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 damaged at the tip to adhere to there 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.959
 base 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.959
 of the display connector 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.410
 we just put it up there and what 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.740
 we play very softly 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.560
 without going to touch the plastic part since 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.570
 fixed but I want to leave more more 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 elegant there we see that it has been 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.840
 well fixed and now only missing then 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.800
 bring it here to the the wire 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.800
 to the coil 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.720
 we already have a soldier then the cable 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.200
 side and we do not just connect and 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 we try 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.319
 there we see the phone calling image 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.319
 perfectly there is showing the logo 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.499
 after we made the jumper to the 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.200
 track and so we can repair any 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.269
 fails in that it is one or two 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.069
 clues to not have to change the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.540
 connector in case we do not have practice 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.280
 although you can also change connector 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.069
 but here it would not do to change the 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.819
 connector because it turns out that the fault is 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.709
 because it was a track internally 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.389
