00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.770

 luckily there they are yes you have to 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.190
 make a job well I think so 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.350
 important is that you are a little firm 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.360
 in your shoes you have a correct 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.850
 kind of stress situations or just in 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.650
 where there is a lot of brewers you just have to 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.760
 your thing can do yes know the first time 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.840
 you actually don't either 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.930
 exactly how you react 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.000
 I know it has a strong stomach and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.709
 that I did n't come across the bridge blood 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.660
 But it's not just blood in it 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.400
 we try this course in the first place 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.420
 always trainees and people who work for the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.580
 walk for the first time 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.410
 try to protect something especially because 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.709
 they are not exposed to immediately 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.540
 of everything you see sometimes then then 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.510
 then you experience things that you think of 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.340
 yeah well i sure kids you know 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.530
 well I could have known me too 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.930
 we are owning them 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.060
 accommodates in a bot team and these are the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.010
 record colleagues from the shop floor and those 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 be turned on at actually from too 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.720
 stuck to incidents such as something with 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.820
 if something happens in the colleague or with there 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.420
 children where things don't end well 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.610
 And then talk yes that's just that helps 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.660
 I just think it is incredibly beautiful to wear 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.040
 helping people 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.780
 so because it's not just people who 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.810
 those who have had an accident or 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.510
 people who 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.040
 insta are ill but also just people 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.450
 who have a problem with alcohol or 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.849
 other things that you put somewhere in the gutter 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.700
 or the hell are ok " 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.200
 and yes the weather is nice I really like it 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.500
 combination indeed contact the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.290
 people drive it very slowly 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.390
 able to drive for important and i think 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.709
