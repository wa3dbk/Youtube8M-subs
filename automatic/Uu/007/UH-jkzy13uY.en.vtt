00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.230 

after<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.810> made<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.350> tutorial<00:00:08.010> about<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
after I made the tutorial about the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.990 
after I made the tutorial about the
glossiness<00:00:09.690> control<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.469> reality<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.309> looked

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
glossiness control in reality I looked

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.749 
glossiness control in reality I looked
at<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.450> scene<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.200> thought<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:14.549> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
at this scene and I thought that this is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.090 
at this scene and I thought that this is
really<00:00:15.089> reminding<00:00:15.750> me<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.590> movie<00:00:16.740> Titanic

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
really reminding me of the movie Titanic

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.790 
really reminding me of the movie Titanic
you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.570> directed<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.260> james

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
you know the one directed by james

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.859 
you know the one directed by james
cameron<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.240> happened<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
cameron and you know what happened to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.269 
cameron and you know what happened to
the<00:00:21.990> Titanic<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> yes<00:00:24.630> let's<00:00:25.410> add<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:25.710> water

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the Titanic so yes let's add some water

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.439 
the Titanic so yes let's add some water
to<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.990> here<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.170> water<00:00:29.070> plane<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
to this here is the water plane from the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.370 
to this here is the water plane from the
props<00:00:30.869> installed<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.920> reality<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.200> this<00:00:34.200> is

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
props installed with reality and this is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
props installed with reality and this is
one<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.920> best<00:00:35.489> starting<00:00:36.180> points<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
one of your best starting points so

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
one of your best starting points so
let's<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.590> double<00:00:37.860> click<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> plane<00:00:41.670> is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
let's just double click and the plane is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
let's just double click and the plane is
installed<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.980> looks<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> normal

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
installed in here it looks like a normal

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.430 
installed in here it looks like a normal
plane<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.510> its<00:00:45.750> already<00:00:46.079> subdivided<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:48.440> I'm

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
plane by its already subdivided and I'm

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
plane by its already subdivided and I'm
going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> move<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:51.559> right<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.250> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
going to move it right here and you can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
going to move it right here and you can
see<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> rectangle<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.000> i

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
see now the this is a rectangle so i

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.029 
see now the this is a rectangle so i
think<00:00:57.780> i'm<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> parameters

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
think i'm going to go to the parameters

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.229 
think i'm going to go to the parameters
and<00:00:59.570> rotate<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.469> i<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.770> rotate<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.219> by<00:01:02.250> 90

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and rotate it so i can rotate it by 90

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.740 
and rotate it so i can rotate it by 90
degrees<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.880> i<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> i<00:01:06.630> can

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
degrees and in that way i can i can

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
degrees and in that way i can i can
orient<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> better<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.890> room<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.460> i'm

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
orient it better for this room and i'm

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.160 
orient it better for this room and i'm
thinking<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.810> moving<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.790> oh

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
thinking about moving up a little bit oh

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
thinking about moving up a little bit oh
let's<00:01:13.170> say<00:01:14.390> yeah<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.880> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
let's say yeah this is about right and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.340 
let's say yeah this is about right and
now<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:19.170> resize<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.810> okay<00:01:21.810> let

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
now we can resize a little bit okay let

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.390 
now we can resize a little bit okay let
me<00:01:22.500> say

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
me say

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.400 
me say
and<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:27.580> little<00:01:28.570> bit<00:01:28.690> like<00:01:29.110> this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
and this and a little bit like this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.710 
and this and a little bit like this
let's<00:01:30.100> move<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:31.860> okay<00:01:33.240> let<00:01:34.240> me<00:01:34.360> see<00:01:34.540> what<00:01:34.690> we

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
let's move it okay let me see what we

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.930 
let's move it okay let me see what we
have<00:01:34.870> here<00:01:36.660> make<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.890> wider<00:01:39.460> here<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
have here make a little wider here and I

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.480 
have here make a little wider here and I
think<00:01:42.940> we<00:01:43.060> are<00:01:43.440> getting<00:01:44.440> there<00:01:44.680> right<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:47.490> if

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
think we are getting there right so if

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300 
think we are getting there right so if
we<00:01:48.700> look<00:01:48.730> at<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.200> Sun<00:01:50.200> for<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:50.680> scene<00:01:51.070> I

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
we look at the Sun for this scene I

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.490 
we look at the Sun for this scene I
moved<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.000> little<00:01:52.030> bit<00:01:52.450> I'd<00:01:52.930> move<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.230> little

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
moved it a little bit I'd move a little

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.100 
moved it a little bit I'd move a little
bit<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.010> let's<00:01:54.880> take<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.150> look<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.630> Sun<00:01:55.870> from

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
bit so let's take a look at the Sun from

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.770 
bit so let's take a look at the Sun from
the<00:01:56.260> Sun<00:01:56.500> point<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.160> view<00:01:57.310> which<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:58.750> of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
the Sun point of view which is one of

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.710 
the Sun point of view which is one of
the<00:01:58.930> best<00:01:59.229> features<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:01.150> studio<00:02:01.660> you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
the best features of of that studio you

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.040 
the best features of of that studio you
can<00:02:01.960> really<00:02:02.260> use<00:02:02.770> any<00:02:03.330> light<00:02:04.330> source<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:05.020> a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
can really use any light source as a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.120 
can really use any light source as a
camera<00:02:06.570> okay<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.840> see<00:02:08.140> how<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.860> know<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
camera okay so you see how you know the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.360 
camera okay so you see how you know the
camera<00:02:09.340> our<00:02:10.530> camera<00:02:11.530> for<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.800> scene<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.130> here

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
camera our camera for the scene is here

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.220 
camera our camera for the scene is here
so<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:13.209> are<00:02:13.300> looking<00:02:13.480> at<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:15.160> Sun<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:17.050> is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
so we are looking at the Sun and this is

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.430 
so we are looking at the Sun and this is
the<00:02:17.410> current<00:02:17.770> position<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:22.110> let's<00:02:23.110> call

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the current position and let's call

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.550 
the current position and let's call
reality<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:26.590> right<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:28.330> already<00:02:28.630> preset

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
reality all right and I already preset

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.770 
reality all right and I already preset
this<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.880> this<00:02:31.030> tutorial<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.630> move

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
this so that this tutorial can move

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.620 
this so that this tutorial can move
along<00:02:32.050> faster<00:02:32.910> basically<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.150> using<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
along faster basically we are using the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.870 
along faster basically we are using the
Clearwater<00:02:35.230> material<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.640> ripple

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
Clearwater material and the ripple

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.990 
Clearwater material and the ripple
amount<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.330> 0<00:02:37.720> 73<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:39.190> lowered<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
amount is 0 73 and I just lowered the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.900 
amount is 0 73 and I just lowered the
level<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:41.350> white<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.480> water<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.910> make

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
level of white of the water just to make

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.600 
level of white of the water just to make
a<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:46.060> less<00:02:46.480> clear<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.530> normal<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
a little less clear it's not normal the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.490 
a little less clear it's not normal the
default<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.150> pure<00:02:49.840> white<00:02:50.220> 255<00:02:51.220> 255<00:02:51.610> 255<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:53.350> we

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
default is pure white 255 255 255 so we

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.060 
default is pure white 255 255 255 so we
are<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:54.130> shade<00:02:54.660> lower<00:02:55.660> than<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
are just a shade lower than that and the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.550 
are just a shade lower than that and the
clarity<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.880> moved<00:02:58.600> from<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.140> default<00:02:59.530> of<00:03:00.030> 0.5

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
clarity is moved from the default of 0.5

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.920 
clarity is moved from the default of 0.5
20<00:03:02.560> point<00:03:02.830> 87<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.360> I'm<00:03:04.480> going<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.840> quick

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
20 point 87 so I'm going to do a quick

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.009 
20 point 87 so I'm going to do a quick
test<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.769> i'll<00:03:08.769> call<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.190> Titanic<00:03:09.820> lxs<00:03:10.720> and

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
test and i'll call this Titanic lxs and

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.660 
test and i'll call this Titanic lxs and
Titanic<00:03:11.799> for<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.820> pink<00:03:13.600> file<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.200> generated

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
Titanic for the pink file is generated

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.350 
Titanic for the pink file is generated
and<00:03:15.670> I'm<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.269> just<00:03:16.510> try<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.560> quick<00:03:18.360> fifty

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
and I'm going to just try a quick fifty

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.259 
and I'm going to just try a quick fifty
percent<00:03:19.750> render<00:03:20.500> because<00:03:20.709> waller<00:03:21.430> does<00:03:21.910> take

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
percent render because waller does take

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.770 
percent render because waller does take

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
a long time to render so you want to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.380 
a long time to render so you want to
assess<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.040> position<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.940> effect<00:03:28.239> of

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
assess the position and the effect of

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.590 
assess the position and the effect of
the<00:03:28.540> water<00:03:28.780> fairly<00:03:29.590> quickly<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:30.670> come

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
the water fairly quickly and then come

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.110 
the water fairly quickly and then come
back<00:03:31.630> make<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.500> adjustments<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.910> the

final render if you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:44.479 
final render if you
so<00:03:36.209> let's<00:03:36.450> let's<00:03:37.319> try<00:03:38.450> quick<00:03:39.450> export<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:43.489> here

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
so let's let's try quick export and here

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.319 
so let's let's try quick export and here
we<00:03:44.640> are<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.849> lux<00:03:46.579> this<00:03:47.579> will<00:03:47.819> take<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.090> little

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
we are in lux this will take a little

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.030 
we are in lux this will take a little
while<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:51.480> clear<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.200> I'm<00:03:52.470> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.709> fast

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
while to to clear so I'm going to fast

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.720 
while to to clear so I'm going to fast
forward<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.000> I'll<00:03:54.120> see<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.659> when<00:03:55.730> things

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
forward and I'll see you when things

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.520 
forward and I'll see you when things
start<00:03:57.239> getting<00:03:57.480> interesting<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:04.109> I'm

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
start getting interesting and I'm

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.720 
start getting interesting and I'm
changing<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.569> tone<00:04:06.569> mapper<00:04:06.870> from<00:04:07.730> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
changing the tone mapper from the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.030 
changing the tone mapper from the
nonlinear<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.569> linear<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:10.049> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
nonlinear to the linear one and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.670 
nonlinear to the linear one and
adjusting<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.790> exposure<00:04:12.230> maybe<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
adjusting the exposure maybe just a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.689 
adjusting the exposure maybe just a
little<00:04:13.799> more<00:04:14.069> sensitivity<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.480> film

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
little more sensitivity to the film

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.719 
little more sensitivity to the film
there<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.820> go<00:04:21.079> okay<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.139> at<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.889> point<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.430> see

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
there you go okay so at this point I see

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.350 
there you go okay so at this point I see
that<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:25.500> render<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:26.100> working<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.180> way<00:04:27.210> I

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
that the render is working the way I

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.950 
that the render is working the way I
expected<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:29.490> I'm<00:04:29.729> going<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.030> close

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
expected and so I'm going to just close

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.629 
expected and so I'm going to just close
this<00:04:32.750> change<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.990> resolution<00:04:34.199> so<00:04:35.009> we<00:04:35.250> can<00:04:35.460> get

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
this change the resolution so we can get

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.839 
this change the resolution so we can get
to<00:04:35.910> full<00:04:37.880> resolution<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:40.729> everything<00:04:41.729> is

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
to full resolution and everything is

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.089 
to full resolution and everything is
looking<00:04:42.030> pretty<00:04:42.330> good<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.990> think<00:04:43.169> also<00:04:43.620> one

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
looking pretty good I think also one

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.659 
looking pretty good I think also one
thing<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.490> want<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.820> do<00:04:45.060> maybe<00:04:46.220> now<00:04:47.220> in<00:04:47.430> this

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
thing I want to do maybe now in this

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.000 
thing I want to do maybe now in this
case<00:04:47.729> but<00:04:48.570> sometimes<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.349> want<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.710> change

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
case but sometimes you want to change

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.790 
case but sometimes you want to change
the<00:04:50.250> subdivision<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.360> go<00:04:51.539> up<00:04:51.630> one<00:04:51.990> level<00:04:52.020> it

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
the subdivision just go up one level it

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.520 
the subdivision just go up one level it
will<00:04:52.949> give<00:04:53.159> you<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.340> little<00:04:54.180> more<00:04:54.479> subtle<00:04:55.260> tea

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
will give you a little more subtle tea

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.589 
will give you a little more subtle tea
in<00:04:56.750> in<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.900> ripples<00:04:58.260> but<00:04:58.860> for<00:04:59.159> this<00:04:59.310> one<00:04:59.599> it's

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
in in the ripples but for this one it's

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.100 
in in the ripples but for this one it's
not<00:05:00.870> necessary<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:02.099> at<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.180> point<00:05:03.449> I'm<00:05:03.840> going

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
not necessary so at this point I'm going

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.920 
not necessary so at this point I'm going
to<00:05:04.229> render<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.620> frame<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:04.979> full<00:05:05.699> resolution

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.390 

so<00:05:14.150> this<00:05:15.150> is<00:05:15.360> how<00:05:15.629> you<00:05:15.659> create<00:05:16.620> water<00:05:16.979> in

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
so this is how you create water in

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.140 
so this is how you create water in
reality<00:05:18.059> I<00:05:18.439> hope<00:05:19.439> this<00:05:19.650> was<00:05:19.919> useful<00:05:19.949> my<00:05:20.909> name
