00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 welcome dear viewer in touch 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.700
 Andrew White and channel success without fools 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.820
 today I want to talk about 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.009
 how and when it makes sense to call 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.390
 girls on the phone if you're with a girl 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:23.300
 met each other 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.699
 and this video will contain good 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.200
 news for those who do not like with you 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.870
 such I actually think 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.330
 you can even participate in a small 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 such a vote actually and if 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.760
 conclusion do not like to call the girls there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.739
 we met before 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.449
 you can like this video 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.120
 and if you love if you bring 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.370
 pleasure this process you are straight to the state 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.289
 don't wait to do it then you can 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.409
 put dizlaik and you can see 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.420
 ratio, I suppose that all the same 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.769
 more people who do not like 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.969
 call on the phone 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:04.299
 but if we discover pickup theory 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.680
 all sorts of pick-up sites that writes there 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.890
 pickup experts roughly speaking so 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.869
 called they say that after 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.360
 how did you get the contact you need to call 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.119
 because the only way you are 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.929
 you will achieve the meeting only this way you will show 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.580
 that you're a man so brave, and so on then 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.310
 for example there to write dreams communicate 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.330
 social network it's not so cool not 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.090
 like a man and the type should supposedly give 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.810
 worse result is already a response from such 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.360
 tips 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 in many ways this theory in many ways all these 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.759
 pickup experts they repeat each for 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 friend where does root come from 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.959
 the very first one wrote it for whom everyone 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.110
 began to repeat then not to repeat for 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.580
 those who repeat smoking comes in 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.090
 mid nineties that is 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.599
 mid 90's the first these theories were written 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.690
 in the usa then in russia someone 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:03.050
 retyped translated retelling and 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.720
 so on and then the mid-90s that is 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.310
 principle twenty years ago it was 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.120
 much more important for simple 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.410
 the reason there were no options other than the phone 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.530
 smx were not so popular 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.129
 really really enjoy 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.930
 c m s had a different attitude 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.819
 that is, many people are somehow not 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 enjoyed it seemed it strange 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.290
 and so on as well as now somewhere in 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.540
 deep province village still 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.580
 there are people who are with them 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.870
 perceived to be uncomfortable to use no 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 such a habit and so on now 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.980
 Of course there are very few of these people, although I 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.980
 such met for example 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.670
 but see what is good 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.840
 the news is good but it is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.270
 that on the one hand 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.560
 phone calls they really 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.870
 many don't like me in this deep 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.460
 convinced that it is men that is not so 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 many of those people who feel like 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.840
 fish in water in this who can not do 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.720
 no mistakes and especially improve your 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.450
 impression when calling 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.240
 then in fact much easier it wraps 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.030
 trite to call the wrong moment or 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.550
 not be able to perfectly keep conversations by 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.590
 phone, but in fact it is not 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.850
 too simple especially with new acquaintances 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.770
 which you don't know very well 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.390
 which just include such here 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.740
 new girls that you meet 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.290
 but the good news is 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.360
 still that since when was written 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.600
 theory of the role of the phone is very strong 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.580
 changed and greatly decreased 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.580
 today, more and more people communicate in 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.260
 text less people communicate by 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.870
 phone fewer minutes average people 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.000
 spend on chatting on cellular calls 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.910
 spend more and more on text in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.040
 communicating with the meters and with social networks and the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.320
 the trend will only continue all 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.590
 more girls will even be the closest 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.840
 to friends 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.160
 other relatives are less responsible 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.780
 on the phone not to mention everyone 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.879
 the rest which often if you 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.830
 please call girl, she even 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.569
 if not very busy she may not take 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.790
 because she for example speaks with 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.069
 girlfriends only stunned by mom but more 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.629
 more and more girls who 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.700
 Even from mana, not before the call, change 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.549
 do they answer psn with ask what 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.500
 business because they like less 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.389
 break away from the current business break away 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.109
 from the current conversation is possible in which 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.949
 they are involved 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.040
 when they call or something else and this 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.280
 the trend goes ahead and it will only go 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.500
 next but this is good news for everyone 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.930
 those who do not like to call because 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.450
 that the reasons for calling is becoming 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.220
 shouts less call today at the very 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.370
 I donâ€™t really say anything 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.610
 specific case when calling is worth it 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.410
 there is 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.850
 it is perfectly possible to communicate psm with on 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.889
 social networks of course you need 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.300
 watch out 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.430
 preference for a particular girl in general 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.260
 a particular person i.e. the ceiling is not 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.910
 sitting in contact with someone at all 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.229
 pure music player let 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.139
 vkontakte they really are for me 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.940
 answer someone on the contrary does not look at 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.950
 their employee lying around cell phone 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.750
 for this corner while they are constantly 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.850
 online in a social network on the subject and 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.669
 here you need to find out for each person 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.860
 details specifically and when is it worth 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.040
 still call make a call 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.960
 worth 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.730
 in cases really worth even with 3 i 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.050
 would say the first case then if you 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.940
 treat minority 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.710
 who really like and very interesting 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.440
 call on the phones and you get very 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.600
 great pleasure from the second process 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.310
 Case when it's worth calling this when 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.590
 for example, you found that specific 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.440
 the girl she here and behavioral 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.580
 the pattern is what it is social networks 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.620
 I sit and do not actively communicate navy 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.600
 for example, for some reason, she is also active to me 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.270
 reflects on the phone she answers 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.610
 excellent and constantly responding 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.920
 quickly you know when she will answer and so 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.370
 further in such a rare casey really 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.970
 it is worth talking on the phone arrival you 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.040
 just adjust to the situation in 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.160
 such a case and the latter have it 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.870
 problem situation with for example if not 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.490
 very good until you met not 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.620
 made a very good impression 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.390
 like but for some reason 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.070
 interestingly bloody from communication can be 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.650
 especially liked the girl maybe 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.740
 you want for the sake of experience for the sake of experiment 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.830
 do it but you feel that when 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.110
 communicating psm with social networks 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.990
 It does not go bad at all and it is felt that 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.290
 Often his answer me often can be 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.820
 responds very long test shows that there is no 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.680
 there is no such good impression 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.740
 enough interest from the girl 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.320
 and then you can try this 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.060
 improve the situation with a call then 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.350
 there is so how can not meet 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.970
 but the call is to some extent 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.520
 imitation of some positive aspects 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.620
 personal meeting by individuals who can 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.120
 improve your impressions and you rudely 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.520
 by saying 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.710
 move more into the near circle given 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.700
 girls of such a situation yes you can call 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.800
 you need to have it of course have and need 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.290
 really use the bell to 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.720
 improve this impression is about yourself and 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.330
 not everyone is able but in all the others 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.890
 cases, I repeat once again special 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.400
 meaning if not doing it for the sake of 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.520
 fun hacking like today in 2015 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.370
 year and later roughly speaking already there is no 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.320
 there is a time gone by when this one 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.540
 the idea that it is necessary to you it was 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.130
 relevant 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.010
