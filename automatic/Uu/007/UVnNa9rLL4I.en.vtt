very<00:01:58.340> much<00:01:58.550> like<00:01:58.610> ourselves<00:01:59.450> after<00:01:59.630> all<00:02:00.280> why

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
very much like ourselves after all why

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.970 
very much like ourselves after all why
should<00:02:01.310> there<00:02:01.700> be<00:02:01.730> any<00:02:02.150> different<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:03.320> assume

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
should there be any different we assume

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.270 
should there be any different we assume
that<00:02:04.010> we<00:02:04.550> are<00:02:04.580> there

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that we are there

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
that we are there
of<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.729> creator<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> why<00:02:06.630> should<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> creator

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of a creator and why should the creator

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.969 
of a creator and why should the creator
be<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> freak<00:02:07.799> somewhere<00:02:08.220> else<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.569> they<00:02:09.750> are

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
be a freak somewhere else and they are

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.199 
be a freak somewhere else and they are
knockouts<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.100> every<00:02:11.340> respect<00:02:11.580> oh<00:02:11.940> absolutely

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
knockouts in every respect oh absolutely

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.540 
knockouts in every respect oh absolutely
except<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.200> little<00:02:13.410> further<00:02:13.560> advanced<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.310> many

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
except a little further advanced in many

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.660 
except a little further advanced in many
ways<00:02:15.290> now<00:02:16.290> why<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.160> weren't

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
ways now why is it that they weren't

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.900 
ways now why is it that they weren't
normally<00:02:18.420> land<00:02:18.690> yeah<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:20.100> they<00:02:20.250> have<00:02:20.459> landed

it's<00:02:47.010> Miller<00:02:47.489> purely<00:02:48.060> scientific<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.930> would

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
it's Miller purely scientific I would

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.840 
it's Miller purely scientific I would
say<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.500> has<00:02:49.680> been<00:02:49.920> put<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> other<00:02:50.550> side

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
say it has been put on the other side

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.630 
say it has been put on the other side
but<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.209> true<00:02:51.510> scientific<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.890> see<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.430> have

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
what they call a microwave Philemon

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.140 
what they call a microwave Philemon
where<00:04:05.310> did<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.519> get<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.670> from<00:04:05.760> one<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
where did you get it from one of the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.030 
where did you get it from one of the
flying<00:04:06.390> forces<00:04:06.600> yes<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.650> there's<00:04:07.829> two

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
flying forces yes and there's two

according<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.350> analysis<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.920> the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
according to the analysis of the

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.190 
according to the analysis of the
bookcases

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
bookcases

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.920 
bookcases
now<00:04:14.200> do<00:04:15.190> you<00:04:15.280> think<00:04:15.340> we<00:04:15.670> shall<00:04:15.850> see<00:04:16.090> more<00:04:16.600> of

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
now do you think we shall see more of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.900 
now do you think we shall see more of
people<00:04:17.590> from<00:04:17.769> other<00:04:17.859> planets<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.489> future

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
people from other planets in the future

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.840 
people from other planets in the future
well<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.540> think<00:04:19.900> so<00:04:20.350> if<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.190> record<00:04:21.549> saw<00:04:21.790> the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
well I think so if the record saw the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.580 
well I think so if the record saw the
followers<00:04:22.480> they<00:04:22.660> have<00:04:22.690> been<00:04:23.050> going<00:04:23.410> because

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
followers they have been going because

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.780 
followers they have been going because
uh<00:04:23.800> Natalie<00:04:25.680> Australia<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.950> lecture<00:04:27.580> down

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
uh Natalie Australia a lecture down

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.080 
uh Natalie Australia a lecture down
there<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:29.290> saw<00:04:29.530> force<00:04:30.100> flying<00:04:30.550> saucers

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
there and I we saw force flying saucers

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.520 
there and I we saw force flying saucers
right<00:04:31.270> after<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.690> lecture<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.200> is<00:04:32.320> all

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
right after the lecture that is all

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.800 
right after the lecture that is all
group<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:32.980> people<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.850> they<00:04:34.390> asked<00:04:34.690> me

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
group of people that and they asked me

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.200 
group of people that and they asked me
why<00:04:35.170> don't<00:04:35.230> they<00:04:35.590> land<00:04:35.830> here<00:04:35.950> as<00:04:36.550> they<00:04:36.970> might

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
why don't they land here as they might

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.210 
why don't they land here as they might
after<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.630> leave<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.590> thirteenth<00:04:38.980> day<00:04:39.070> of

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
after I leave on the thirteenth day of
