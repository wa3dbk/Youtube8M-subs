00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
snagit I'm coming to convert images and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.119 
snagit I'm coming to convert images and
it's<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:39.870> because<00:03:40.169> I've<00:03:40.290> highlighted<00:03:40.650> all<00:03:40.979> of

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
it's now because I've highlighted all of

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.830 
it's now because I've highlighted all of
those<00:03:41.250> images<00:03:41.579> it's<00:03:41.879> just<00:03:42.180> selected<00:03:42.659> them

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
those images it's just selected them

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.759 
those images it's just selected them
down<00:03:43.019> over<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.709> I'm<00:03:43.829> going<00:03:43.979> next<00:03:45.769> I'm

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
down over here and I'm going next I'm

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.949 
down over here and I'm going next I'm
coming<00:03:47.280> here<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.459> modify<00:03:48.090> I'm<00:03:48.239> choosing<00:03:48.659> image

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
coming here to modify I'm choosing image

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.749 
coming here to modify I'm choosing image
scaling<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.560> I'm<00:03:49.680> scaling<00:03:49.979> it<00:03:50.250> up<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.489> three

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
scaling and I'm scaling it up to three

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.069 
scaling and I'm scaling it up to three
hundred<00:03:50.819> percent<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.449> reason<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:51.750> do<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:51.930> is

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
hundred percent the reason I do this is

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.749 
hundred percent the reason I do this is
because<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.680> will<00:03:52.799> fit<00:03:53.069> really<00:03:53.280> well<00:03:53.400> on

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:53.759 
because then it will fit really well on

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.670 
because then it will fit really well on
to<00:03:54.509> a<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:55.049> four<00:03:55.590> piece<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:55.919> paper<00:03:56.250> go<00:03:56.699> next<00:03:57.680> you

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to a a four piece of paper go next you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.990 
to a a four piece of paper go next you
might<00:03:58.859> actually<00:03:59.040> have<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.370> experiment<00:03:59.759> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
might actually have to experiment a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520 
might actually have to experiment a
little<00:04:00.120> bit<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.479> that<00:04:00.509> for<00:04:00.840> me<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.109> works<00:04:01.290> that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
little bit of that for me it works that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.490 
little bit of that for me it works that
way<00:04:01.669> I'm<00:04:02.669> choosing<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.419> file<00:04:03.719> format<00:04:04.199> notice
