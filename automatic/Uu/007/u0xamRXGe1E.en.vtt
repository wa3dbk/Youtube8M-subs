in<00:00:04.420> 1979<00:00:05.230> I<00:00:05.380> got<00:00:05.620> my<00:00:05.710> first<00:00:05.890> digital<00:00:06.400> watch<00:00:06.670> it

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
in 1979 I got my first digital watch it

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.340 
in 1979 I got my first digital watch it
was<00:00:07.210> the<00:00:07.300> coolest<00:00:07.630> thing<00:00:07.750> you<00:00:07.930> could<00:00:08.080> own<00:00:08.200> at

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
was the coolest thing you could own at

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.709 
was the coolest thing you could own at
the<00:00:08.410> time<00:00:08.440> so<00:00:09.040> cool<00:00:09.340> even<00:00:09.549> James<00:00:10.000> Bond<00:00:10.299> had<00:00:10.540> one

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
the time so cool even James Bond had one

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.320 
the time so cool even James Bond had one
and<00:00:11.590> by<00:00:11.799> the<00:00:11.860> time<00:00:12.129> in<00:00:12.250> 1980<00:00:12.760> did<00:00:13.000> swung<00:00:13.209> around

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
and by the time in 1980 did swung around

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.180 
and by the time in 1980 did swung around
virtually<00:00:13.869> everyone<00:00:14.350> owned<00:00:14.530> a<00:00:14.650> digital<00:00:15.039> watch

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
virtually everyone owned a digital watch

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.370 
virtually everyone owned a digital watch
and<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.969> manufacturers<00:00:16.630> started<00:00:16.990> trying<00:00:17.289> to

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
and the manufacturers started trying to

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.499 
and the manufacturers started trying to
outdo<00:00:17.560> one<00:00:18.070> another<00:00:18.100> adding<00:00:18.730> extra<00:00:19.060> features

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
outdo one another adding extra features

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.419 
outdo one another adding extra features
things<00:00:19.689> like<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.929> calculator<00:00:20.590> or<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.859> personal

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
things like a calculator or a personal

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.990 
things like a calculator or a personal
organizer<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:24.160> made<00:00:24.369> people<00:00:24.699> think<00:00:24.730> the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
organizer and this made people think the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.519 
organizer and this made people think the
digital<00:00:25.150> watches<00:00:25.660> were<00:00:25.750> just<00:00:25.929> for<00:00:26.050> geeks<00:00:26.289> or

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
digital watches were just for geeks or

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.620 
digital watches were just for geeks or
nerds<00:00:26.560> so<00:00:27.519> they<00:00:27.609> dropped<00:00:27.880> them<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.300> went<00:00:28.449> back

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
nerds so they dropped them and went back

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.269 
nerds so they dropped them and went back
to<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.869> traditional<00:00:29.410> analog<00:00:29.710> style<00:00:29.980> watch

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
to the traditional analog style watch

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.940 
to the traditional analog style watch
and<00:00:31.169> recently<00:00:32.169> there's<00:00:32.380> been<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.560> bit<00:00:32.740> of<00:00:32.770> an

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
a normal watch it's incredible to think

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.170 
a normal watch it's incredible to think
given<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.890> quality<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> construction

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
and the clever design this whole thing

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.330 
and the clever design this whole thing
is<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.700> labor<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.120> love<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.720> one<00:03:16.900> chap

is the labor of love of just one chap
anyway<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.670> time<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.060> explain<00:03:19.360> how<00:03:19.510> it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
anyway it's time to explain how it

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.050 
anyway it's time to explain how it

operates to change the time you have to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.910 
operates to change the time you have to
unscrew<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.630> lid<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.049> then<00:03:23.410> left-hand

unscrew the lid and then left-hand

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.220 
unscrew the lid and then left-hand
button<00:03:24.070> changes<00:03:24.850> between<00:03:25.030> 12<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.600> 24<00:03:26.049> hour

button changes between 12 and 24 hour
modes<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.860> then<00:03:27.489> lets<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.820> adjust<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.269> hours

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660

and then the minutes and finally the
angle<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.750> want<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.320> operate<00:03:32.680> at

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
angle that you want it to operate at

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.560 
angle that you want it to operate at
because<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:33.640> based<00:03:33.880> on<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.090> tilt<00:03:34.420> mechanism

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570
