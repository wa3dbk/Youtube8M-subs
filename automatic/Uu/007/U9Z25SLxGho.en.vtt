Ironman<00:00:04.920> was<00:00:05.310> an<00:00:05.430> interesting<00:00:05.940> project<00:00:06.210> first

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
Ironman was an interesting project first

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.860 
Ironman was an interesting project first
the<00:00:06.930> director<00:00:07.410> came<00:00:07.649> us<00:00:08.330> brought<00:00:09.330> us<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.630> very

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the director came us brought us in very

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.049 
the director came us brought us in very
early<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:10.980> had<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> lot<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.519> really

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
early on and just had a lot of really

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.749 
early on and just had a lot of really
amazing<00:00:12.570> ideas<00:00:13.259> about<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> deal<00:00:14.730> with

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
amazing ideas about how to deal with

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.430 
amazing ideas about how to deal with
memory<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> deal<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:15.809> interface

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
memory and how to deal with interface

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.540 
memory and how to deal with interface
and<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> Tony's<00:00:18.350> workshop<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:20.400> did

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
and what is Tony's workshop and we did

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.970 
and what is Tony's workshop and we did
so<00:00:20.730> many<00:00:20.850> rounds<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.140> ended<00:00:22.859> up

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
so many rounds of that and it ended up

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.560 
so many rounds of that and it ended up
eventually<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.580> flowing<00:00:23.880> down<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
eventually just flowing down to the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.689 
eventually just flowing down to the
computer<00:00:24.930> system<00:00:25.199> itself<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.640> all

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
computer system itself and you know all

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.820 
computer system itself and you know all
the<00:00:26.939> interactions<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.630> come<00:00:27.810> along

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the interactions at come along

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.740 
the interactions at come along
the<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.189> challenge<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:30.000> deal

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the first challenge was to really deal

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.860 
the first challenge was to really deal
with<00:00:31.189> what<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.489> style<00:00:32.850> would<00:00:33.270> look<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
with what the style would look like and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
with what the style would look like and
could<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> carry<00:00:34.590> through<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.399> dark<00:00:35.760> hairs<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
could it carry through in dark hairs and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.760 
could it carry through in dark hairs and
light<00:00:36.329> areas<00:00:36.540> nice<00:00:36.750> shot<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.170> very<00:00:37.380> different

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
light areas nice shot was very different

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
light areas nice shot was very different
so<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.370> kind<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> caught<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> style

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
so we kind of caught with the style

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
so we kind of caught with the style
first<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> layering<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
first of the kind of the layering of the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
first of the kind of the layering of the
lines<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> dots<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> external

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
lines and the dots and the external

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.049 
lines and the dots and the external
information<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.850> extra

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
information and all that little extra

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
information and all that little extra
bits<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> detail<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.930> graphics<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> very

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
bits of detail and graphics in the very

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.260 
bits of detail and graphics in the very
beginning<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
beginning just like it was like a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
beginning just like it was like a
preferred<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.140> pre-production<00:00:49.800> all

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
preferred a very pre-production all

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.119 
preferred a very pre-production all
staged<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.399> were<00:00:50.579> meeting<00:00:51.890> them<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> they

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
staged we were meeting them and they

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.560 
staged we were meeting them and they
were<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.460> were<00:00:53.489> saying<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.090> yet<00:00:54.420> they

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
were they were saying that yet they

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
were they were saying that yet they
wanted<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:55.590> whatever<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.789> his

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
wanted to take whatever that was on his

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.869 
wanted to take whatever that was on his
table<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.780> sort<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
table and sort of have this in a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
table and sort of have this in a
holographic<00:01:00.359> environment<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.530> he's<00:01:01.949> workshop

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
holographic environment as he's workshop

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
holographic environment as he's workshop
so<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> could<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.449> move<00:01:03.600> anywhere<00:01:03.989> he

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so that you could just move anywhere he

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.320 
so that you could just move anywhere he
wants<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.189> he<00:01:05.339> wants<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.880> sit<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
wants or if he wants to like sit in the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.109 
wants or if he wants to like sit in the
chair<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.630> spin<00:01:07.530> around<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.159> turn<00:01:08.430> he<00:01:09.000> would

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
chair and spin around and turn he would

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.300 
chair and spin around and turn he would
be<00:01:09.299> able<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> did<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> lot<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
be able to do that and we did a lot of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.920 
be able to do that and we did a lot of
that<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.729> our<00:01:11.880> standing<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.630> did<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that with our standing we did a lot of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.330 
that with our standing we did a lot of
performance<00:01:13.320> pieces<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.830> trying<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> figure

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
performance pieces and trying to figure

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
performance pieces and trying to figure
out<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.360> thing<00:01:15.420> would<00:01:15.720> behave<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
out how this thing would behave would it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.340 
out how this thing would behave would it
expire<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> retract<00:01:17.520> how<00:01:18.299> organic<00:01:19.049> can

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
expire when it retract how organic can

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
expire when it retract how organic can
we<00:01:19.439> make<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.880> went<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.540> tests

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
we make it so we went for a lot of tests

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300 
we make it so we went for a lot of tests
before<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> final<00:01:23.040> plates

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
before we actually got the final plates

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.300 
before we actually got the final plates
from<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.240> Marvin<00:01:24.600> few<00:01:24.780> jon<00:01:24.930> favreau<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.590> once

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
from for Marvin few jon favreau and once

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
from for Marvin few jon favreau and once
we<00:01:26.430> had<00:01:26.580> those<00:01:26.820> Robert<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
we had those Robert and you know the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.740 
we had those Robert and you know the
very<00:01:28.049> strong<00:01:28.409> performance<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:28.979> always<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
very strong performance as always so it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.240 
very strong performance as always so it
kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.110> made<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.860> point<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
kind of made it easy at that point the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.179 
kind of made it easy at that point the
challenge<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:33.000> how<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:34.409> make<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.890> something

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
challenge was how to make it something

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.810 
challenge was how to make it something
that<00:01:35.479> served<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:37.380> Robert<00:01:38.130> Downey<00:01:38.340> jr.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that served what Robert Downey jr.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
that served what Robert Downey jr.
wanted<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.360> versus<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.320> we

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
wanted to do versus what you know we

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
wanted to do versus what you know we
found<00:01:40.680> an<00:01:40.829> interface<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.939> thought<00:01:42.299> we

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
found an interface with you I thought we

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
found an interface with you I thought we
had<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> lot<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.170> good<00:01:43.290> ideas<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.740> when

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
had a lot of really good ideas but when

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.389 
had a lot of really good ideas but when
it<00:01:44.220> came<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> getting<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> work<00:01:45.930> done

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
it came down to getting the work done

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.730 
it came down to getting the work done
it<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:49.200> he<00:01:49.259> felt

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it was really just all about how he felt

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.710 
it was really just all about how he felt
more<00:01:49.890> natural<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.579> performance<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
more natural in this performance and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.000 
more natural in this performance and
the<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.200> things<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:52.890> did

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
the kind of things that he did

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.280 
the kind of things that he did
interpretive<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:54.030> lot<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> lot<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.050> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
interpretive use a lot of a lot of the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.860 
interpretive use a lot of a lot of the
emotions<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.970> know<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.660> weird

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
emotions and the you know just the weird

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.600 
emotions and the you know just the weird
things<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:58.440> did<00:01:58.710> didn't<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.460> click

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
things that he did didn't really click

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.640 
things that he did didn't really click
with<00:01:59.700> us<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.180> first<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.690> think<00:02:00.930> once<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.530> got

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
with us at first but I think once we got

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.800 
with us at first but I think once we got
working<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.730> just<00:02:02.880> started

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
working like that it really just started

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.390 
working like that it really just started
to<00:02:03.870> make<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> lot<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.320> sense<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> just

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
to make a lot of sense and you just

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.190 
to make a lot of sense and you just
became<00:02:05.760> sort<00:02:06.120> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> fun<00:02:06.510> inspiration<00:02:07.140> on

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
became sort of the fun inspiration on

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020 
became sort of the fun inspiration on
how<00:02:07.410> do<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:07.560> make<00:02:07.650> something<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.429> appears

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
how do we make something that appears

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
how do we make something that appears
kind<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.450> often<00:02:10.020> sort<00:02:10.290> of<00:02:10.380> silly<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.740> be

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
kind of often sort of silly to be

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.270 
kind of often sort of silly to be
something<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:13.040> turned<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.250> very

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
something that turned out very

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.640 
something that turned out very
interesting<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.020> cuts<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
interesting one of the cuts in the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.340 
interesting one of the cuts in the
sequence<00:02:17.040> was<00:02:17.390> discovering<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.510> molecule<00:02:19.020> and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
sequence was discovering is molecule and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.050 
sequence was discovering is molecule and
it<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.560> buried<00:02:19.860> deep<00:02:19.890> inside<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.640> x-bow

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it was buried deep inside the x-bow

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.600 
it was buried deep inside the x-bow
model<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> key<00:02:22.200> kind<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.280> aha

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
model which was a key kind of like aha

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.270 
model which was a key kind of like aha
moment<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> film<00:02:24.570> where<00:02:24.900> he<00:02:25.650> was<00:02:25.800> really

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
moment in the film where he was really

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.310 
moment in the film where he was really
reaching<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.450> clues<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.020> trying<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
reaching out for clues and trying to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.380 
reaching out for clues and trying to
find<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.770> solve<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.550> had<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.730> always<00:02:30.030> keep

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
find and solve it we had to always keep

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.580 
find and solve it we had to always keep
in<00:02:30.450> mind<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.930> make<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.200> look<00:02:31.350> kind<00:02:31.560> of

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
in mind to make it look kind of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.140 
in mind to make it look kind of
interesting<00:02:32.100> visually

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
interesting visually

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
interesting visually
he's<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.720> struggling<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.800> you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
he's kind of struggling with that you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.880 
he's kind of struggling with that you
can't<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.240> can't<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.540> blast<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.650> scene

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
can't you can't just blast the scene

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.980 
can't you can't just blast the scene
with<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.700> crazy<00:02:39.000> emotions<00:02:39.690> they<00:02:39.959> have

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
with you really crazy emotions they have

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.940 
with you really crazy emotions they have
to<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.970> relatively<00:02:42.170> Kotik<00:02:43.170> also<00:02:43.830> at<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
to look relatively Kotik also at the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.949 
to look relatively Kotik also at the
same<00:02:44.100> time<00:02:44.160> because<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.240> it's<00:02:45.840> like

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
same time because it's like it's like

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.990 
same time because it's like it's like
his<00:02:46.260> workshop<00:02:46.740> it's<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.100> his<00:02:47.280> creative<00:02:47.730> mess

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
his workshop it's like his creative mess

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.760 
his workshop it's like his creative mess
it<00:02:48.300> was<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> very<00:02:48.690> thin<00:02:48.959> line<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.410> went<00:02:49.590> back

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
it was a very thin line and we went back

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.320 
it was a very thin line and we went back
and<00:02:49.800> forth<00:02:50.010> with<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.700> overly<00:02:51.150> detailed

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
and forth with kind of overly detailed

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.660 
and forth with kind of overly detailed
work<00:02:51.930> which<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.740> had<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.950> string<00:02:53.190> back<00:02:53.430> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
work which you had to string back and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.040 
work which you had to string back and
really<00:02:53.850> keep<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.150> cool<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> store<00:02:54.959> and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
really keep it cool to the store and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.140 
really keep it cool to the store and
what<00:02:55.260> he<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.500> trying<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.769> say<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.760> had<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.000> take

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
what he was trying to say we had to take

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.840 
what he was trying to say we had to take
it<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.510> completely<00:02:57.930> different<00:02:57.989> level<00:02:58.350> where

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
it to a completely different level where

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.490 
it to a completely different level where
where<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.970> will<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.780> add<00:03:00.989> layers<00:03:01.230> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
where you will need to add layers and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.650 
where you will need to add layers and
layers<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.850> things<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.090> would<00:03:03.209> make<00:03:03.239> sense

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
layers of things that would make sense

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.870 
layers of things that would make sense
it<00:03:04.410> was<00:03:04.560> still<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.739> hard<00:03:04.920> task<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> end<00:03:05.640> but

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
it was still a hard task in the end but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.509 
it was still a hard task in the end but
we<00:03:06.690> did<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:07.950> that's<00:03:08.160> what<00:03:08.400> it's

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
we did it do you know that's what it's

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.510 
we did it do you know that's what it's
about<00:03:08.610> well<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.640> what<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.269> here
