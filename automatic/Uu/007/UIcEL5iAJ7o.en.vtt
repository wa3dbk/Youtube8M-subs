pieces of harmonic minor in it
diminished<00:00:10.020> arpeggio<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.580> little<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
diminished arpeggio and a little bit of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:48.780 
diminished arpeggio and a little bit of
tapping<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.600> diatonic<00:00:13.049> arpeggios<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:14.430> goes

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.890

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
a passage that through a harmonic minor

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.850 
a passage that through a harmonic minor
here<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.270> goes

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
second piece is sliding through

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
second piece is sliding through
diminished<00:01:20.280> arpeggio<00:01:20.579> s<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> point

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
diminished arpeggio s and to the point

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:40.620 
diminished arpeggio s and to the point
where<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> hid<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.340> 18th<00:01:23.759> fret

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.179 

all<00:01:41.630> right<00:01:41.750> now<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.409> next<00:01:42.590> part<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.979> have<00:01:43.039> to

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
all right now the next part we have to

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.590 
all right now the next part we have to
break<00:01:43.340> down<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:43.880> basically<00:01:44.119> what<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.509> is

is<00:01:45.469> I'm<00:01:45.680> doing<00:01:45.740> an<00:01:46.250> arpeggio<00:01:46.579> pattern<00:01:47.000> walking

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
is I'm doing an arpeggio pattern walking

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.910 
is I'm doing an arpeggio pattern walking
it<00:01:47.990> down<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.579> then<00:01:49.579> I'm<00:01:49.670> tapping<00:01:50.000> as<00:01:50.360> well<00:01:50.929> so

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
it down and then I'm tapping as well so

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.050 
it down and then I'm tapping as well so
first<00:01:52.280> I'm<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.490> going<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.759> show<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.939> the

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
first I'm just going to show you the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.880 
first I'm just going to show you the
arpeggios<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:53.840> then<00:01:54.289> I'll<00:01:54.409> show<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.679> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
arpeggios and then I'll show you the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.200 
arpeggios and then I'll show you the
exact<00:01:55.220> tapping<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.640> goes<00:01:55.819> along<00:01:55.909> with<00:01:56.030> it

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
exact tapping that goes along with it

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:18.600 
exact tapping that goes along with it
here's<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.140> arpeggios

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.849 

Oh

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.440 

alright<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.519> next<00:02:26.639> part<00:02:26.999> of<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
alright the next part of this is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420 
alright the next part of this is
basically<00:02:27.810> you're<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.019> tapping<00:02:28.319> along<00:02:28.620> with

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
basically you're just tapping along with

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.429 
basically you're just tapping along with
each<00:02:29.639> of<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:29.999> pattern<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:31.170> you're<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.349> to

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
each of that pattern so you're going to

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.949 
each of that pattern so you're going to
be<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.889> twenty<00:02:32.280> second<00:02:32.760> fret<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.299> you're

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
be on the twenty second fret and you're

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.979 
be on the twenty second fret and you're
going<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.139> tap<00:02:34.379> on<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.709> E<00:02:35.010> string<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.840> B

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
going to tap on the E string the B

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:58.850 
going to tap on the E string the B
string<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.950> g<00:02:38.159> string

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.840 

so<00:02:59.860> at<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> end<00:03:00.069> you're<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.340> walking<00:03:00.640> down

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
so at the end you're just walking down

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.380 
so at the end you're just walking down
the<00:03:01.060> pattern<00:03:01.420> from<00:03:01.510> 20<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:03.040> 22<00:03:03.910> 18<00:03:04.330> 217<00:03:04.870> 215
