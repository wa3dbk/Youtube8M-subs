00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
usually people use salt I am going to be

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.910 
usually people use salt I am going to be
taking<00:02:55.410> some<00:02:55.440> lemon<00:02:55.980> zest<00:02:56.090> some<00:02:57.090> sugar

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.770 

mix<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:02.320> now<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.210> be<00:03:05.330> using<00:03:05.480> my

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
mix this now I'm going to be using my

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.190 
mix this now I'm going to be using my
hand<00:03:06.430> dip<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.550> in<00:03:07.670> some<00:03:07.910> lemon<00:03:08.300> juice<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.720> just

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
hand dip it in some lemon juice and just

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.030 
hand dip it in some lemon juice and just
apply<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.010> ribbon

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.250 

now<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> more<00:03:13.940> sensible<00:03:14.450> way<00:03:14.629> of<00:03:14.659> doing<00:03:15.080> it

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
now a more sensible way of doing it

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.869 
now a more sensible way of doing it
would<00:03:15.409> be<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.620> cut<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> slice<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.459> lemon<00:03:16.610> and

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
would be to cut a slice of lemon and

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.360 
would be to cut a slice of lemon and
then<00:03:17.030> apply<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:18.110> I'm<00:03:18.349> in<00:03:18.620> for<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> quick<00:03:19.129> one

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
then apply it but I'm in for a quick one

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.850 
then apply it but I'm in for a quick one
because<00:03:19.519> they<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:20.090> want<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.330> drink<00:03:20.540> that

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
because they really want to drink that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.380 
because they really want to drink that
