like<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.990> said<00:02:07.049> before<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.770> nine<00:02:08.069> levels

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
like I said before you have nine levels

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.380 
like I said before you have nine levels
and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.059

two<00:02:09.479> nine<00:02:09.660> stages<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.560> don't<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
two nine stages and you don't have to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.370 
two nine stages and you don't have to
have<00:02:11.390> nine<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.600> could<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.840> less<00:02:13.050> than<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
have nine you could have less than that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.850 
have nine you could have less than that
but<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> maximum<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.500> same<00:02:16.680> way

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
but that's the maximum in the same way

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.290 
but that's the maximum in the same way
that<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.130> add<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> level<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.880> add<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> stage

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
that you add a level you can add a stage

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.540
