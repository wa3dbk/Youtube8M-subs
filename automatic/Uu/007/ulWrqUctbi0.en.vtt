this<00:01:07.189> video<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.540> continue<00:01:10.439> winding

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this video and I will continue winding

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
this video and I will continue winding
it<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:12.479> many<00:01:12.840> minutes<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.830> takes<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it how many minutes it takes now it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.100 
it how many minutes it takes now it
takes<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:16.159> one<00:01:17.159> minute<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
takes around one minute right so you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.270 
takes around one minute right so you
keep<00:01:19.650> continue<00:01:20.490> grinding<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.450> ink<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> best

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
keep continue grinding the ink the best

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.850 
keep continue grinding the ink the best
way<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.240> soften<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
way to do it is that you soften it and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.390 
way to do it is that you soften it and
soak<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.100> into<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.549> water<00:01:29.869> for<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.229> minute

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
soak it into the water for one minute

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.480 
soak it into the water for one minute
then<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.900> smooth<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
then it is because more smooth now it is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
then it is because more smooth now it is
smooth

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:02:07.499 

I'm<00:01:41.880> sorry<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> song<00:01:43.979> although<00:02:06.509> another
