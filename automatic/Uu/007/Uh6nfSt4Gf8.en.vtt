00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.180 

so<00:00:02.760> one<00:00:03.149> way<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.659> introduce<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.770> basic

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
so one way I do is introduce a basic

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.039 
so one way I do is introduce a basic
strategy<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.089> get<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.750> started<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.440> game

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.730 

go<00:00:13.049> ahead<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> load<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.330> battle<00:00:15.680> see<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
go ahead and load up the battle see you

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.439 
go ahead and load up the battle see you
I<00:00:17.010> get<00:00:17.070> connected<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.029> battle

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
I get connected with so in this battle

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.480 
I get connected with so in this battle
it<00:00:21.510> looks<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.460> one

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it looks like going to be a one on one

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:34.870 
it looks like going to be a one on one
game<00:00:23.939> under<00:00:24.740> GA<00:00:25.740> planes

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.290 

so<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:35.810> basic<00:00:36.140> technique<00:00:36.590> is<00:00:36.830> to<00:00:37.040> first<00:00:37.640> put

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
so the basic technique is to first put

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.140 
so the basic technique is to first put
all<00:00:38.480> your<00:00:38.750> class<00:00:39.020> one<00:00:39.320> mex<00:00:39.620> on<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.640> green

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
all your class one mex on the green

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.740 
all your class one mex on the green
patches<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.610> maximum<00:00:43.820> amount<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.510> mex

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
patches so the maximum amount of mex

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.710 
patches so the maximum amount of mex
that<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.050> can<00:00:45.230> fit<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:45.770> avery's<00:00:46.340> nine<00:00:46.970> so<00:00:47.510> what

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
that you can fit on avery's nine so what

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.360 
that you can fit on avery's nine so what
I'm<00:00:47.810> doing<00:00:48.050> right<00:00:48.140> now<00:00:48.200> is<00:00:48.500> Olympic<00:00:49.070> nine

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
I'm doing right now is Olympic nine

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.710 
I'm doing right now is Olympic nine
films<00:00:50.080> classes<00:00:51.080> be<00:00:51.380> one<00:00:52.100> mex<00:00:52.370> on<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:53.180> green

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
films classes be one mex on the green

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.740 
films classes be one mex on the green
crystal<00:00:53.900> display<00:00:54.710> with<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.980> speed<00:00:55.250> up<00:00:55.400> to<00:00:55.520> 80

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.720 

yes<00:00:59.750> commander

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.690 

all<00:01:02.820> speed

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.270 

well<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.730> normally<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:10.250> make<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
well I normally do is I would make a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
well I normally do is I would make a
bunch<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.850> mech<00:01:12.540> class<00:01:12.930> ones<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.710> max<00:01:13.980> out

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bunch of mech class ones and I max out

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
bunch of mech class ones and I max out
the<00:01:14.400> key<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> bottom<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> once<00:01:18.420> i

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the key with the bottom on so once i

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.950 
the key with the bottom on so once i
have<00:01:18.780> 9<00:01:19.320> i'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> start<00:01:21.180> expanding<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
have 9 i'm going to start expanding to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
have 9 i'm going to start expanding to
the<00:01:22.050> next<00:01:22.850> green<00:01:23.850> patches<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.550> gain

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the next green patches so that can gain

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.880 
the next green patches so that can gain
more<00:01:27.530> AP<00:01:28.530> faster<00:01:29.100> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.790> gain<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.270> honey

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.499 

expansion<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.549> important<00:01:36.060> early<00:01:36.270> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
expansion is a very important early in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.530 
expansion is a very important early in
this<00:01:36.600> game

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.540 

on<00:01:40.840> my<00:01:41.200> way

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.290 

dog

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.440 

so<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.650> looking<00:01:55.800> for<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.490> next<00:01:57.120> green

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so as I'm looking for the next green

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.470 
so as I'm looking for the next green
patch<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.820> am<00:01:59.820> constantly<00:02:00.450> creating<00:02:00.950> more<00:02:02.480> mex

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
patch I am constantly creating more mex

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.070 
patch I am constantly creating more mex
as<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.260> explore<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.490> speed<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> found

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
as we explore on speed so here I found

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.719 
as we explore on speed so here I found
energy<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:07.740> passion<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> put<00:02:08.460> a<00:02:08.490> couple

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
energy and passion when I put a couple

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.980 
energy and passion when I put a couple
more<00:02:09.030> guys<00:02:09.210> on<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.050> speed<00:02:10.320> up<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:10.650> EP<00:02:11.990> go

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
more guys on there to speed up my EP go

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.700 
more guys on there to speed up my EP go
ahead<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.290> make<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> tank<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.840> case<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.110> get

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
ahead and make a tank in case I get

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:25.070 
ahead and make a tank in case I get
rushed<00:02:16.980> by<00:02:17.310> mess<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:21.450> honor

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.190 

right<00:02:25.350> away<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.210> see<00:02:27.420> my<00:02:27.570> AP<00:02:28.050> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
right away so as you can see my AP is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.100 
right away so as you can see my AP is
speeding<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:29.360> significantly<00:02:30.360> since<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.870> have

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
speeding up significantly since I have

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.760 
speeding up significantly since I have
more<00:02:31.980> than<00:02:32.250> nine<00:02:33.290> max<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.530> green<00:02:34.920> crystals

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
more than nine max on the green crystals

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.250 
more than nine max on the green crystals
so<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.060> strategy<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.690> make<00:02:40.110> as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so and this the strategy is to make as

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.780 
so and this the strategy is to make as
many<00:02:40.440> as<00:02:41.040> possible<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:43.100> haven't<00:02:44.100> ran<00:02:44.370> into<00:02:44.640> my

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
many as possible I haven't ran into my

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.810 
many as possible I haven't ran into my
pony<00:02:45.120> girl<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.780> let's<00:02:46.260> go<00:02:46.980> look<00:02:47.160> for<00:02:47.220> ever<00:02:47.670> see

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
pony girl so let's go look for ever see

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.800 
pony girl so let's go look for ever see
what<00:02:47.970> they<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.860> sysmex<00:02:50.190> are<00:02:50.820> cheap<00:02:51.570> to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
what they have but sysmex are cheap to

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.500 
what they have but sysmex are cheap to
make<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.380> make<00:02:52.830> as<00:02:52.950> many<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.340> soon<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:53.880> possible

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
make I make as many as soon as possible

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.949 
make I make as many as soon as possible
until<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:55.110> what<00:02:55.380> my<00:03:01.280> right<00:03:02.280> away<00:03:02.959> full

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
until I see what my right away full

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.580 
until I see what my right away full
speed<00:03:04.560> ahead<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.660> slowing<00:03:07.020> other

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
speed ahead so here like slowing other

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.720 
speed ahead so here like slowing other
areas<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:08.400> what<00:03:08.580> my<00:03:08.730> opponents<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.360> that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
areas to see what my opponents is that

expand<00:03:28.069> as<00:03:28.250> fast<00:03:28.519> as<00:03:28.670> possible<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.730> whoever

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
expand as fast as possible so whoever

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.369 
expand as fast as possible so whoever
takes<00:03:33.110> over<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.500> most<00:03:34.000> green<00:03:35.000> patches<00:03:35.689> will

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
takes over the most green patches will

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.190 
takes over the most green patches will
have<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:37.129> most<00:03:37.310> AP<00:03:37.939> and<00:03:38.239> therefore<00:03:38.810> create

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
have the most AP and therefore create

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.619 
have the most AP and therefore create

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
towards towards mine and I'm bringing

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.200 
towards towards mine and I'm bringing
them<00:04:49.050> into<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.410> view<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.919> battle

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.879 

so<00:04:55.210> what<00:04:55.419> this<00:04:55.630> guy<00:04:55.930> is<00:04:55.960> doing<00:04:56.169> right<00:04:56.560> now<00:04:56.710> is

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
so what this guy is doing right now is

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.379 
so what this guy is doing right now is
he's<00:04:56.919> taking<00:04:57.400> just<00:04:57.580> large<00:04:57.820> jump<00:04:58.120> down<00:04:58.240> on

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
he's taking just large jump down on

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.390 
he's taking just large jump down on
Yankee<00:04:58.570> mind<00:04:58.990> what<00:04:59.410> he<00:04:59.440> should<00:04:59.800> have<00:04:59.830> done<00:04:59.949> is

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
Yankee mind what he should have done is

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.960 
Yankee mind what he should have done is
back<00:05:01.210> up<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.720> makes<00:05:02.290> more<00:05:02.530> units<00:05:02.970> because

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
back up and makes more units because

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.580 
back up and makes more units because
he's<00:05:04.150> bringing<00:05:04.479> his<00:05:04.510> mother<00:05:04.840> ship<00:05:05.080> in<00:05:05.229> danger

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
he's bringing his mother ship in danger

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.820 
he's bringing his mother ship in danger
because<00:05:05.919> all<00:05:06.070> my<00:05:06.190> units<00:05:06.520> are<00:05:06.669> surrounding<00:05:07.120> him

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
because all my units are surrounding him

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.730 
because all my units are surrounding him
on<00:05:08.830> my<00:05:09.160> way<00:05:09.400> oh<00:05:11.010> there<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.100> goes

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.569 

there<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.550> basic<00:05:17.150> strategy
