00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello friends coming 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:16.309
 the season is approaching and the job search for 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.610
 getting a work visa is still onvif 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.600
 united states and communication with 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.620
 the approaching season for those who are looking 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.539
 work actively we do webinar webinar 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.320
 closed that is to order at it 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.429
 get there 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.309
 you will have to show me what your 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:40.609
 Does winter hang on daisy 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:43.100
 specifically for days and during 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.539
 webinar i recruit with ar a side 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.690
 I'll go for days 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.719
 and I will specifically show you that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.139
 correct in order for this summary 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:59.359
 was upstairs in search so you can 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:02.799
 instead of two calls there per day getting 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.799
 there may be 15-20 in this task 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.799
 so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.990
 just so curious about us 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.530
 but this is too much this bear will interfere as 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.840
 but if a person is looking for a job then we are with him 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.150
 do if you are not looking then not yet 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.030
 Here it is necessary to look for then shall 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.060
 so I understand that someone apparently 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.090
 may not yet hang us really 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.430
 for our purposes itâ€™s not so important that 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.590
 CV was cool because she 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.420
 life we we will not analyze we 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.700
 We will analyze how to resume 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.060
 it is released that is here user 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.940
 profile which is created by the applicant 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.040
 Chancellor's watch place here creates a profile 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.270
 and this profile 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.190
 pulls it up or vice versa 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.660
 lowers it down when searching by key 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.820
 words from recruiters 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.620
 resume is also a little involved 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.350
 the fire is only crammed with key 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.729
 in words but the lion's share of the result 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.870
 here it is gone so 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.910
 It is essential that some kind of thread be 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.610
 here and then you already there they can you 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.780
 whole life perfection and need 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.970
 perfect but lost got to 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.700
 understand how we are done and alive 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 examples of see and fix it all 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:28.230
 so the webinar means held in 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.230
 next saturday it means if today 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.970

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.750

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.730

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.519

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.860
 date and I'll write everything 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.290
 accordingly there in the table of contents webinars 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.920
 so that on the road do not say 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.690
 wrong and in order to take 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.060
 participation in this chosen 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:05.740
 so you owe me skype on emma 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.540
 tailors send your name so that i 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.520
 could find it in the resume ie you should 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.510
 to say that my first resume is at the daisy 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.520

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.890
 where is your resume there for days 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.660
 if he is not, I will tell you that he is not 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.650
 very often people do hang out 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.950
 that it can not be found 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.630
 and I created a special skype group and in 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.210
 this special group I will 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.180
 open webinar invitation 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.640
 which will not be available later wide 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.860
 it will be absolutely closing for the public 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.710
 such an event is just for those who 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.710

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.240
 if you have not subscribed to me on Skype 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.330
 does that mean m as Michael tailors from one 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.510
 the word at the end is the type of m tailors you 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.170
 connect and speak means you are a binary 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.670
