 Tripoli crashed this morning and a plane crashed in the Libyan capital Tripoli 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.190
 103 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.090
 to have died certainly is that in the device several 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.609
 Dutch passengers were present 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.070
 there is levine of this price in the alver and that is a dutch child 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.130
 the device came from side cake 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.589
 it crashed when it tried to land in tripoli 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.999
 the airbus 33 of the african year rbs was on its way to johannesburg 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.529
 tripoli when it crashed 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.529
 93 passengers and 11 crew members were on board 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.330
 the only survivor 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.710
 is a 10 year old boy 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.180
 years there were 22 libians on board 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.330
 Slaughter overs have different nationalities including a number 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.320
 Dutch passengers 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229
 between the wreckage, Dutch 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.650
 travel guide for south africa found 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.650
 nothing is known about the cause of the crash 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.240
 garate talk to our reporter koen message that is at Schiphol to come from 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.430
 to follow the latest news time there 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430
 koen what is the latest news about dutch people 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.750
 very sad news vianen 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.200
 just heard on until 62 Dutchmen have died confirmed 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.030
 this plane crash in the outpatient clinic 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.230
 two and six Dutchmen hence the low number of libians who died 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:18.969
 is therefore also 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.899
 Confirmed by the Minister of Transport Affairs 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.950
 22 people of libyan nationality escaped this plane crash 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.679
 so that's how 62 Dutchmen pointed out 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.599
 that also explains why the right word that Prime Minister Balkenende leaves 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.220
 this afternoon 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.600
 will give a statement about this plane crash on this piece one of the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.230
 larger in Dutch history with many Dutch at the same time 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.900
 come to be concrete 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.090
 make people explode the last thing boys were told 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.340
 because what do you know about this group of netherlands is a traveling party 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 that that and such a large group falls 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.520
 we still know he wants nothing about those groups, no doubt 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.630
 now there will be more information later this afternoon about we are currently arriving 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.200
 calling with travel groups 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.570
 about 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.190
 whether or not they actually let people travel via this route and what for 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.799
 groups that the olde sizes are over this afternoon 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.339
 what we do know is that the route is fairly popular while it is 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.749
 popular airline for travelers to south africa 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.959
 javi ten years first their airline that many cheap 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.149
 flights offers from amsterdam fiat the poli to south africa may also 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.189
 via london 30 dec leaves the clinic next to the africa 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.649
 those flights are fairly cheap and so became popular 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.589
 this flight news program south africa 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:39.520
 chow at six o'clock twenty man the ind at the plane airport of the tripoli 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.570
 we were flying to the network with adolf 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.790
 and then back to their own then the Dutch could go back 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.759
 to Amsterdam 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.279
 that was the original plan 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.670
 what's next to go terribly wrong two sets of Dutchmen once again 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 would have died 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.649
 on these planes 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.780
 I hope that there a Dutch child survived this crash 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.039
 admit it goes with him 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.929
 it is said that he is doing reasonably well 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.439
 Transporting Libyans would have said to fill the gap he put in it 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.649
 is in good condition 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.119
 that it is about a year the Dutch child 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.310
 we cannot say that the robbery is a boy or a girl 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.079
 Almere should also be clear about this later 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.489
 sad case a piece on that he is the only one of apparently 63 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.449
 Dutch people on 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.429
 on board the aircraft were killed 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.429
 his relatives have already been informed that you are working 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.000
 no better not yet that does not seem to me on the news at this stage really 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.819
 fresh i just heard it 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.869
 Peppers comes what I came to you and broadcasts 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.679
 the city will not have happened on the table, the dancers going with it 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.919
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs has set up a crisis team on it 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.089
 ministry to steer all information in the right direction and also here on earth 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.109
 tripoli airport 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.569
 and to obtain as much information as possible and therefore also 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.299
 The piste task will get to make the bodies of the Dutch so fast 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.360
 possibly the Netherlands 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.020
 so to be able to identify them also the bodies 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.509
 what a celebration with the tasks that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now has 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.809
 it will only be one in advance with the worst on it 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.560
 such images of that device where almost nothing works at all from partying 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.560
 we now know more about the accident 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.509
 also not so many libian media report that there 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.520
 before the pilot saw contact with the traffic control and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.770
 he had already warned air traffic control that the ambulances were going to it 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.420
 should arrive at the airport 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.409
 because something was wrong and would be on a sofa in the schedule 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.400
 there are so the pilots would have reported 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 to air traffic control how thus libian media 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.680
 moen 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.540
 there was something wrong with the plane 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.759
 the the 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.190
 Libyan authorities have already ruled out 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.729
 that it is a terrorist attack 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.270
 how they know that is not yet clear to us 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.310
 that could possibly be related to the pilots' last call 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.400
 the air traffic control we know about a kilometer 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.979
 for the runway happened in tripoli 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.370
 and that they must have gone at a tremendous speed the images that you now 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.839
 see 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.909
 sometimes we go see a plane were really nothing at all 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.210
 about that indicates the plane with a huge blow 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.250
 after primary school 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.050
 how reliable 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.050
 there is this airline 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.020
 about the reliability I dare I do not make a statement I already say something 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.469
 About the background of this contains society it has been established 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.469
 he by the libyan state it is an irisl state shipping company 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.780
 who aimed to connect the oats better with each other that is 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.550
 Another major issue in Africa's accessibility 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.319
 and mohammed kaddafi will 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.559
 partly for its political popularity so we can be reached more easily from the quay 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:48.270
 can also reach a 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.669
 if that is ten years, it is aimed at its own cost airline 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.650
 but does have the latest aircraft the airbus a330 200 which pitstop accident 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.490
 happened was one of three aircraft 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.409
 of the three types of device of the three devices must say good 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.499
 of this type 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:08.030
 10 love ended ten years in the driving 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.749
 and they were less than a year old 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.389
 as for the state of the plane year that will undoubtedly be a good one 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.569
 have been able because why very young 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.699
 airbus the manufacturer of the 9 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.939
 has already said that they fully cooperate in the investigation because they 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:23.749
 even a team 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.229
 what tripoli have sent to 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.020
 to help find the cause of this text 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.810
 where i say it again for which people you have to get involved 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.740
 confirmed is just dog 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.199
 that 62 Dutch people died 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.460
 after the latter is what now comes via press with her baby then 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.960
 and that it would therefore be a Dutch passenger going with it 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.960
 Dutch travel agency 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.719
 when expected and that hits you said Prime Minister Balkenende comes off with one 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.719
 explanation when he expects her to be made more known 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.629
 cadel mourns no more information now that it will follow very quickly 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.520
 because we know that there 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.360
 also unconfirmed messages but that seems pretty clear 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.090
 that the morning at the Libyan embassy another press conference 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.530
 will be given by the libyan ambassador what will be said there 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.009
 so unclear hopefully we will get more information there 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:15.550
 or what options are going on 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.500
 and of course also from the club 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.439
 that appears to be true 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.930
 With a travel organization scratch involved here is also there 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.610
 no doubt a strong one will come soon but at what time 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.380
 the people here would be expected 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.930
 and whether there is now 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.940
 the family is informed as I said the two are not yet but the 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.139
 information will now come very quickly it happened this morning at 6 a.m. local time 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.259
 tripoli 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.729
 and now there must be more clear 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.819
 to inform the Court Schiphol years everything for us as soon as there is more 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:46.570
 is news 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.090
 You can of course also come back during this broadcast
