00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
Paragon is the way to go it's can be

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
Paragon is the way to go it's can be
double<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.740> price<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.310> another<00:01:32.520> machine<00:01:32.790> but

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
double the price of another machine but

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
double the price of another machine but
it<00:01:34.110> definitely<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.650> last<00:01:34.950> twice<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.369> long<00:01:35.579> if

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it definitely will last twice as long if
