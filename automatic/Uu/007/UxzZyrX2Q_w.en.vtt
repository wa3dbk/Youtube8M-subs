all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> model<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.979> heart

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
all right this is a model of the heart

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.210 
all right this is a model of the heart
and<00:00:02.780> you<00:00:03.780> can<00:00:03.929> appreciate<00:00:04.140> how<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.680> heart<00:00:05.069> is

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
and you can appreciate how the heart is

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.890 
and you can appreciate how the heart is
divided<00:00:05.670> into<00:00:05.940> four<00:00:06.270> chambers<00:00:06.649> we<00:00:07.649> have<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
divided into four chambers we have the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.940 
divided into four chambers we have the
right<00:00:09.900> atrium<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:11.730> left<00:00:12.000> atrium<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.950> left

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
right atrium the left atrium the left

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.640 
right atrium the left atrium the left
ventricle<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:16.470> right<00:00:16.680> ventricle<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.560> we

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
ventricle and the right ventricle so we

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.080 
ventricle and the right ventricle so we
can<00:00:19.800> kind<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.070> open<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.609> bit<00:00:20.880> like

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
can kind of open it up a little bit like

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
can kind of open it up a little bit like
this<00:00:21.330> actually<00:00:22.109> let's<00:00:22.470> begin<00:00:22.769> however<00:00:23.039> by

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
this actually let's begin however by

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
this actually let's begin however by
closing<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.939> heart<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.529> appreciate

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
closing the heart up you can appreciate

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
closing the heart up you can appreciate
how<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.730> ventricle<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.330> blue<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.840> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
how the right ventricle is blue in this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.339 
how the right ventricle is blue in this
particular<00:00:28.410> model<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.250> indicate<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.760> it's

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
particular model to indicate that it's

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.420 
particular model to indicate that it's
deoxygenated<00:00:31.349> blood<00:00:31.500> that's<00:00:31.859> traveling<00:00:32.340> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
deoxygenated blood that's traveling to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
deoxygenated blood that's traveling to
the<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.669> side<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> heart<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.920> left

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the right side of the heart the left

the right side of the heart the left
side<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> hard<00:00:35.700> however<00:00:35.910> gets<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.480> oxygen

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
side the hard however gets the oxygen

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.979 
side the hard however gets the oxygen
gets<00:00:37.290> oxygenated<00:00:37.950> blood<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.629> why<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
gets oxygenated blood and why this is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.450 
gets oxygenated blood and why this is
orange<00:00:40.320> we'll<00:00:40.590> never<00:00:40.829> know<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.250> nonetheless

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
orange we'll never know but nonetheless

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.139 
orange we'll never know but nonetheless
it<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.879> oxygenated<00:00:42.570> blood<00:00:43.160> as<00:00:44.160> opposed<00:00:45.030> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it is oxygenated blood as opposed to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.900 
it is oxygenated blood as opposed to
blue<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.899> okay<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.579> all<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:47.730> well

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
blue right okay good all right well

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.930 
blue right okay good all right well
let's<00:00:48.059> take<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> look<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.309> maybe<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> few

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
let's take a look first at maybe a few

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
let's take a look first at maybe a few
grooves<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.410> around<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> heart<00:00:53.070> in

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
grooves that we have around the heart in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.420 
grooves that we have around the heart in
the<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> area<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> cardiac<00:00:55.680> skeleton

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the in the area of the cardiac skeleton

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.819 
the in the area of the cardiac skeleton
is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.120> groove<00:00:57.510> between<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> atria<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is a groove between the atria and the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
is a groove between the atria and the
ventricles<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> referred<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> as

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ventricles and this is referred to as

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.789 
ventricles and this is referred to as
the<00:01:01.260> atrial<00:01:01.859> ventricular<00:01:02.190> groove<00:01:03.799> there's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the atrial ventricular groove there's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.490 
the atrial ventricular groove there's
also<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.309> groove<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> region<00:01:06.810> where<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
also a groove in the region where the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250 
also a groove in the region where the
wall<00:01:07.740> between<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.400> two<00:01:08.549> ventricles<00:01:08.700> lies<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
wall between the two ventricles lies you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.750 
wall between the two ventricles lies you
can<00:01:10.409> appreciate<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.430> wall

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
can appreciate that this is a wall

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.060 
can appreciate that this is a wall
between<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.360> ventricles<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:13.680> call<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
between the two ventricles we call this

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.730 
between the two ventricles we call this
the<00:01:14.250> interventricular<00:01:14.670> septum<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.750> likewise

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the interventricular septum and likewise

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.609 
the interventricular septum and likewise
where<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> septum<00:01:17.759> exists<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.259> groove

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
where the septum exists we have a groove

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.600 
where the septum exists we have a groove
that<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.700> blood<00:01:21.000> vessels<00:01:21.110> rest<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
that these blood vessels rest in and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.660 
that these blood vessels rest in and
therefore<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> inner<00:01:24.290> ventricular

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
therefore this is the inner ventricular

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.039 
therefore this is the inner ventricular
septum<00:01:26.670> septum<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> interventricular

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
septum septum with the interventricular

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
septum septum with the interventricular
groove<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> groove<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
groove so the groove is the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.830 
groove so the groove is the
interventricular<00:01:30.540> groove<00:01:31.970> all<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.240> well

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
interventricular groove all right well

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.649 
interventricular groove all right well
let's<00:01:34.470> take<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> look<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.280> some<00:01:35.759> blood<00:01:36.210> vessels

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
let's take a look at some blood vessels

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
let's take a look at some blood vessels
so<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> begin<00:01:38.490> by<00:01:38.790> taking<00:01:39.030> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so I'm going to begin by taking this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109 
so I'm going to begin by taking this
heart<00:01:40.229> model<00:01:40.650> off<00:01:40.799> let's<00:01:41.520> look<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> big

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
heart model off let's look at the big

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.300 
heart model off let's look at the big
blood<00:01:42.479> vessel<00:01:42.960> first<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.500> great<00:01:43.770> big<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.159> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
blood vessel first this great big one is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.100 
blood vessel first this great big one is
the<00:01:44.460> aorta<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.049> essentially<00:01:46.950> sending

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the aorta this is essentially sending

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.620 
the aorta this is essentially sending
oxygenated<00:01:49.110> blood<00:01:49.320> throughout<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> body<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
oxygenated blood throughout the body and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
oxygenated blood throughout the body and
of<00:01:51.630> course<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.020> arising<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.460> left

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
of course it's arising from the left

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.249 
of course it's arising from the left
ventricle<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.729> large<00:01:57.180> vessel<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.899> front<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
ventricle this large vessel in front of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
ventricle this large vessel in front of
it<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.500> also<00:01:58.740> an<00:01:59.009> artery<00:01:59.399> believe<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> or<00:01:59.939> not

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it is also an artery believe it or not

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
it is also an artery believe it or not
in<00:02:00.299> spite<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> fact<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.259> blue<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in spite of the fact that it is blue and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.709 
in spite of the fact that it is blue and
this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.399> referred<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.299> pulmonary

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
this is referred to as the pulmonary

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.109 
this is referred to as the pulmonary
trunk<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.860> pulmonary<00:02:05.340> trunk<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> be

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
trunk the pulmonary trunk is going to be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.469 
trunk the pulmonary trunk is going to be
branching<00:02:06.750> into<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.170> pulmonary<00:02:07.740> arteries<00:02:08.220> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
branching into two pulmonary arteries a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.120 
branching into two pulmonary arteries a
left<00:02:09.479> pulmonary<00:02:09.929> artery

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
left pulmonary artery

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.080 
left pulmonary artery
and<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.670> right<00:02:11.880> pulmonary<00:02:12.150> artery<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:14.610> notice

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and a right pulmonary artery now notice

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.530 
and a right pulmonary artery now notice
that<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.630> pulmonary<00:02:16.230> arteries<00:02:16.710> are<00:02:16.920> blue

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that these pulmonary arteries are blue

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.350 
that these pulmonary arteries are blue
right<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:19.260> color<00:02:19.650> which<00:02:20.010> means<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.180> are

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
right in color which means that they are

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.500 
right in color which means that they are
transporting<00:02:22.310> deoxygenated<00:02:23.310> blood<00:02:23.460> but<00:02:24.360> they

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
transporting deoxygenated blood but they

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.630 
transporting deoxygenated blood but they
are<00:02:24.660> arteries<00:02:25.140> by<00:02:25.350> definition<00:02:25.740> because

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
are arteries by definition because

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240 
are arteries by definition because
arteries<00:02:27.390> send<00:02:27.720> blood<00:02:27.960> away<00:02:28.200> from<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.830> heart

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
arteries send blood away from the heart

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.080 
arteries send blood away from the heart
so<00:02:29.940> both<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.330> aorta<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.860> pulmonary

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
so both the aorta and the pulmonary

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.810 
so both the aorta and the pulmonary
trunk<00:02:33.090> are<00:02:33.450> arteries

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
trunk are arteries

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.900 
trunk are arteries
likewise<00:02:35.820> veins<00:02:36.330> send<00:02:36.840> blood<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> heart

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
likewise veins send blood to the heart

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.270 
likewise veins send blood to the heart
here's<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.030> very<00:02:39.480> large<00:02:39.810> vein<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.500> another

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
here's a very large vein and another

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.790 
here's a very large vein and another
very<00:02:41.910> large<00:02:42.000> vein<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.840> these<00:02:43.530> two

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
very large vein and these two

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.530 
very large vein and these two
collectively<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.610> called<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.060> vena<00:02:45.240> cava

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
collectively are called the vena cava

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.870 
collectively are called the vena cava
this<00:02:46.380> would<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.830> superior<00:02:47.220> vena<00:02:47.520> cava

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
this would be the superior vena cava

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.100 
this would be the superior vena cava
this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> inferior<00:02:49.380> vena<00:02:49.740> cava<00:02:49.940> again

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
this is the inferior vena cava again

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.730 
this is the inferior vena cava again
blood<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.320> brought<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.920> heart<00:02:53.310> via<00:02:54.090> veins

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
blood is brought to the heart via veins

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.220 
blood is brought to the heart via veins
now<00:02:55.740> blood<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.790> coming<00:02:57.120> from<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.450> lungs<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
now blood is coming from the lungs to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.490 
now blood is coming from the lungs to
the<00:02:58.350> heart<00:02:58.710> on<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.670> left<00:02:59.910> side<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:01.320> also

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the heart on the left side so we also

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.680 
the heart on the left side so we also
have<00:03:01.830> veins<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.610> left<00:03:02.820> side<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.480> these

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
have veins on the left side but these

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.050 
have veins on the left side but these
veins<00:03:04.050> are<00:03:04.290> red<00:03:04.560> because<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.430> blood<00:03:05.730> coming

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
veins are red because the blood coming

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.540 
veins are red because the blood coming
from<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.360> lungs<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.080> oxygenated<00:03:07.800> blood<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
from the lungs is oxygenated blood and

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.050 
from the lungs is oxygenated blood and
so<00:03:09.390> these<00:03:09.630> would<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.080> pulmonary<00:03:10.650> veins<00:03:11.160> so

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
so these would be the pulmonary veins so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.240 
so these would be the pulmonary veins so
there's<00:03:12.270> two<00:03:12.630> here<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> left<00:03:14.070> side

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
there's two here on the left side

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.090 
there's two here on the left side
draining<00:03:14.820> into<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> left<00:03:15.390> atrium<00:03:16.100> and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
draining into the left atrium and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.460 
draining into the left atrium and
there's<00:03:17.640> two<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.210> right<00:03:18.510> side<00:03:18.840> also

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
there's two on the right side also

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.360 
there's two on the right side also
draining<00:03:19.800> into<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.280> left<00:03:20.670> atrium<00:03:22.130> okay<00:03:23.130> good

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
draining into the left atrium okay good

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.120 
draining into the left atrium okay good
well<00:03:24.360> let's<00:03:24.450> talk<00:03:24.720> about<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.380> blood<00:03:25.680> that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
well let's talk about the blood that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.210 
well let's talk about the blood that
vessels<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.240> feed<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.380> heart<00:03:28.590> itself<00:03:28.890> feed

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
vessels that feed the heart itself feed

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.890 
vessels that feed the heart itself feed
blood<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.700> heart<00:03:29.820> itself<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:30.510> drain<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
blood to the heart itself and drain the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.220 
blood to the heart itself and drain the
heart<00:03:31.110> let's<00:03:32.040> begin<00:03:32.370> by<00:03:32.400> looking<00:03:33.240> at<00:03:33.570> two<00:03:33.930> that

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
heart let's begin by looking at two that

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.250 
heart let's begin by looking at two that
are<00:03:34.350> associated<00:03:34.680> directly<00:03:35.250> with<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.260> aorta

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
are associated directly with the aorta

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.070 
are associated directly with the aorta
so<00:03:38.040> coming<00:03:38.490> off<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.850> aorta<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.660> one<00:03:39.900> on

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so coming off the aorta is this one on

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.930 
so coming off the aorta is this one on
the<00:03:40.200> right<00:03:40.350> side<00:03:40.410> simply<00:03:41.370> called<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.670> right

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the right side simply called the right

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940 
the right side simply called the right
coronary<00:03:42.420> artery<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.110> then<00:03:43.710> there's<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
coronary artery and then there's a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.680 
coronary artery and then there's a
little<00:03:44.130> stubby<00:03:44.610> one<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.270> left<00:03:45.510> side

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
little stubby one on the left side

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.650 
little stubby one on the left side
called<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> left<00:03:46.530> coronary<00:03:46.980> artery<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:48.420> left

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
called the left coronary artery the left

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.960 
called the left coronary artery the left
coronary<00:03:49.080> artery<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.740> going<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.130> branch<00:03:50.460> into

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
coronary artery is going to branch into

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.870 
coronary artery is going to branch into
two<00:03:51.240> arteries<00:03:52.080> this<00:03:52.890> one<00:03:53.100> going<00:03:53.370> around<00:03:53.490> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
two arteries this one going around the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.820 
two arteries this one going around the
heart<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.480> circumflex<00:03:54.960> artery<00:03:55.440> again

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
heart is the circumflex artery again

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.250 
heart is the circumflex artery again
that's<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.190> red<00:03:56.430> vessel<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.810> one<00:03:57.960> going

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
that's the red vessel and the one going

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.470 
that's the red vessel and the one going
down<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.550> inner<00:03:59.820> ventricular

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
down here in this inner ventricular

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.580 
down here in this inner ventricular
groove<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.140> red<00:04:01.290> one<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.310> anterior

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
groove the red one is the anterior

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.200 
groove the red one is the anterior
interventricular<00:04:04.910> artery<00:04:07.730> if<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:08.910> take<00:04:09.150> a

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
interventricular artery if we take a

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.710 
interventricular artery if we take a
look<00:04:09.510> down<00:04:09.810> here<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:11.180> right<00:04:12.180> coronary

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
look down here this right coronary

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.560 
look down here this right coronary
artery<00:04:13.340> persists<00:04:14.340> all<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.670> way<00:04:14.820> down<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.510> we

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
artery persists all the way down and we

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.660 
artery persists all the way down and we
have<00:04:15.990> an<00:04:16.170> artery<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.739> kind<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.010> goes<00:04:17.190> off<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
have an artery that kind of goes off the

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.310 
have an artery that kind of goes off the
side<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.060> heart<00:04:18.270> here<00:04:18.600> we're<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.200> going

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
side of the heart here we're not going

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.780 
side of the heart here we're not going
to<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.500> bothered<00:04:19.890> with<00:04:19.919> these<00:04:20.220> others<00:04:20.520> who

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
to be bothered with these others who

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.520 
to be bothered with these others who
knows<00:04:20.970> what<00:04:21.180> they're<00:04:21.330> supposed<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:21.870> but

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
knows what they're supposed to be but

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.810 
knows what they're supposed to be but
this<00:04:22.680> particular<00:04:22.860> one<00:04:23.220> in

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
this particular one in

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.840 
this particular one in
the<00:04:24.090> marginal<00:04:24.960> artery<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.340> particular

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
the marginal artery so this particular

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.960 
the marginal artery so this particular
artery<00:04:27.420> at<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.690> base<00:04:27.900> here<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:29.010> marginal

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
artery at the base here is the marginal

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.430 
artery at the base here is the marginal
aren't<00:04:30.180> really<00:04:30.510> not<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> base<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.230> heart

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
aren't really not the base of the heart

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.260 
aren't really not the base of the heart
this<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.710> going<00:04:31.980> more<00:04:32.160> toward<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.580> apex<00:04:32.760> the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
this is going more toward the apex the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.850 
this is going more toward the apex the
point<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.720> heart<00:04:33.900> but<00:04:34.590> I'm<00:04:34.710> just

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
point of the heart but I'm just

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.620 
point of the heart but I'm just
referring<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.760> series<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.330> arteries

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
referring to the series of arteries

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.450 
referring to the series of arteries
would<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:36.930> at<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.140> base<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.380> them<00:04:37.770> right<00:04:38.190> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
would be at the base of them right and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.000 
would be at the base of them right and
so<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:40.470> again<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.040> marginal<00:04:41.730> artery<00:04:43.010> all

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
so this again is the marginal artery all

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.010 
so this again is the marginal artery all
right<00:04:44.220> now<00:04:44.610> let's<00:04:45.060> take<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.300> look<00:04:45.510> at<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> veins

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
right now let's take a look at the veins

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.860 
right now let's take a look at the veins
and<00:04:46.440> probably<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> best<00:04:47.580> way<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.910> look<00:04:48.630> at<00:04:48.780> the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
and probably the best way to look at the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.640 
and probably the best way to look at the
veins<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.530> essentially<00:04:50.660> take<00:04:51.660> blood<00:04:52.320> from

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
veins that essentially take blood from

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.920 
veins that essentially take blood from
the<00:04:52.770> heart<00:04:52.920> muscle<00:04:53.370> be<00:04:54.060> at<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> back<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.660> a

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
the heart muscle be at the back of a

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.170 
the heart muscle be at the back of a
heart<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.710> have<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.890> very<00:04:56.100> large<00:04:56.430> vein<00:04:56.790> here

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
heart you have a very large vein here

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.760 
heart you have a very large vein here
and<00:04:57.420> actually<00:04:57.600> we've<00:04:57.900> followed<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.440> all<00:04:58.650> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
and actually we've followed that all the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.520 
and actually we've followed that all the
way<00:04:58.890> from<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.190> front<00:04:59.370> let's<00:04:59.670> do<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:00.060> first

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
way from the front let's do that first

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.700 
way from the front let's do that first
so<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.160> very<00:05:02.580> large<00:05:03.240> vein<00:05:03.710> travels

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
so this is a very large vein travels

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.820 
so this is a very large vein travels
from<00:05:05.060> here<00:05:06.060> all<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.300> way<00:05:06.660> around<00:05:06.830> following

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
from here all the way around following

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.670 
from here all the way around following
the<00:05:07.950> circumflex<00:05:08.400> artery<00:05:09.020> all<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.200> way<00:05:10.350> around

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
the circumflex artery all the way around

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.190 
the circumflex artery all the way around
to<00:05:11.240> essentially<00:05:12.240> draining<00:05:12.720> in<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:12.960> big

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
to essentially draining in this big

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.580 
to essentially draining in this big
bulge<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:14.610> large<00:05:15.360> vein<00:05:15.930> is<00:05:16.200> called<00:05:16.470> the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
bulge and this large vein is called the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.660 
bulge and this large vein is called the
great<00:05:16.830> cardiac<00:05:17.430> vein<00:05:19.010> likewise<00:05:20.010> there's<00:05:20.370> one

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
great cardiac vein likewise there's one

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.810 
great cardiac vein likewise there's one
that<00:05:20.970> follows<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.600> back<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.110> heart<00:05:22.380> in

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
that follows the back of the heart in

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.090 
that follows the back of the heart in
the<00:05:23.820> interventricular<00:05:24.660> septum<00:05:25.140> at<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> bait

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
the interventricular septum at the bait

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.490 
the interventricular septum at the bait
back<00:05:26.460> of<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.700> heart<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:28.080> is<00:05:28.290> going

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
back of the heart and so this is going

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.130 
back of the heart and so this is going
to<00:05:28.620> be<00:05:28.770> referred<00:05:29.160> to<00:05:29.310> as<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:30.210> middle<00:05:30.600> cardiac

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
to be referred to as the middle cardiac

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.740 
to be referred to as the middle cardiac
vein<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.800> then<00:05:32.400> there's<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:32.850> small<00:05:33.120> cardiac

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
vein and then there's the small cardiac

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.560 
vein and then there's the small cardiac
vein<00:05:34.050> all<00:05:34.860> three<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.580> them<00:05:35.700> drain<00:05:36.030> into<00:05:36.390> this

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
vein all three of them drain into this

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.690 
vein all three of them drain into this
large<00:05:36.960> bulge<00:05:37.350> which<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:37.800> refer<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.310> as<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
large bulge which we refer to as the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.800 
large bulge which we refer to as the
coronary<00:05:39.300> sinus<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.950> coronary<00:05:41.460> sinus<00:05:41.810> now

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
coronary sinus the coronary sinus now

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.190 
coronary sinus the coronary sinus now
the<00:05:42.870> coronary<00:05:43.410> sinus<00:05:43.740> drains<00:05:45.200> deoxygenated

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
the coronary sinus drains deoxygenated

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.500 
the coronary sinus drains deoxygenated
blood<00:05:46.670> back<00:05:47.670> into<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:49.880> left<00:05:50.880> or<00:05:51.150> should<00:05:51.180> say

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
blood back into the left or should say

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.920 
blood back into the left or should say
the<00:05:51.660> right<00:05:52.020> side<00:05:52.320> of<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.530> heart<00:05:52.910> and<00:05:53.910> it<00:05:54.720> goes

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
the right side of the heart and it goes

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.820 
the right side of the heart and it goes
here<00:05:55.590> right<00:05:56.330> there<00:05:57.330> into<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:58.230> opening<00:05:58.650> of<00:05:58.770> the

here right there into the opening of the
coronary<00:05:59.250> sinus<00:05:59.550> as<00:05:59.970> it's<00:06:00.240> draining<00:06:00.780> into

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
coronary sinus as it's draining into

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.650

too that the great the small and the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.250 
too that the great the small and the
middle<00:06:10.290> cardiac<00:06:10.830> veins<00:06:11.180> seem<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.330> form<00:06:12.630> sign

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
middle cardiac veins seem to form sign

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.010 
middle cardiac veins seem to form sign
up<00:06:13.410> it's<00:06:13.560> kind<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.920> a<00:06:14.010> fancy<00:06:14.310> T<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.510> see<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:15.810> T

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
up it's kind of a fancy T you see the T

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.860 
up it's kind of a fancy T you see the T
of<00:06:16.770> course<00:06:17.040> all<00:06:17.280> of<00:06:17.310> them<00:06:17.550> are<00:06:17.700> going<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.210> have

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
of course all of them are going to have

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.850 
of course all of them are going to have
a<00:06:19.550> convergence<00:06:20.550> here<00:06:21.200> right<00:06:22.200> there<00:06:22.470> at<00:06:22.680> the

all<00:06:27.020> right<00:06:27.229> now<00:06:27.439> as<00:06:27.710> there<00:06:28.009> is<00:06:28.129> an<00:06:28.219> anterior

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
all right now as there is an anterior
