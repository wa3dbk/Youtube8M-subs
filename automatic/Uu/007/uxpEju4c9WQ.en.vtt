funds<00:02:24.120> magic<00:02:24.780> weed<00:02:25.020> codes<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.350> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
funds magic weed codes so on what this

funds magic weed codes so on what this
what<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> code<00:02:29.490> does<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.630> deletes<00:02:31.050> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
what that code does is it deletes it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.630 
what that code does is it deletes it
like<00:02:31.740> just<00:02:32.070> switches<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.090> UM<00:02:34.370> stuff<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
like just switches the UM stuff on it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.120 
like just switches the UM stuff on it
like<00:02:36.000> switches<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.780> weeds<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:38.459> uh<00:02:39.770> battles<00:02:40.770> or

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
you can take it off and you can make it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.690 
you can take it off and you can make it
all<00:02:44.820> clear<00:02:45.360> from<00:02:45.600> bells<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.830> once<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.550> the
