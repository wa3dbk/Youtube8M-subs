00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 where in minecraft welcome again 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.440
 this is my tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.510
 bakery is very cool by the way here 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.719
 I'm with my friend danger that is the one 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.420
 has taught me how to make this bakery 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.940
 and here we are going to let you know how 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.690
 it is done I hope you like it and what we are going 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.270
 to need is 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.440
 planks is for nothing else to do the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.630
 structure of the bakery I have 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.680
 very very really made the structure 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.310
 we need breads 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.560
 we're going to need a table of 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.820
 pressure either wood or stone that 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.430
 it's the same 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.230
 well we will put what is the like who 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.750
 says the wall of the bakery with 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.480
 planks that week after disappeared 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 here they are ok you can start to put it the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.550
 wall 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 it's a little desperate hurt so 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.000
 I think ok yes two holes one where is going to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 deposit the pay to make a loaf and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 we will go down a box although there is as well 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 they see it two pictures I do ok 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.100
 see how I put it and rhombus but I'm 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.530
 leaving a difference box above ok and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.860
 so you can see us I left a 4 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.860
 Of diference 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 and two down is all clear ok 1 2 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.080
 and a difference box in the part 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.730
 from above to make the bridge 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.050
 although I will put the pressure board with 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.150
 pressure table as they want to say a 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.200
 shortly before that stop there 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.840
 Water 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 and we will put the wiring and I will call you 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.899
 remember that if it is the name that you 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.820
 I'm going to cut a little bit this ok I'm going to 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.000
 put a dispenser there when you finish 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 so that from there throw the bread when 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.689
 do turn off with any other object 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 although it has already turned on let me put a bread 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.200
 so they see how how is it going to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.429
 throw the bread when you step on the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.460
 table 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.579
 ok has turned on 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.730
 it was very good it was very good 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.330
 we lose a little more so that they see 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.890
 perfect 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.080
 still pulling very well 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.830
 although what I 'm going to do here is break 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.119
 so that it falls better and I will place the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.069
 what is the water so that out there 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.140
 when it falls out of the other hole 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.500
 what we had done at the beginning 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.420
 there is the channel as it goes as you see the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.670
 water direction at the time of ignition 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.930
 is going to throw something, leave me a little bit 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.760
 of stones so that of earth so that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.700
 see throw the earth 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.890
 ok see how he has it and he goes by the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.350
 channel 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.750
 here we will put water also and there it is 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.620
 there stays the water bumps with a table 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.530
 of pressure 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.000
 at the moment we throw something they're going 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.599
 let's see I'm going to throw something out there for 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.599
 that they see 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.270
 and see how it gets here 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.640
 okay 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.090
 there is the moment to touch the table 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.420
 turn on the dispenser and have a bread and 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.200
 well basically that's just 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.599
 to go pick it up here 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.599
 and so it remains what bread is ok 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.080
 normally now now the only thing that 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.120
 we should do is fill a little 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.650
 the taste of each one of me nothing more 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.100
 filled on top by encimita for 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.750
 that now but rather to what is the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.570
 tutorial what the circuit matters is 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.980
 what matters here to my taste I 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.810
 here I'm going to raise the water a little 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.880
 that is very very down he 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.060
 and the bread red but I was looking for who 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.760
 it does it to the size that one wants me here 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.940
 I'm going to cut it a little bit and I'm going to upload a 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.940
 little bit 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.930
 in the water I need a plank 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.420
 retired is ok 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.310
 has been left now if the tutorial is what 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.379
 you so interested in my structure of a 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.900
 bakery has been very very very very bad 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.790
 I would say but well that does not matter every 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.640
 who remember that I'm not so good 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.210
 building 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.720
 this good, basically, basically now 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.700
 is this how it works in the bakery and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.530
 let advance little forgot to see 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.319
 the end of how the bakery has been 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.970
 already armed I repeat it is foolish my 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.920
 bakery just what interests me 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.080
 I'm going to show you the circuit of this 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.850
 how it works can enter a bit the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.430
 video to be seen 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.500
 well here I have already covered I have put a 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.860
 little roof to my bakery very ugly by 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.419
 true but what matters is the 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.210
 circuit here pulled one from earth I 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.550
 I collect a bread for one of land that is my 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.130
 price of bread that to each to his 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.950
 I like to see danger in its length that I do not see 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.260
 does a side or that there is good should come 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.570
 bread there is the bank good because that is 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.970
 the circuit of how to make a bakery 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.510
 I remember my game plan and I would take it 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.580
 the mx 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.650
 thank you very much danger and this is a 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.460
 tutorial more and I see them in the next 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.460
 see you later
