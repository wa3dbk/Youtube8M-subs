Conservatory of Music it looks like a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
Conservatory of Music it looks like a
red<00:01:02.460> microphone<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> microphone

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
red microphone and what the microphone

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
red microphone and what the microphone
sends<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.010> ultrasonic<00:01:05.640> sound<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.390> sound

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sends out is ultrasonic sound so sound

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
sends out is ultrasonic sound so sound
can't<00:01:06.869> hear<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.310> does<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> when

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
can't hear but what that does is when

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
can't hear but what that does is when
you<00:01:08.880> intersect<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.479> sound<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.590> goes<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you intersect that sound it goes back to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
you intersect that sound it goes back to
the<00:01:11.460> sound<00:01:11.729> beam<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.510> look<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> sort<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the sound beam which look to the sort of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
the sound beam which look to the sort of
