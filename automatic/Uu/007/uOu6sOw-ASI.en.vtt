00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 with sensors 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.490
 with a few sentences 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.990
 9 k 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.730

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.140
 very nice on the belgian coast became a kind of club on the beach last year 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.570

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.490

 you already have much and much more seven much more coastal leader already 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.559
 more often in the coming winter 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:25.509
 you end up with a lot of dutch people that they have the belgian coast i think it is 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 is because the Germans want to ruin it 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.379

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.859
