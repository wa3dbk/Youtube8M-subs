ball control is more than just holding
onto<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.580> balls<00:03:43.760> making<00:03:44.030> sure<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.360> if<00:03:44.450> you

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
do drop the ball you get on it or you

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.640 
do drop the ball you get on it or you
get<00:03:46.640> after<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.080> was<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.260> concern<00:03:48.500> for

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
get after it so that was a concern for

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.860 
get after it so that was a concern for
me<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:50.090> isn't<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.420> he<00:03:50.540> fumbled

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
me is that that it isn't that he fumbled

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.420 
me is that that it isn't that he fumbled
a<00:03:50.930> lot<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.440> just<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.769> when<00:03:51.890> he<00:03:51.950> did<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.400> was

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
a lot it's just that when he did it was

a lot it's just that when he did it was
at<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.670> bad<00:03:52.850> time<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.540> he<00:03:53.660> always<00:03:53.840> lost<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.730> well

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730

the<00:04:42.229> carries<00:04:42.680> he<00:04:42.949> would<00:04:43.039> still<00:04:43.250> split<00:04:43.550> time<00:04:43.789> in

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
the carries he would still split time in

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.180 
the carries he would still split time in
the<00:04:44.030> backfield<00:04:44.210> with<00:04:44.780> uh<00:04:45.229> with<00:04:45.349> joique<00:04:45.949> Bell

do need a guy who's going to be

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.700 
do need a guy who's going to be
efficient<00:05:02.630> with<00:05:02.659> the<00:05:02.840> carries<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.319> he<00:05:03.409> gets

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
efficient with the carries that he gets

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.589 
efficient with the carries that he gets
and<00:05:03.979> that's<00:05:04.610> something<00:05:04.849> that<00:05:05.000> Duke<00:05:05.270> really

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
and that's something that Duke really

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.240 
and that's something that Duke really
brings<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.050> table<00:05:06.229> he's<00:05:06.830> going<00:05:07.069> he's

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
brings to the table he's going he's

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.379 
brings to the table he's going he's
going<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.430> get<00:05:07.580> hit<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.759> few<00:05:07.940> times<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:08.360> the

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
going to get hit a few times in the

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.610 
going to get hit a few times in the
backfield<00:05:08.599> and<00:05:09.020> he'll<00:05:09.199> go<00:05:09.319> straight<00:05:09.380> down

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
backfield and he'll go straight down

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.710 
backfield and he'll go straight down
he's<00:05:10.520> not<00:05:10.639> going<00:05:10.819> to<00:05:10.909> break<00:05:11.030> tackles<00:05:11.270> very

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
he's not going to break tackles very

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.110 
he's not going to break tackles very
often<00:05:12.169> but<00:05:12.860> if<00:05:13.039> he<00:05:13.190> does<00:05:13.370> find<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.819> crease

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
often but if he does find that crease

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.659 
often but if he does find that crease
and<00:05:14.419> his<00:05:14.599> in<00:05:14.780> his<00:05:14.840> vision<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.409> excellent<00:05:16.039> so<00:05:16.610> if

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
and his in his vision is excellent so if

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.040 
and his in his vision is excellent so if
he<00:05:16.729> does<00:05:16.909> find<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.270> little<00:05:17.509> crease<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:17.960> he

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
he does find that little crease and he

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.570 
he does find that little crease and he
gets<00:05:18.229> a<00:05:18.319> little<00:05:18.409> opening<00:05:18.889> he's<00:05:19.280> going<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.490> be

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
gets a little opening he's going to be

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.080 
gets a little opening he's going to be
gone<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:21.530> let's<00:05:22.219> say<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.460> Lions<00:05:22.759> were<00:05:22.909> gonna

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
gone so let's say the Lions were gonna

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.879 
gone so let's say the Lions were gonna
go<00:05:23.210> after<00:05:23.360> Duke<00:05:23.659> in<00:05:23.840> this<00:05:23.990> draft<00:05:24.349> what<00:05:24.590> kind<00:05:24.830> of

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
go after Duke in this draft what kind of

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.529 
go after Duke in this draft what kind of
what<00:05:25.430> rounds<00:05:25.819> are<00:05:25.909> we<00:05:26.000> looking<00:05:26.270> at<00:05:26.360> him

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
what rounds are we looking at him

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.809 
what rounds are we looking at him
potentially<00:05:26.810> going<00:05:27.199> in<00:05:27.520> he<00:05:28.520> was<00:05:28.639> originally

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
potentially going in he was originally

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.399 
potentially going in he was originally
projected<00:05:29.150> in<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.539> third<00:05:29.750> round<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.229> think

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
projected in the third round I think

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.839 
projected in the third round I think
he's<00:05:30.500> going<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.680> go<00:05:30.830> up<00:05:31.009> after<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.370> combine<00:05:31.819> I

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
he's going to go up after the combine I

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.279 
he's going to go up after the combine I
think<00:05:32.210> he's<00:05:32.300> gonna<00:05:32.419> put<00:05:32.659> up<00:05:32.750> some<00:05:32.900> really<00:05:33.110> good

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
think he's gonna put up some really good

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.589 
think he's gonna put up some really good
numbers<00:05:33.710> especially<00:05:34.460> for<00:05:34.909> his<00:05:35.000> size<00:05:35.210> like<00:05:35.509> I

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
numbers especially for his size like I

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.629 
numbers especially for his size like I
said<00:05:35.750> he<00:05:35.870> is<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.990> smaller<00:05:36.349> back<00:05:36.680> but<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.490> think

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
said he is a smaller back but I think

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.860 
said he is a smaller back but I think
he's<00:05:37.729> gonna<00:05:37.819> put<00:05:38.060> up<00:05:38.150> really<00:05:38.330> good<00:05:38.509> numbers

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
he's gonna put up really good numbers

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.360 
he's gonna put up really good numbers
and<00:05:39.050> he's<00:05:39.289> probably<00:05:39.440> going<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:39.770> jump<00:05:40.039> up<00:05:40.190> to

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
and he's probably going to jump up to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.700 
and he's probably going to jump up to
the<00:05:40.849> early<00:05:41.180> second-round<00:05:41.569> mid<00:05:42.080> 2nd<00:05:42.440> round<00:05:42.590> on

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
the early second-round mid 2nd round on

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.559 
the early second-round mid 2nd round on
some<00:05:42.919> people's<00:05:43.219> boards<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.699> still<00:05:44.120> think<00:05:44.150> he

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
some people's boards I still think he

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.209 
some people's boards I still think he
falls<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.319> Lions<00:05:45.680> at<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.889> end<00:05:46.009> of<00:05:46.099> the

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
falls to the Lions at the end of the

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.249 
falls to the Lions at the end of the
second<00:05:46.520> round<00:05:46.550> I<00:05:46.969> think<00:05:47.539> there's<00:05:47.719> this<00:05:47.960> class

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
second round I think there's this class

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.980 
second round I think there's this class
is<00:05:48.469> deep<00:05:48.710> enough<00:05:48.830> and<00:05:49.190> he's<00:05:49.940> flying<00:05:50.240> just<00:05:50.599> just

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
is deep enough and he's flying just just

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.659 
is deep enough and he's flying just just
low<00:05:51.199> enough<00:05:51.229> under<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.800> radar<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.219> I<00:05:52.370> think

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
low enough under the radar that I think

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:53.700 
low enough under the radar that I think
that<00:05:52.729> it's<00:05:52.909> going<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.090> push<00:05:53.300> him<00:05:53.449> down<00:05:53.630> the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
that it's going to push him down the

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.230 
that it's going to push him down the
biggest<00:05:54.710> concern<00:05:55.190> for<00:05:55.430> me<00:05:55.580> is<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.909> actually

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
biggest concern for me is it actually

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.730 
biggest concern for me is it actually
has<00:05:56.330> nothing<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.719> do<00:05:56.840> with<00:05:56.930> Duke<00:05:57.169> it<00:05:57.440> has<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.680> do

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
has nothing to do with Duke it has to do

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.800 
has nothing to do with Duke it has to do
with<00:05:57.860> Todd<00:05:58.039> Gurley<00:05:58.520> which<00:05:59.120> if<00:05:59.270> Todd<00:05:59.449> Gurley

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
with Todd Gurley which if Todd Gurley

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.180 
with Todd Gurley which if Todd Gurley
falls<00:06:00.050> enough<00:06:00.440> then<00:06:00.680> that's<00:06:00.830> going<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.009> push

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
falls enough then that's going to push

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.129 
falls enough then that's going to push
those<00:06:01.370> other<00:06:01.550> backs<00:06:01.759> back<00:06:02.029> up<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.569> that's

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
those other backs back up and that's

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.629 
those other backs back up and that's
that's<00:06:03.440> going<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.770> make<00:06:04.130> make<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.490> a<00:06:04.550> little

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
that's going to make make it a little

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.010 
that's going to make make it a little
tougher<00:06:04.729> for<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> lines<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.630> get<00:06:05.750> him<00:06:05.840> in<00:06:05.930> a

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
tougher for the lines to get him in a

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.920 
tougher for the lines to get him in a
second<00:06:06.759> now<00:06:07.759> you<00:06:07.819> had<00:06:08.060> mentioned<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.509> if<00:06:08.690> Duke

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
Duke could have an immediate impact

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
for something to happen the Lions like I

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.029 
for something to happen the Lions like I
said<00:06:29.810> they<00:06:29.990> use<00:06:30.110> their<00:06:30.319> running<00:06:30.590> backs<00:06:30.740> in<00:06:30.919> the

said they use their running backs in the

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.499 
said they use their running backs in the
passing<00:06:31.430> game<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.580> lot<00:06:31.849> and<00:06:31.909> that's<00:06:32.330> where

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
passing game a lot and that's where

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:33.519 
passing game a lot and that's where
you're<00:06:32.630> really<00:06:32.810> going<00:06:32.930> to<00:06:33.020> see<00:06:33.139> them<00:06:33.229> start<00:06:33.500> to

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
you're really going to see them start to

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.129 
you're really going to see them start to
use<00:06:33.830> him<00:06:34.099> especially<00:06:34.909> on<00:06:35.240> first<00:06:35.630> down<00:06:35.870> the

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
use him especially on first down the

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.240 
use him especially on first down the
lines<00:06:36.319> are<00:06:36.500> one<00:06:36.589> of<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.740> one<00:06:36.949> of<00:06:37.009> the<00:06:37.070> few

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
lines are one of the one of the few

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.189 
lines are one of the one of the few
teams<00:06:37.370> that<00:06:37.550> pass<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.330> their<00:06:38.449> backs<00:06:38.630> on<00:06:38.960> first

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
teams that pass to their backs on first

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.980 
teams that pass to their backs on first
down<00:06:39.349> quite<00:06:39.680> often<00:06:39.909> in<00:06:40.909> Detroit<00:06:41.449> that<00:06:41.630> usually

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
down quite often in Detroit that usually

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.399 
down quite often in Detroit that usually
ended<00:06:42.139> up

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
ended up

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.299 
ended up
the<00:06:42.499> drop<00:06:42.709> pass<00:06:43.009> by<00:06:43.279> Reggie<00:06:44.259> but<00:06:45.259> a<00:06:45.769> guy<00:06:46.129> like

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:46.309 
the drop pass by Reggie but a guy like

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:48.129 
the drop pass by Reggie but a guy like
Duke<00:06:46.550> who's<00:06:47.059> much<00:06:47.239> more<00:06:47.449> sure-handed<00:06:47.899> and

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
Duke who's much more sure-handed and

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.439 
Duke who's much more sure-handed and
able<00:06:48.409> to<00:06:48.499> turn<00:06:48.679> it<00:06:48.709> up<00:06:48.860> field<00:06:49.159> quicker<00:06:49.429> I<00:06:49.729> think

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
able to turn it up field quicker I think

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.759 
able to turn it up field quicker I think
that<00:06:50.539> you'll<00:06:50.659> see<00:06:50.839> an<00:06:50.929> immediate<00:06:51.110> impact<00:06:51.559> in

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:51.769 
that you'll see an immediate impact in

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:53.679 
that you'll see an immediate impact in
the<00:06:51.860> passing<00:06:52.279> game<00:06:52.309> maybe<00:06:53.119> not<00:06:53.330> as<00:06:53.479> as<00:06:53.629> a

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
the passing game maybe not as as a

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.479 
the passing game maybe not as as a
medium<00:06:54.319> an<00:06:54.409> impact<00:06:54.739> in<00:06:54.860> the<00:06:54.979> running<00:06:55.279> game<00:06:55.429> I

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:55.489 
medium an impact in the running game I

00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:57.009 
medium an impact in the running game I
think<00:06:55.729> you'll<00:06:55.999> still<00:06:56.179> have<00:06:56.419> that<00:06:56.659> I<00:06:56.719> still

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:57.019 
think you'll still have that I still

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:59.409 
think you'll still have that I still
think<00:06:57.229> it'll<00:06:57.379> be<00:06:57.409> an<00:06:57.559> improvement<00:06:57.949> but<00:06:58.849> in<00:06:59.300> the

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
think it'll be an improvement but in the

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.790 
think it'll be an improvement but in the
passing<00:06:59.809> game<00:06:59.839> for<00:07:00.229> sure<00:07:00.409> you're<00:07:00.619> going<00:07:00.739> to

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
passing game for sure you're going to

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.859 
passing game for sure you're going to
see<00:07:00.949> a<00:07:00.979> lot<00:07:01.039> more<00:07:01.249> plays<00:07:02.149> behind<00:07:02.509> the<00:07:02.659> line<00:07:02.839> of
