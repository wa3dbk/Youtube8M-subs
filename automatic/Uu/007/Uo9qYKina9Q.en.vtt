00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.260 

so<00:00:04.859> we've<00:00:04.980> been<00:00:05.130> using<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.850> MakerBot

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
so we've been using the MakerBot

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.419 
so we've been using the MakerBot
replicator<00:00:06.480> 2<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> couple<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.950> months<00:00:08.099> now

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
replicator 2 for a couple of months now

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.950 
replicator 2 for a couple of months now
and<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.570> Kapton<00:00:09.990> tape<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.910> ceramic<00:00:11.910> came<00:00:12.780> off

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and the Kapton tape and ceramic came off

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 
and the Kapton tape and ceramic came off
of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.290> extruder<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.610> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
of the extruder and so we are going to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.540 
of the extruder and so we are going to
replace<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.870> today<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.440> go<00:00:17.220> over<00:00:17.400> how

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
replace that today and go over how

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.420 
replace that today and go over how
that's<00:00:17.789> done<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.869> emailed<00:00:19.289> MakerBot<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> they

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that's done we emailed MakerBot and they

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.179 
that's done we emailed MakerBot and they
actually<00:00:20.580> sent<00:00:21.090> us<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.570> new<00:00:21.810> piece<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.830> Kapton

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
actually sent us a new piece of Kapton

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.609 
actually sent us a new piece of Kapton
tape<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.210> holes<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.900> all<00:00:25.019> pre-cut

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
tape the holes are all pre-cut

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
tape the holes are all pre-cut
for<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> tools<00:00:26.490> we'll<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.480> normal<00:00:27.960> pair<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
for the tools we'll use a normal pair of

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.999 
for the tools we'll use a normal pair of
scissors<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.189> 2.5<00:00:30.029> millimeter<00:00:30.990> hex<00:00:31.260> wrench<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
a normal Philips screwdriver the first

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
a normal Philips screwdriver the first
thing<00:00:35.850> we're<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.870> remove<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
thing we're going to do is remove the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
thing we're going to do is remove the
filament<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> guide<00:00:39.210> tube<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
filament and the guide tube and that

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
filament and the guide tube and that
will<00:00:40.260> give<00:00:40.410> us<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.040> better<00:00:41.820> access

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
will give us a little bit better access

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.840 
will give us a little bit better access
to<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> nozzle<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.559> remove<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.820> old

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to the nozzle so we can remove the old

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.139 
to the nozzle so we can remove the old
Kapton<00:00:45.390> tape<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> replace<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.030> first

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Kapton tape and replace it so the first

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
Kapton tape and replace it so the first
thing<00:00:48.270> we're<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> we're<00:00:49.530> going

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.380 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> menu<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.210> will

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to go down to the menu and we will

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.650 
to go down to the menu and we will
select<00:00:51.600> utilities<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.820> then<00:00:53.820> change

select utilities and then change
filament<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.449> unload<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
filament and unload it will take just a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
filament and unload it will take just a
minute<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> printer<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.199> heat<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
minute for the printer to heat up and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.910 
minute for the printer to heat up and
then<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.640> unload<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> filament<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.260> LCD

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
then we can unload the filament the LCD

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.440 
then we can unload the filament the LCD
screen<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> MakerBot<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.090> actually

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
screen on the MakerBot will actually

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.600 
screen on the MakerBot will actually
guide<00:01:06.659> us<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.280> process<00:01:11.869> once<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
guide us through this process once the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
guide us through this process once the
MakerBot<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.119> heated<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:16.229> ahead<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
MakerBot is is heated go ahead and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
MakerBot is is heated go ahead and
remove<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> guide<00:01:17.340> tube<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.420> just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
remove the guide tube and then just

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
remove the guide tube and then just
gently<00:01:18.810> pull<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> filament<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
gently pull up on the filament and it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
gently pull up on the filament and it
should<00:01:20.790> come<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.380> once<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.619> done

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
should come right out once that's done

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
should come right out once that's done
you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.009> press<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> M<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.240> exit<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> process

you can press the M to exit the process

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
you can press the M to exit the process
before<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.640> started<00:01:27.030> we'll<00:01:27.930> actually

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
before we get started we'll actually

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.109 
before we get started we'll actually
turn<00:01:28.470> off<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.829> MakerBot<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.280> also<00:01:29.700> unplug

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
turn off the MakerBot and also unplug

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
turn off the MakerBot and also unplug
the<00:01:30.479> printer<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.290> always<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> good<00:01:31.710> idea

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the printer it's always a good idea

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950 
the printer it's always a good idea
whenever<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:32.790> working<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.659> printer

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
whenever you're working on your printer

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.160 
whenever you're working on your printer
to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.270> step<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.720> we're<00:01:36.930> going

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to do this the first step is we're going

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
to do this the first step is we're going
to<00:01:37.290> remove<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> Phillips<00:01:38.670> screws<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.479> hold

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to remove the Phillips screws that hold

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
to remove the Phillips screws that hold
the<00:01:40.350> active<00:01:40.710> cooling<00:01:41.100> duct<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> side<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the active cooling duct on the side of

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
the active cooling duct on the side of
the<00:01:42.450> extruder<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.100> two

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the extruder you can see there are two

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
the extruder you can see there are two
of<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> top<00:01:45.689> left<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of them on the top left and on the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080 
of them on the top left and on the
bottom<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.430> we'll<00:01:47.549> remove<00:01:47.850> both<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
bottom right so we'll remove both of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
bottom right so we'll remove both of
those<00:01:48.470> once<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> active<00:01:50.009> cooling<00:01:50.189> duct<00:01:50.520> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
those once the active cooling duct is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
those once the active cooling duct is
removed<00:01:51.090> we'll<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.479> let<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> hang<00:01:52.049> by<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
removed we'll just let it hang by the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.160 
removed we'll just let it hang by the
wires<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:54.149> reason<00:01:54.360> why<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.600> take<00:01:54.750> active

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
wires here the reason why we take active

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
wires here the reason why we take active
cooling<00:01:55.350> duct<00:01:55.740> off<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.189> it'll<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.549> allow

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
cooling duct off is it'll actually allow

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.959 
cooling duct off is it'll actually allow
us<00:01:57.600> access<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.469> bolts<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> bottom<00:01:59.850> of

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
us access to the bolts on the bottom of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
us access to the bolts on the bottom of
the<00:02:00.060> extruder<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> remove<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the extruder so we can remove the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.480 
the extruder so we can remove the
extruder<00:02:01.950> from<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:03.450> gantry<00:02:04.280> before<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.340> get

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
extruder from the gantry before you get

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.950 
extruder from the gantry before you get
started<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.450> work<00:02:06.600> around<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
started and as you work around the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.919 
started and as you work around the
extruder<00:02:07.439> make<00:02:07.619> sure<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.729> hot<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
extruder make sure that it's not hot so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.520 
extruder make sure that it's not hot so
it<00:02:10.619> doesn't<00:02:10.920> burn<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
it doesn't burn you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.280 
it doesn't burn you
you<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.580> see<00:02:12.760> there<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.209> two<00:02:13.450> bolts<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:14.170> on

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you can see there are two bolts one on

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.050 
you can see there are two bolts one on
the<00:02:14.380> right<00:02:14.590> side<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.069> extruder<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.550> one

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the right side of the extruder and one

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.910 
the right side of the extruder and one
on<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> left<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.200> will<00:02:17.290> take<00:02:17.500> both<00:02:17.740> of

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
on the left and we will take both of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.850 
on the left and we will take both of
those<00:02:18.100> out<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.209> their<00:02:19.360> extruder<00:02:20.170> will<00:02:20.350> we

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
those out and so their extruder will we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.350 
those out and so their extruder will we
can<00:02:21.010> lift<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.280> extruder<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.880> off<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
can lift the extruder right off of the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.010 
can lift the extruder right off of the
gantry<00:02:22.750> at<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.080> point<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.709> we'll<00:02:24.459> use<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
gantry at that point and we'll use the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.290 
gantry at that point and we'll use the
2.5<00:02:26.020> millimeter<00:02:26.650> hex<00:02:26.920> wrench<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.520> remove<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
2.5 millimeter hex wrench to remove the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.180 
2.5 millimeter hex wrench to remove the
two<00:02:28.480> bolts<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.319> now<00:02:29.530> we'll<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:29.860> take<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
two bolts and now we'll just take the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.910 
two bolts and now we'll just take the
entire<00:02:30.459> extruder<00:02:31.150> assembly<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.230> lift<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.800> up

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
entire extruder assembly and lift it up

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.010 
entire extruder assembly and lift it up
off<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.250> gantry<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.760> sit<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.480> up<00:02:34.569> on<00:02:34.720> its<00:02:34.900> side

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
off the gantry and sit it up on its side

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.260 
off the gantry and sit it up on its side
and<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.459> look<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:36.910> sure<00:02:37.090> there's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
and you can look and make sure there's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.900 
and you can look and make sure there's
no<00:02:37.510> more<00:02:37.750> Kapton<00:02:38.290> tape<00:02:38.319> or<00:02:38.830> insulation<00:02:39.370> stuck

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
no more Kapton tape or insulation stuck

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.180 
no more Kapton tape or insulation stuck
up<00:02:40.090> around<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:41.140> nozzle<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.920> need<00:02:42.069> to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
up around the nozzle that you need to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.430 
up around the nozzle that you need to
remove<00:02:42.489> before<00:02:43.480> putting<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> new<00:02:44.019> Kapton

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
remove before putting the new Kapton

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.490 
remove before putting the new Kapton
tape<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> Kapton<00:02:47.080> tape<00:02:47.140> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
tape on so this is the Kapton tape and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.380 
tape on so this is the Kapton tape and
insulation<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.220> MakerBot<00:02:48.700> sent<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.239> can

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
insulation that MakerBot sent you can

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.150 
insulation that MakerBot sent you can
see<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:49.750> pre-cut<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> two<00:02:50.620> holes<00:02:50.890> and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
see it's pre-cut with the two holes and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.870 
see it's pre-cut with the two holes and
also<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.610> slit<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.040> we'll<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.700> able<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
also the slit here and we'll be able to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.210 
also the slit here and we'll be able to
use<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.540> wrap<00:02:55.720> right<00:02:55.989> around<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.920> nozzle

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
use this to wrap right around the nozzle

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.729 
use this to wrap right around the nozzle
we'll<00:02:58.180> take<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.569> Kapton<00:02:59.080> tape<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.709> can

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
we'll take the Kapton tape and you can

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.850 
we'll take the Kapton tape and you can
see<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.190> one<00:03:00.370> side<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.810> hole<00:03:02.410> will

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
see the one side with the hole will

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.729 
see the one side with the hole will
actually<00:03:03.280> fit<00:03:03.519> around<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:04.530> thermal<00:03:05.530> barrier

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
actually fit around the thermal barrier

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.009 
actually fit around the thermal barrier
and<00:03:06.190> then<00:03:07.060> we'll<00:03:07.209> take<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.660> we'll<00:03:07.720> wrap<00:03:07.989> it

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
and then we'll take it and we'll wrap it

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.780 
and then we'll take it and we'll wrap it
around<00:03:08.290> here<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:08.950> see<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> bottom<00:03:09.519> hole

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
around here and you see the bottom hole

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.870 
around here and you see the bottom hole
fits<00:03:10.600> over<00:03:10.900> top<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.410> nozzle<00:03:11.860> but<00:03:12.550> notice

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
fits over top of the nozzle but notice

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.490 
fits over top of the nozzle but notice
there<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> set<00:03:13.540> screw<00:03:13.810> next<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.350> hole

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
there is a set screw next to the hole

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.250 
there is a set screw next to the hole
and<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:14.890> I'm<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.220> push<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.239> there<00:03:16.959> isn't

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
and so I'm going to push and there isn't

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.780 
and so I'm going to push and there isn't
a<00:03:17.290> hole<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.950> set<00:03:18.190> screw<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.579> I'll<00:03:18.670> just

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
a hole for that set screw so I'll just

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.789 
a hole for that set screw so I'll just
push<00:03:18.970> hard<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.390> Kapton<00:03:19.750> tape<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.230> mark<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
push hard on the Kapton tape to mark the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.979 
push hard on the Kapton tape to mark the
position<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:21.940> set<00:03:22.180> screw<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.570> I<00:03:22.630> can<00:03:22.840> cut

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
position of that set screw so I can cut

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.990 
position of that set screw so I can cut
it<00:03:23.110> out<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:24.010> will<00:03:24.190> allow<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.400> set<00:03:24.760> screw

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
it out and that will allow the set screw

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.190 
it out and that will allow the set screw
to<00:03:25.030> come<00:03:25.329> through<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.440> Kapton<00:03:27.010> tape<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
to come through the Kapton tape and the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.650 
to come through the Kapton tape and the
insulation<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.340> see<00:03:30.519> now<00:03:30.670> I've<00:03:30.850> cut

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
insulation so you can see now I've cut

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.740 
insulation so you can see now I've cut
the<00:03:31.780> hole<00:03:31.989> for<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.860> set<00:03:33.250> screw<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.880> we'll<00:03:34.600> now

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the hole for the set screw and we'll now

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.770 
the hole for the set screw and we'll now
put<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.590> back<00:03:35.799> around<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.880> thermal<00:03:37.360> core<00:03:37.600> and

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
put it back around the thermal core and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.500 
put it back around the thermal core and
it<00:03:37.870> should<00:03:38.049> fit<00:03:38.260> well

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.380 

so<00:03:47.200> we'll<00:03:47.379> remove<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.040> backing<00:03:48.340> from<00:03:48.610> the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
so we'll remove the backing from the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.809 
so we'll remove the backing from the
Kapton<00:03:49.959> tape<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:51.040> wrap<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.549> all<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.700> way

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
Kapton tape and then wrap it all the way

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
stick on the other side so now that we

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.479 
stick on the other side so now that we
have<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.330> new<00:04:04.540> Kapton<00:04:05.080> tape<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.620> insulation

on we'll tip the extruder back on and

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.089 
on we'll tip the extruder back on and
sit<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.120> down<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.629> gantry<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.530> then<00:04:11.920> we'll

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
sit it down in the gantry and then we'll

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.860 
sit it down in the gantry and then we'll
be<00:04:12.220> able<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.430> put<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> bolts<00:04:13.060> back<00:04:13.150> through
