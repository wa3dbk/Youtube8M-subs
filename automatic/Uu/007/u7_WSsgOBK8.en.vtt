00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
this series i have to say would be that

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.100 
this series i have to say would be that
it<00:04:21.160> was<00:04:21.250> only<00:04:21.400> three<00:04:21.670> seasons<00:04:22.090> long<00:04:22.300> this

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
it was only three seasons long this

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.050 
it was only three seasons long this
should<00:04:23.350> have<00:04:23.470> got<00:04:23.590> four<00:04:23.830> seasons<00:04:24.400> granted

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
should have got four seasons granted

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.670 
should have got four seasons granted
they<00:04:25.240> did<00:04:25.420> give<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.780> season<00:04:25.990> finale<00:04:26.470> and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
they did give it a season finale and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.030 
they did give it a season finale and
epilogue<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.640> justice<00:04:28.030> league<00:04:28.300> but<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:29.650> just

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
epilogue and justice league but it just

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.260 
epilogue and justice league but it just
seems<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:31.390> ended<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.620> abruptly<00:04:33.270> there

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680
