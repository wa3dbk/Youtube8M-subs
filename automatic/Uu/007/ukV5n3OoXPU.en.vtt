look pretty under um any kind of light
gold<00:01:42.150> eyeshadow<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:45.530> then<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.920> went<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

couldn't believe they had that I was

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.590 
couldn't believe they had that I was
like<00:03:23.100> because<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.340> really<00:03:24.790> wanted<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.239> when

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.260 
get any dazzle glasses from that
collection<00:03:59.080> last<00:03:59.620> year<00:03:59.920> because<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:01.090> was

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
collection last year because that was

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.479 
collection last year because that was
actually<00:04:01.750> when<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:01.959> first<00:04:02.350> started<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.920> getting

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
actually when I first started in getting

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.410 
actually when I first started in getting
into<00:04:03.700> Mac<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.870> bought<00:04:05.520> one<00:04:06.520> of<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.730> blushes

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
into Mac and I bought one of the blushes

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.140 
into Mac and I bought one of the blushes
and<00:04:08.200> i<00:04:09.130> think<00:04:09.610> i<00:04:09.730> got<00:04:09.880> an<00:04:10.060> msf<00:04:10.690> from<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.380> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
and i think i got an msf from that and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.360 
and i think i got an msf from that and
um<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.989> i<00:04:14.019> didn't<00:04:14.230> get<00:04:14.320> any<00:04:14.470> dazzle<00:04:14.950> glasses

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
um so i didn't get any dazzle glasses

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.780 
um so i didn't get any dazzle glasses
from<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.700> collection<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.540> anyways<00:04:16.989> they<00:04:17.230> had

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
from that collection so anyways they had

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.110 
from that collection so anyways they had
Shazam<00:04:19.320> which<00:04:20.320> looks<00:04:20.620> like<00:04:20.710> this<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.370> it's

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
Shazam which looks like this and it's

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.920 
Shazam which looks like this and it's
silver<00:04:22.750> with<00:04:23.470> silver<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.310> red

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
silver with silver and red

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.749 
silver with silver and red
glitter<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:30.530> figured<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.860> this

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
glitter in it and I figured that this

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.529 
glitter in it and I figured that this
would<00:04:33.090> probably<00:04:33.419> go<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:35.150> thought<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.360> would

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
would probably go I thought this would

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.990 
would probably go I thought this would
probably<00:04:36.750> look<00:04:37.229> really<00:04:37.289> pretty<00:04:37.919> over<00:04:38.550> maybe

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
probably look really pretty over maybe

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.090 
probably look really pretty over maybe
like<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:40.280> pale<00:04:41.280> pink<00:04:41.990> lipstick<00:04:42.990> or<00:04:43.289> even<00:04:44.009> a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
like a a pale pink lipstick or even a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.050 
like a a pale pink lipstick or even a
medium<00:04:44.490> pink<00:04:44.729> lipstick<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.509> don't<00:04:46.080> think<00:04:46.169> that

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
medium pink lipstick I don't think that

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.390 
medium pink lipstick I don't think that
yeah<00:04:48.060> it's<00:04:48.449> it<00:04:48.720> it's<00:04:49.110> supposed<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.590> be<00:04:49.650> silver

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
yeah it's it it's supposed to be silver

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.219 
yeah it's it it's supposed to be silver
and<00:04:50.550> red<00:04:50.729> glitter<00:04:51.060> but<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.690> don't<00:04:51.960> think<00:04:52.080> it's

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
and red glitter but I don't think it's

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.950 
and red glitter but I don't think it's
really<00:04:52.470> going<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.680> show<00:04:52.889> up<00:04:53.100> as<00:04:53.340> red<00:04:53.960> glitter

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
really going to show up as red glitter

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.879 
really going to show up as red glitter
it<00:04:55.350> really<00:04:55.650> just<00:04:55.949> looks<00:04:56.220> like<00:04:56.430> silver<00:04:57.889> lip

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
it really just looks like silver lip

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.430 
it really just looks like silver lip
gloss<00:04:59.160> with<00:04:59.520> silver<00:04:59.940> glitter<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:00.930> this

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
gloss with silver glitter in it so this

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.050 
gloss with silver glitter in it so this
would<00:05:01.650> probably<00:05:01.830> look<00:05:02.130> really<00:05:02.190> pretty<00:05:02.639> /

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
would probably look really pretty /

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.600 
would probably look really pretty /
purple<00:05:03.330> lipstick<00:05:03.870> too<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.380> pale<00:05:04.770> purple

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
purple lipstick too like a pale purple

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.189 
purple lipstick too like a pale purple
lipstick<00:05:06.180> or<00:05:06.479> a<00:05:06.509> pale<00:05:07.020> pink<00:05:08.599> and<00:05:09.599> actually<00:05:09.930> I

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
lipstick or a pale pink and actually I

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.589
