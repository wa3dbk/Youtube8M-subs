welcome<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> rock<00:00:11.849> filled<00:00:12.210> tutorial

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
welcome to the rock filled tutorial

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
welcome to the rock filled tutorial
we'll<00:00:13.710> look<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> few<00:00:14.400> different<00:00:14.639> ways<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
we'll look at a few different ways to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.410 
we'll look at a few different ways to
create<00:00:15.839> large<00:00:16.770> numbers<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.420> randomly

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
create large numbers of randomly

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.109 
create large numbers of randomly
generated<00:00:19.320> objects<00:00:19.920> which<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.939> all

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
generated objects which are all

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.220 
generated objects which are all
different<00:00:22.850> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.539> want<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.900> end<00:00:25.050> up

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
different this is what we want to end up

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.620 
different this is what we want to end up
with<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> end<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> tutorial<00:00:26.630> it's

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
with at the end of the tutorial it's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470 
with at the end of the tutorial it's
basically<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.289> field<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.890> rocks<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> randomly

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
basically a field of rocks on a randomly

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.799 
basically a field of rocks on a randomly
generated<00:00:30.949> ground<00:00:31.949> plane<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.579> each<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
generated ground plane and each of the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
generated ground plane and each of the
rocks<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.290> also<00:00:34.620> generated<00:00:35.250> randomly<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
rocks is also generated randomly and is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.340 
rocks is also generated randomly and is
unique<00:00:36.920> we<00:00:37.920> also<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.550> colors<00:00:39.390> assigned<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
unique we also have colors assigned to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
unique we also have colors assigned to
each<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.190> lights<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> center<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> each

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
each of the lights at the center of each

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.709 
each of the lights at the center of each
rock<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.910> we'll<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.539> can

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
rock and we'll see how that we can

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
rock and we'll see how that we can
control<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.230> semi<00:00:46.620> randomly<00:00:47.250> where<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
control that semi randomly where we

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
control that semi randomly where we
control<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> color<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.410> select<00:00:49.950> randomly

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
control the color but we select randomly

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
control the color but we select randomly
which<00:00:50.760> rock<00:00:51.120> has<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.110> specific<00:00:52.620> colors<00:00:54.050> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
which rock has the specific colors this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
which rock has the specific colors this

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
in this tutorial and now i have a group

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.390 
in this tutorial and now i have a group
called<00:01:26.159> group<00:01:26.909> 1<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.200> i'll<00:01:28.290> rename<00:01:28.590> group<00:01:28.920> 1<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
called group 1 so i'll rename group 1 to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
called group 1 so i'll rename group 1 to
be<00:01:29.780> scatter<00:01:31.490> points<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:33.479> use<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> space<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
be scatter points don't use a space it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.429 
be scatter points don't use a space it
won't<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> use<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.280> space<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
won't like it if you use the space and

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
won't like it if you use the space and
if<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.829> drag<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.310> slightly<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
if I just drag down slightly in the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
if I just drag down slightly in the
interface<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.290> put

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
interface here you can see that it's put

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
interface here you can see that it's put
the<00:01:40.680> numbers<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.640> primitives<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> other

is mentioned in the list here then it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.050 
is mentioned in the list here then it's

part of the group down on the scatter if

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.249 
part of the group down on the scatter if
I<00:01:54.240> select<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> under<00:01:55.350> group<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.909> choose

I select that under group I can choose

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.469 
I select that under group I can choose
scatter<00:01:58.259> points<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.000> now<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.210> only

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
scatter points and now it's only

I<00:02:09.390> drew<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.979> turn<00:02:11.190> up<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> number

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
I drew that and if I turn up the number

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.700 
I drew that and if I turn up the number

thousand<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:15.690> where<00:02:16.020> I

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
thousand you can really see where I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.640 
thousand you can really see where I
selected<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> polygons<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.260> where<00:02:19.500> the

displacements but the penalty is not as

heavy as some other renderers so if you

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
can use true displacements you'll find

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.860 
can use true displacements you'll find
that<00:04:11.160> generally<00:04:11.610> speaking<00:04:11.910> they'll<00:04:12.720> look

that generally speaking they'll look

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.490 
that generally speaking they'll look
better<00:04:13.080> than<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:14.100> bump<00:04:14.820> map<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:16.230> played

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
better than just a bump map and I played

with<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.220> found<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.730> value<00:04:18.180> an

RGB of point 5.5 and point for one

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.360 

gave<00:04:26.980> me<00:04:27.190> just<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.880> hint<00:04:28.270> of<00:04:28.650> kind<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.830> sickly

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
gave me just a hint of kind of a sickly

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.810 
gave me just a hint of kind of a sickly

is hidden by the displaced rock and part
of<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.300> exposed<00:05:37.560> so<00:05:38.560> instead<00:05:39.040> of<00:05:39.100> having

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
of it is exposed so instead of having

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.610 
of it is exposed so instead of having
the<00:05:39.550> entire<00:05:39.640> Rock<00:05:40.120> glow<00:05:40.479> I<00:05:40.510> have<00:05:40.840> sections<00:05:41.410> of

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
the entire Rock glow I have sections of

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.980 
the entire Rock glow I have sections of
the<00:05:41.740> rock<00:05:41.950> glowing<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:42.580> my<00:05:43.300> opinion<00:05:43.570> this<00:05:43.810> is<00:05:43.870> a

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
the rock glowing in my opinion this is a

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.990 
the rock glowing in my opinion this is a
lot<00:05:44.200> more<00:05:44.380> interesting<00:05:44.710> visually<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.610> can

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
lot more interesting visually you can

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.760 
lot more interesting visually you can
take<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.300> look<00:05:46.479> at<00:05:46.630> some<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> other<00:05:46.960> areas

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
take a look at some of the other areas

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.560 
take a look at some of the other areas
here<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.340> can<00:05:48.490> see<00:05:48.700> that<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.060> rocks<00:05:49.300> have

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
here you can see that the rocks have

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.280 
here you can see that the rocks have
glowing<00:05:49.840> bits<00:05:50.520> inside<00:05:51.520> themselves<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:53.260> are

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
glowing bits inside themselves that are

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.740 
glowing bits inside themselves that are
casting<00:05:53.860> light<00:05:54.070> out<00:05:54.310> of<00:05:54.490> them<00:05:54.640> so<00:05:54.850> I

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
casting light out of them so I

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.570 
casting light out of them so I
personally<00:05:56.200> find<00:05:56.620> this<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:56.890> more<00:05:57.100> visually

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
personally find this a more visually

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.060 
personally find this a more visually
interesting<00:05:57.630> result<00:05:58.630> where<00:05:59.020> instead<00:05:59.800> of<00:05:59.860> the

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
interesting result where instead of the

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.010 
interesting result where instead of the
entire<00:06:00.340> Rock<00:06:00.640> glowing<00:06:01.060> it's<00:06:01.510> almost<00:06:01.780> like

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
entire Rock glowing it's almost like

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.520 
entire Rock glowing it's almost like
there's<00:06:02.260> part<00:06:02.919> of<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.190> rock<00:06:03.400> that's<00:06:03.700> exposed

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
there's part of the rock that's exposed

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.260 
there's part of the rock that's exposed
has<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.560> glow<00:06:05.979> to<00:06:06.040> it<00:06:06.280> that's<00:06:06.669> lighting<00:06:07.030> up<00:06:07.150> the

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
has a glow to it that's lighting up the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.530 
has a glow to it that's lighting up the
environment<00:06:07.540> around<00:06:09.000> for<00:06:10.000> those<00:06:10.150> of<00:06:10.300> you<00:06:10.419> who

environment around for those of you who

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.120 
environment around for those of you who
got<00:06:10.720> through<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.050> there<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.440> go<00:06:11.590> you<00:06:11.650> can<00:06:11.979> see

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
got through it there you go you can see

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.830 
got through it there you go you can see
there's<00:06:12.310> a<00:06:12.370> few<00:06:12.580> little<00:06:12.610> sparkles<00:06:13.300> in<00:06:13.540> certain

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
there's a few little sparkles in certain

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.920 
there's a few little sparkles in certain
areas<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.440> you<00:06:14.530> might<00:06:14.800> have<00:06:14.919> to<00:06:14.979> turn<00:06:15.370> up<00:06:15.580> the

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
areas so you might have to turn up the

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.180 
areas so you might have to turn up the
sampling<00:06:16.930> slightly<00:06:17.440> to<00:06:17.740> get<00:06:17.890> rid<00:06:18.010> of<00:06:18.070> those

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
sampling slightly to get rid of those

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.130 
sampling slightly to get rid of those
sparkles<00:06:18.729> but<00:06:19.270> we<00:06:19.450> have<00:06:19.660> quite<00:06:19.990> an

sparkles but we have quite an

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.190 
sparkles but we have quite an
