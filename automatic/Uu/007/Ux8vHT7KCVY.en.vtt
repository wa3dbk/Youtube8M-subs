job<00:00:58.410> indeed<00:00:58.800> lots<00:00:59.670> of<00:01:00.020> primary<00:01:01.020> research<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
job indeed lots of primary research and

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.690 
job indeed lots of primary research and
then<00:01:02.670> trying<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.720> of<00:01:03.810> write<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.470> each<00:01:05.340> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
then trying to kind of write up each and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
then trying to kind of write up each and
every<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.300> flavor<00:01:06.540> combinations<00:01:07.140> I

anything interesting or unusual that was
coming<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> made<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> enormous

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
coming up and so I made this enormous

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.960 
coming up and so I made this enormous
master<00:01:51.990> list<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> went<00:01:53.400> about<00:01:53.580> kind

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
master list and then I went about kind

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.610 
master list and then I went about kind
of<00:01:54.060> writing<00:01:54.270> about<00:01:54.630> something<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.409> each

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
of writing about something about each

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.320 
of writing about something about each
one<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> them<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.030> would<00:01:57.180> be

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
one of them so some of it would be

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.899 
one of them so some of it would be
science<00:01:58.200> some<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.620> some<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> its<00:01:59.190> historical

and flavor you can pull those things

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.590 
and flavor you can pull those things
apart<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.290> taste<00:02:39.650> with<00:02:39.950> Norman<00:02:40.220> EV<00:02:40.459> salt<00:02:41.030> sweet

of<00:02:45.350> something<00:02:45.709> else<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.130> what<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
of something else it's what you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.740 
of something else it's what you
experience<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.690> your<00:02:47.750> olfactory<00:02:49.420> bulb<00:02:50.420> it's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
experience in your olfactory bulb it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.810 
experience in your olfactory bulb it's
much<00:02:50.989> more<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.560> combination<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:52.310> what's<00:02:52.610> going

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
much more a combination of what's going

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.850 
much more a combination of what's going
on<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.180> your<00:02:53.360> nose<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:54.320> your<00:02:54.500> taste<00:02:54.739> buds

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
on in your nose and in your taste buds

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.850 
on in your nose and in your taste buds
so<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.520> will<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:56.420> flavor<00:02:57.230> note<00:02:57.530> would<00:02:57.709> be

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
so that will be a flavor note would be

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.860 
so that will be a flavor note would be
something<00:02:58.250> more<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:58.820> things<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.690> see

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
something more like things that you see

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.390 
something more like things that you see
on<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.080> back<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.560> bottle<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.890> wine<00:03:00.950> like

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
on the back of a bottle of wine like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.350 
on the back of a bottle of wine like
woody<00:03:01.670> or<00:03:01.970> citrusy<00:03:02.540> or<00:03:02.780> zesty<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.670> even<00:03:05.090> then

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
woody or citrusy or zesty but even then

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.470 
woody or citrusy or zesty but even then
there's<00:03:05.720> only<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.080> kind<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:07.250> small<00:03:08.120> group<00:03:08.150> of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
there's only a kind of a small group of

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.150 
there's only a kind of a small group of
words<00:03:08.690> perhaps<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.230> describe<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.739> thing<00:03:09.950> so

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
words perhaps to describe that thing so

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.650 
words perhaps to describe that thing so
then<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.489> start<00:03:10.820> looking<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.270> different<00:03:11.630> ways

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
then I start looking at different ways

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.710 
then I start looking at different ways
of<00:03:11.959> expressing<00:03:12.440> flavor<00:03:12.920> by<00:03:13.610> using<00:03:14.000> metaphor

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
of expressing flavor by using metaphor

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.600 
of expressing flavor by using metaphor
or<00:03:14.989> actually<00:03:15.560> talking<00:03:15.920> about<00:03:16.130> the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
or actually talking about the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.910 
or actually talking about the
personality<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.959> flavor<00:03:18.200> suggests<00:03:18.799> to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
personality that the flavor suggests to

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.550 
personality that the flavor suggests to
me<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.880> when<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.269> start<00:03:20.600> thinking<00:03:21.170> about

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
me and when you start thinking about

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.800 
me and when you start thinking about
flavor<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.310> kind<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.820> way<00:03:23.060> what<00:03:23.660> would

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
flavor in that kind of way what would

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.750 
flavor in that kind of way what would
this<00:03:23.989> what<00:03:24.680> would<00:03:24.799> this<00:03:24.890> flavor<00:03:25.190> be<00:03:25.400> like<00:03:25.580> if

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
this what would this flavor be like if

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.720 
this what would this flavor be like if
it<00:03:25.880> was<00:03:26.000> piece<00:03:26.269> of<00:03:26.450> music<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:28.250> you're<00:03:28.459> talking

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
it was piece of music and you're talking

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.490 
it was piece of music and you're talking
about<00:03:28.850> combination<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.019> way<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.200> have<00:03:30.350> a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
about combination so in a way you have a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.210 
about combination so in a way you have a
slight<00:03:30.920> world<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:32.560> language<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.769> metaphor

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
slight world of language and metaphor

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.670 
slight world of language and metaphor
and<00:03:34.340> simile<00:03:34.750> available<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.080> then<00:03:36.530> it

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
and simile available to you then it
