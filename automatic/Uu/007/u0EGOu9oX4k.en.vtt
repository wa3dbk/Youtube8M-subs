nothing I don't even know what that
tastes<00:03:10.720> like

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
tastes like

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.730 
tastes like
I<00:03:11.230> mean<00:03:11.410> it's<00:03:11.740> not<00:03:11.860> bad<00:03:12.160> but<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:14.230> not<00:03:14.470> really

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
I mean it's not bad but it's not really

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.440 
I mean it's not bad but it's not really
taste<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:15.940> just<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.390> know<00:03:16.710> eat<00:03:17.710> it<00:03:17.890> for<00:03:18.040> food

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
taste it's just you know eat it for food

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.720 
taste it's just you know eat it for food
for<00:03:19.450> protein<00:03:19.900> sake<00:03:22.080> do<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.170> know<00:03:23.260> with<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
for protein sake do you know with the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.650 
for protein sake do you know with the
pepperoni<00:03:24.730> thing<00:03:26.250> because<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.730> know<00:03:27.820> if<00:03:28.540> you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
pepperoni thing because you know if you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.760 
pepperoni thing because you know if you
don't<00:03:28.780> know<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.050> something<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.470> you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
don't know what something is you

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.589 
don't know what something is you
probably<00:03:30.130> didn't<00:03:30.580> eat<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.150> yeah

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.580 

okay<00:03:39.769> that's<00:03:40.769> actually<00:03:41.069> not<00:03:41.189> too<00:03:41.370> bad<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:42.590> think

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
okay that's actually not too bad I think

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.489 
okay that's actually not too bad I think
what<00:03:43.769> they're<00:03:43.889> going<00:03:44.069> for<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.939> I<00:03:45.439> don't<00:03:46.439> know

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:46.499 
what they're going for is I don't know

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:53.649 
what they're going for is I don't know
white<00:03:46.709> pudding<00:03:47.540> or<00:03:48.540> bacon<00:03:49.370> maybe<00:03:50.370> mixed<00:03:50.670> Lee<00:03:50.790> -

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.149 

yeah<00:03:54.659> that's<00:03:55.109> probably<00:03:55.290> best<00:03:55.680> thing<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.099> the

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
yeah that's probably best thing on the

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.309 
yeah that's probably best thing on the
plate<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.639> far<00:03:56.849> if<00:03:57.569> they've<00:03:57.750> already<00:03:57.840> done<00:03:58.260> a

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
plate so far if they've already done a

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.069 
plate so far if they've already done a
job<00:03:58.620> with<00:03:58.799> whatever<00:03:59.489> mushroom<00:04:00.269> type<00:04:00.689> thing<00:04:00.900> is

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
job with whatever mushroom type thing is

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.959 
job with whatever mushroom type thing is
I<00:04:01.379> mean<00:04:01.530> they<00:04:01.620> can't<00:04:01.829> really<00:04:02.040> go<00:04:02.219> wrong<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.579> mean

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
I mean they can't really go wrong I mean

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.369 
I mean they can't really go wrong I mean
mushrooms<00:04:03.480> are<00:04:03.569> small<00:04:03.780> enough<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.079> fit<00:04:04.200> into

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
mushrooms are small enough to fit into

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.959 
mushrooms are small enough to fit into
the<00:04:04.530> account<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.040> they<00:04:05.189> should<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.909> know

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
the account so they should be you know

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:16.249 
the account so they should be you know
okay<00:04:13.549> okay<00:04:14.549> that's<00:04:15.540> probably<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.229> only

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
okay okay that's probably the only

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.599 
okay okay that's probably the only
natural<00:04:16.859> food<00:04:17.039> they've<00:04:17.220> got<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.489> there

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
natural food they've got in there

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.069 
natural food they've got in there
everything's<00:04:17.910> probably<00:04:18.060> promised<00:04:18.479> sbar<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
everything's probably promised sbar the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.960 
everything's probably promised sbar the
mushrooms

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
mushrooms

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.700 
mushrooms
maybe<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> beans<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:22.259> have<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.500> actually

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
maybe the beans but you have to actually

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.990 
maybe the beans but you have to actually
delve<00:04:23.220> into<00:04:23.430> those<00:04:23.610> by<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.000> sauce<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:26.000> just

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
delve into those by the sauce so just

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.400 
delve into those by the sauce so just
get<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.910> here<00:04:29.910> we<00:04:30.030> go<00:04:30.150> with<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:31.280> whatever

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:46.210 

okay<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:37.470> beans<00:04:38.220> okay<00:04:40.190> basically<00:04:41.190> baked<00:04:41.610> beans

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.589 

okay<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:49.229> worst<00:04:50.150> definitely<00:04:51.150> okay

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
okay so the worst definitely okay

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.390 
okay so the worst definitely okay
they're<00:04:51.780> all<00:04:51.930> bad<00:04:52.169> but<00:04:52.440> like<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:53.009> worst<00:04:53.190> of<00:04:53.340> a

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
they're all bad but like the worst of a

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.779 
they're all bad but like the worst of a
bad<00:04:53.610> lunch<00:04:54.770> sausages<00:04:55.770> or<00:04:56.160> whatever<00:04:56.550> they<00:04:56.759> are

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
bad lunch sausages or whatever they are

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.010 
bad lunch sausages or whatever they are
terrible

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
terrible

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.420 
terrible
then<00:04:58.770> next<00:04:59.340> on<00:04:59.819> the<00:05:00.270> scale<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.599> these<00:05:00.720> things

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
then next on the scale of these things

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.430 
then next on the scale of these things
they're<00:05:02.430> not<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.729> about<00:05:03.000> expose<00:05:03.360> book<00:05:03.599> and<00:05:04.110> I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
