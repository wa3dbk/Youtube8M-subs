00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.740
 origami flowers paper hyacinth 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.740
 flower assembly 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello so flower module 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.169
 hyacinth have already done learned the most 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
 time to start assembling this flower 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.509
 to get a flower like 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.050
 on the picture 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.300
 you need to make about 25-30 petals from 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.460
 I went to this flower twenty six 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.869
 points 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.869
 each time the amount may vary 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.020
 first we make the stem for our flower 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 for this, I take a strip of paper width 7 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.650
 28 centimeters long and I will be his 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.030
 twist into a tube by means of ordinary 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.620
 skewers for kebabs 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 neatly wrap a piece of paper around 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.329
 tubules around a skewer 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.590
 from above you can put a drop of glue to 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 she did not spin 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 and neat and screwed in obliquely 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 the end of the tail I dig a bit too 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.049
 glue as a result is such 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.399
 tube about 6 millimeters thick 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.100
 if desired, it can be inserted 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.750
 wire for a year more reliably I 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.460
 constantly forgetting to do it and in 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.110
 principle without a tubule stalk too 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.290
 performs its functions well on 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.680
 petal 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.320
 Apply pva glue so plentifully enough 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.909
 and leave it to the top of our steppe 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.600
 before wing the next petals i 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.670
 a little bit 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.490
 I bend the upper part of the module 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.460
 I got 5 in the first round 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.149
 petals 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.340
 which stuck around the tube 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.770
 next row I stick four 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 petals in staggered order 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.680
 relation to the first row with the first two 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 rows simpler and the following petals are already 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.550
 I do n't stick to anyone 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 circles and so where is the place much more convenient 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.010
 paste where beautiful here already look 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.459
 to your eye and therefore the amount 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.300
 petals in each flower can be 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.300
 different 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.650
 so petals are gradually added 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.690
 our flower grows so to speak 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.700
 increases and the result is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 here's a flower bud 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.610
 hyacinth him you can do by 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 its discretion is shorter luxuriant 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.030
 and so on, that is, to whom which option 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.180
 closer to which option like this 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.180
 the way the flower bud we made 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.700
 proceed to the next stage do 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.599
 leaves for our flower they are enough 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 simple and make them very fast 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.680
 For this we take a square of paper you can 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.430
 do one on whom size you can do 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.100
 different sizes may be 15-20 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.560
 centimeters at your discretion so take 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.390
 squared paper we fold it by 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.370
 I rotate the diagonal 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.260
 to this diagonal we fold the downsides 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.370
 top corner for one and a half 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.780
 centimeter bend down and in the top 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.440
 the sides are also folded diagonally 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.160
 such a billet should turn out 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.569
 after that the downs again 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:46.739
 we fold to the diagonal 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:50.880
 we got a little twist it 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.920
 top and glue to the stalk 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.750
 two or four can be made 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.930
 leaves as you like this flower 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.100
 you can either put a vase or save 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.690
 for him some kind of box in this 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.490
 If I want to show you how to do it 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.410
 simple 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.260
 a stand for our hyacinth have 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.440
 will keep pretty good for 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.970
 this will need to be done somewhat 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.140
 tubules which we kids make for 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.290
 stalk stuff five six 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.800
 these tubes are flattened and twisted 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.010
 around the pencil the result is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.490
 Here is such a circle as 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.520
 twist and coat the glue tubes in 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.680
 the middle of this circle I insert our 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.550
 stalk and bottom it well 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.550
 glue 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.570
 for durability everything is still on top 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.949
 grease with glue and this is how our 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.949
 a flower in such a coaster 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.810
 and I for my hyacinth this time 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.870
 I wanted to make fetters instead of leaves 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.150
 corrugated vase and by the way I will be glad 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.580

 or corrugation vases for today all
