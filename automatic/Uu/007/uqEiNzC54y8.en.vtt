 cornstarch and the juice of the pineapple and by the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.550

 pepper egg and salt 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.750
 The first thing we have done has been to wash 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.910
 all the opening that we are going to cut to 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.120
 then as I said we cut 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.800
 the vegetables just cut the zucchini to 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 long to extract then a game 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.910
 ready 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.910
 as well totally 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.700
 Y 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.250
 we are getting some small plates 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.380
 of zucchini we will do exactly the same 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.370
 this carrot vegetable pepper and the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.590
 onion 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.810
 As you can see, we have already cut all our 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.950
 vegetable with the desired size 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.470
 approximately a rectangle of about 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 two centimeters by one centimeter 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.060
 we have also run the pineapple well and the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.530
 mushrooms we cut it into slices 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.970
 remember that the pineapple should be its juice and 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.980
 the new syrup once we have 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.070
 all this cut we remove it from a 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.830
 line 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 then let's take the piece of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.000
 Tenderloin and we're going to cut it into cubes 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 approximately we will ask for new 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 two by two centimeters a steak that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.450
 be a knife that is quite 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.969
 sharp 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.590
 and we started making the dice with the 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.719
 fruit of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.969
 it can also be another type of meat 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.720
 secret or any meat is limp 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.700
 of pork 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.560
 As you can see, we have finished cutting 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 our our piece of loin ribbon 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.130
 in more or less equal squares 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.770
 now let's proceed to make the sauce 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.180
 then we have not dropped a case and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.050
 we are going to be there the ingredients for 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.050
 the hikes of brushes the juice of the pineapple 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.409
 soy sauce 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.200
 Honey 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.470
 and take off 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.640
 to the trickle of ketchup 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.190
 simply using always the same 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.190
 measure 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.989
 and a little 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.049
 of vinegar 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.129
 and we will put the fire up 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.129
 about 34 minutes 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.530
 scenes 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.230
 in water 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.230
 we take a little bit and we move all 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.569
 until it is dissolved 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.190
 what's left that the bittersweet sauce arrived 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.370
 a little and then we throw the water 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:51.549
 with cornstarch that we mixed before 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.549
 as we see and we leave the 234 minutes 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.310
 will have to rectify that voice to everything 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.390
 been with sugar depends on the taste that 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.390
 have bittersweet 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.010
 while you are going to finish doing the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.630
 sauce we have caught an egg we have 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.130
 put two or three drops of oil 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.010
 olive we will proceed to sautÃ© the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.500
 vegetables the first thing we're going to do 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.720
 They are the carrot I guess that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.049
 how much longer will it take to do so 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.599
 we throw the carrot 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.940
 we hit him with oil and a blow of 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.949
 heat and then we will throw the next 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.569
 lost 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.490
 once we have given some ribbon 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:30.580
 the carrot we have thrown the rest of 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.349
 vegetables but this opinion is the pineapple the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.700
 we will use at the end so that he does not want 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.440
 delay a nap too much 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.990
 while they are opening 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.840
 we have fed the little pieces of man 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.290
 then we have taken another container with 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.170
 flour and another with the beaten egg and 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.870
 let's proceed to pass the spine through the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.690
 flour and then with the egg and egg 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.830
 It will be left on a plate to rest 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.050
 we could also do a kind of 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.090
 tempura with beer or water hanging 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.170
 because in this case we have done so 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.170
 egg and flour 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.030
 flavor 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.880
 once all the vegetables with the pineapple 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.490
 it has been done we proceed to the sauce 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.919
 bittersweet 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.919
 reading everything hot is worth 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.760
 look let the body flavored 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.560
 all the vegetables 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.090
 once we have all the pieces 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.570
 of what we have gone through the egg and flour 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.190
 will fry it in abundant oil a 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.020
 fried cow is going to put the paper 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.320
 drying so that all the oil happens 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.240
 surplus 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.290
 once the eye has been fried 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.290
 chamos networks 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.480
 everyone 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.610
 we let it rest for 34 minutes 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.840
 once we mix the chicken with the 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.420
 vegetables we have proceeded to the 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.940
 presentation of the plate and with this we have 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.150
 had in our sweet and sour pork I hope 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.150
