00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a little bit out of their spawn and you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.930 
a little bit out of their spawn and you
go<00:00:49.680> bobbing<00:00:50.070> them<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.579> look<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.789> the

strip club or the club to my left
through<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> building<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
through that building you have be on the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.850 
through that building you have be on the
left<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> mattress<00:01:13.320> which<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
left side of the mattress which is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
left side of the mattress which is
hanging<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> edge<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.540> there's<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
hanging out on the edge so there's a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.999 
hanging out on the edge so there's a
good<00:01:15.930> chance<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> probably<00:01:16.470> fall<00:01:16.619> off<00:01:16.650> unless

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
good chance to probably fall off unless

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
good chance to probably fall off unless
you<00:01:17.130> master<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.900> they'll<00:01:19.259> just

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you master it and then they'll just

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
you master it and then they'll just
spawn<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> strip<00:01:19.920> club<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.790> just

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
spawn in the strip club and you can just

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.399 
spawn in the strip club and you can just
walk<00:01:21.030> them<00:01:21.210> through<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> edge<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.259> can

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
walk them through the edge and you can

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
walk them through the edge and you can
keep<00:01:22.560> doing<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> same<00:01:23.220> thing<00:01:23.369> over<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> over

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
keep doing the same thing over and over

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
keep doing the same thing over and over
so<00:01:24.150> let's<00:01:24.330> pretend<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:25.290> kill<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so let's pretend you kill it at the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.260 
so let's pretend you kill it at the
jelly<00:01:26.189> shop<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.030> spawn

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
jelly shop and then you make them spawn

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
jelly shop and then you make them spawn
right<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> truck<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
right there at the truck as you see and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.109 
right there at the truck as you see and
you<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> make<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> again<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you want to make them do it again you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
you want to make them do it again you
just<00:01:30.270> kill<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.570> again<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> jelly<00:01:31.590> shop

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
just kill them again at the jelly shop

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
just kill them again at the jelly shop
and<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.729> wait<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.329> again<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and then you just wait here again and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.300 
and then you just wait here again and
you'll<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.049> them<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> truck<00:01:34.710> spawn<00:01:35.159> there

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you'll see them at the truck spawn there

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
you'll see them at the truck spawn there
again<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.329> happen<00:01:36.450> over<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> over

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
again and that will happen over and over

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
again and that will happen over and over
you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.220> sides<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you can do that for both sides so you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
you can do that for both sides so you
can<00:01:39.119> keep<00:01:39.299> doing<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> bunch<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
can keep doing this to get a bunch of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.280 
can keep doing this to get a bunch of
two<00:01:40.950> pieces<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.780> after<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> kill<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
two pieces or after you kill them at the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
two pieces or after you kill them at the
jelly<00:01:43.470> shop<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> go<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.790> the
