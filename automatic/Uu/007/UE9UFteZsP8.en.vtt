micro more by pressing two and then

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
micro more by pressing two and then
three<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> gateway<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:41.159> three<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.700> z<00:01:41.909> are

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
three is gateway because three and z are

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.090 
three is gateway because three and z are
very<00:01:42.299> closely<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.990> close<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> each<00:01:43.619> other<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
very closely it close to each other and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
very closely it close to each other and
so<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.229> early<00:01:46.500> game

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so by the way this is all for early game

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
so by the way this is all for early game
3<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.670> z<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.850> close<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> each<00:01:48.270> others<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.810> go

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
3 and z are close to each others like go

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 
3 and z are close to each others like go
3z<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.890> three<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> d<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.210> also<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.720> eat

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
3z and then three and d are also go eat

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
3z and then three and d are also go eat
each<00:01:51.930> other<00:01:52.079> d<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.880> actually<00:01:53.880> wait

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
each other d is for actually wait

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660 
each other d is for actually wait

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
3z and 3d and then for z &amp; D which is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.220 
3z and 3d and then for z &amp; D which is
for<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.130> also<00:02:31.370> gateway<00:02:31.700> 5<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:32.780> probe<00:02:33.020> that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
for is also gateway 5 is my probe that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.980 
for is also gateway 5 is my probe that
makes<00:02:33.500> my<00:02:33.680> expansion<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.730> can<00:02:35.270> go<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.840> my

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
makes my expansion so I can go make my

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.380 
makes my expansion so I can go make my
five<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.010> then<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.460> it's<00:02:37.910> usually<00:02:38.090> it's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
five and then I can it's usually it's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.640 
five and then I can it's usually it's
not<00:02:38.540> big<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.990> sometimes<00:02:39.380> they<00:02:39.470> don't<00:02:39.530> even

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
not big like sometimes they don't even

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.340 
not big like sometimes they don't even
do<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.010> five<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.210> an<00:02:41.780> extra<00:02:42.140> probe

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
do it five is just an extra probe

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.200 
do it five is just an extra probe
basically<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.280> make<00:02:43.490> whatever<00:02:43.730> units

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
basically just to make whatever units

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.630 
basically just to make whatever units
certain<00:02:44.480> structures<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.140> then<00:02:45.740> that's

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
certain structures and then that's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400 
certain structures and then that's
pretty<00:02:46.850> much<00:02:46.970> my<00:02:47.330> hockey's<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.990> game<00:02:48.140> mid

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
pretty much my hockey's for the game mid

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.770 
pretty much my hockey's for the game mid
game<00:02:48.650> for<00:02:49.310> protoss<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.910> hockey<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.660> for

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
game for protoss I hockey this is for

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
game for protoss I hockey this is for
all<00:02:50.810> matters<00:02:51.260> pretty<00:02:51.470> much<00:02:51.650> for<00:02:52.340> mid<00:02:52.490> game<00:02:52.670> I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
all matters pretty much for mid game I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.330 
all matters pretty much for mid game I
hockey<00:02:53.360> when<00:02:53.600> i<00:02:53.630> get<00:02:53.840> my<00:02:53.870> expansion<00:02:54.340> they're

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
hockey when i get my expansion they're

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.380 
hockey when i get my expansion they're
obviously<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.700> little<00:02:55.760> different<00:02:56.210> for<00:02:56.300> each

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
obviously a little different for each

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.170 
obviously a little different for each
matchup<00:02:56.660> but<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:58.130> general<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.850> where<00:02:59.060> it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
matchup but in general this is where it

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.440 
matchup but in general this is where it
is<00:02:59.500> for<00:03:00.500> protoss<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.190> mid<00:03:01.340> game<00:03:01.550> i<00:03:01.820> basically

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
is for protoss and mid game i basically

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.020 
is for protoss and mid game i basically
a<00:03:02.720> hockey<00:03:02.990> my<00:03:03.290> nexus<00:03:03.740> is<00:03:03.890> at<00:03:04.070> zero<00:03:04.400> nine<00:03:04.520> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
a hockey my nexus is at zero nine and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.760 
a hockey my nexus is at zero nine and
eight<00:03:05.150> depending<00:03:05.720> on<00:03:05.990> how<00:03:06.080> many<00:03:06.140> expansions<00:03:06.470> i

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
eight depending on how many expansions i

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.820 
eight depending on how many expansions i
have<00:03:06.950> again<00:03:07.730> 0<00:03:08.210> p<00:03:08.510> 9<00:03:08.780> p-8<00:03:09.200> p<00:03:09.410> very<00:03:09.620> close

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
have again 0 p 9 p-8 p very close

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.620 
have again 0 p 9 p-8 p very close
together<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:10.970> what<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.210> can<00:03:11.330> hockey

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
together so that's what you can hockey

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.070 
together so that's what you can hockey
your<00:03:11.780> necklaces<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.010> then<00:03:13.250> my<00:03:13.540> units<00:03:14.540> my<00:03:14.780> like

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
your necklaces and then my units my like

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.830 
your necklaces and then my units my like
armies<00:03:15.950> or<00:03:16.130> hockey<00:03:16.430> does<00:03:16.580> 12<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.390> then<00:03:17.600> maybe

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
armies or hockey does 12 and then maybe

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.770 
armies or hockey does 12 and then maybe
three<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.320> four<00:03:18.560> depending<00:03:18.950> on<00:03:19.100> how<00:03:19.220> many<00:03:19.780> how

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
three and four depending on how many how

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.830 
three and four depending on how many how
early<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:21.680> my<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:22.910> they<00:03:23.630> came

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
early it is and then my and they came

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.090 
early it is and then my and they came
amid<00:03:24.200> game<00:03:24.380> hockey's<00:03:24.710> are<00:03:24.830> pretty<00:03:24.980> much<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
amid game hockey's are pretty much the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.730 
amid game hockey's are pretty much the
same<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.550> then<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:26.240> hockey<00:03:26.900> my<00:03:27.140> gateways<00:03:27.500> as

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
same and then I hockey my gateways as

hockey is go to four I can still click
on<00:03:34.610> my<00:03:34.730> gateways<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.240> double<00:03:35.510> clicking<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:35.840> five

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
on my gateways I double clicking on five

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.199 
on my gateways I double clicking on five
and<00:03:36.380> then<00:03:37.040> I'm<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.370> call<00:03:37.550> i<00:03:37.580> give<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:37.940> right<00:03:38.090> next

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.390 
and then my medics is a separate group
tanks<00:06:30.990> is<00:06:31.140> a<00:06:31.169> separate<00:06:31.530> group<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:31.919> vessels<00:06:32.250> as

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
tanks is a separate group and vessels as

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.130 
tanks is a separate group and vessels as
a<00:06:32.430> separate<00:06:32.760> group<00:06:32.820> this<00:06:33.240> is<00:06:33.390> for<00:06:33.539> Andrew<00:06:33.930> Zerg

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
a separate group this is for Andrew Zerg

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.740 
a separate group this is for Andrew Zerg
only<00:06:34.410> the<00:06:34.890> reason<00:06:35.130> for<00:06:35.250> that<00:06:35.280> is<00:06:35.400> because<00:06:35.599> if

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
only the reason for that is because if

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.180 
only the reason for that is because if
Marines<00:06:37.020> are<00:06:37.200> hot<00:06:37.350> peas<00:06:37.530> with<00:06:37.710> medics<00:06:38.010> they

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
Marines are hot peas with medics they

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.950 
Marines are hot peas with medics they
cannot<00:06:38.430> stem<00:06:38.820> and<00:06:39.060> if<00:06:39.240> they<00:06:39.390> are<00:06:39.540> hockey<00:06:39.840> with

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
cannot stem and if they are hockey with

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.220 
cannot stem and if they are hockey with
medics<00:06:40.260> then<00:06:40.440> they<00:06:40.530> can<00:06:40.710> stem<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:41.220> so

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
medics then they can stem and so

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.070 
medics then they can stem and so
basically<00:06:44.180> you<00:06:45.180> want<00:06:45.300> the<00:06:45.480> ball<00:06:45.600> to<00:06:45.660> steam<00:06:45.960> at

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
basically you want the ball to steam at

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.130 
basically you want the ball to steam at
once<00:06:46.260> so<00:06:46.500> I<00:06:46.680> hockey<00:06:47.010> all<00:06:47.130> my<00:06:47.250> Marines<00:06:47.600> up<00:06:48.600> with

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
once so I hockey all my Marines up with

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.230 
once so I hockey all my Marines up with
one<00:06:49.410> more<00:06:49.620> reason<00:06:49.950> for<00:06:50.190> best<00:06:50.430> when<00:06:50.580> medics<00:06:51.030> can

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
one more reason for best when medics can

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.390 
one more reason for best when medics can
they<00:06:51.450> can<00:06:51.600> also<00:06:51.720> attack<00:06:52.230> and<00:06:52.440> then<00:06:52.560> tanks<00:06:53.310> they

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
they can also attack and then tanks they

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.710 
they can also attack and then tanks they
can<00:06:53.520> all<00:06:53.640> see<00:06:53.820> if<00:06:54.060> their<00:06:54.180> hockey<00:06:54.420> with<00:06:54.600> each

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
can all see if their hockey with each

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.970 
can all see if their hockey with each
other<00:06:54.900> if<00:06:55.170> they<00:06:55.290> hockey<00:06:55.470> with<00:06:55.650> something<00:06:55.890> else

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
other if they hockey with something else

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.940 
other if they hockey with something else
they<00:06:56.130> can<00:06:56.250> see<00:06:56.460> and<00:06:56.700> vessels<00:06:57.500> well<00:06:58.500> vessels

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
they can see and vessels well vessels

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.990 
they can see and vessels well vessels
are<00:06:59.040> just<00:06:59.190> there<00:06:59.340> you<00:06:59.460> can't<00:06:59.610> hockey<00:06:59.880> with

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
are just there you can't hockey with

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.820 
are just there you can't hockey with
them<00:07:00.150> with<00:07:00.300> anything<00:07:00.600> else<00:07:00.780> because<00:07:00.930> I<00:07:01.290> guess

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
them with anything else because I guess

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.520 
them with anything else because I guess
you<00:07:01.920> can<00:07:02.040> hockey<00:07:02.250> that<00:07:02.400> with<00:07:02.490> medics<00:07:02.820> except

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
you can hockey that with medics except

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.930 
you can hockey that with medics except
