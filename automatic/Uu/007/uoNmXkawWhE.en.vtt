now<00:00:02.760> that<00:00:03.030> we've<00:00:03.179> gone<00:00:03.389> through<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.959> startup

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
now that we've gone through the startup

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.730 
now that we've gone through the startup
and<00:00:04.730> functionality<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.089> standard<00:00:06.779> GNC

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740

piston<00:00:08.189> pump<00:00:08.429> system<00:00:08.880> what<00:00:09.540> I'd<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> do

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
piston pump system what I'd like to do

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
piston pump system what I'd like to do
is<00:00:10.469> go<00:00:10.710> through<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.099> differences<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
is go through the differences of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.180 
is go through the differences of
starting<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.019> with<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> diaphragm<00:00:13.559> pump<00:00:14.009> on

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
starting up one with a diaphragm pump on

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.430 
starting up one with a diaphragm pump on
there's<00:00:14.820> not<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> difference<00:00:16.049> but

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
there's not a lot of difference but

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 
there's not a lot of difference but
there<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.619> some<00:00:17.070> differences<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.910> need

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
there are some differences and you need

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
there are some differences and you need
to<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.300> aware<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.800> don't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
to be aware of this so that you don't

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.679 
to be aware of this so that you don't
try<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.460> exactly<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.090> same<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.570> with

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
try to do exactly the same thing with

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.150 
try to do exactly the same thing with
both<00:00:21.810> ways<00:00:22.250> first<00:00:23.250> off<00:00:23.630> with<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> engine<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
both ways first off with the engine the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.960 
both ways first off with the engine the
startup<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> same<00:00:27.119> gas<00:00:27.840> valve<00:00:28.320> choke<00:00:29.039> on

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
startup is the same gas valve choke on

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.519 
startup is the same gas valve choke on
an<00:00:30.300> off<00:00:30.420> button<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.080> forth

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
an off button and so forth

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.260 
an off button and so forth
but<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> regulator

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
but when you get to the regulator

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.880 
but when you get to the regulator
they're<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> little<00:00:34.079> bit<00:00:34.320> different<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.829> do

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
they're a little bit different they do

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.709 
they're a little bit different they do
the<00:00:35.219> same<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.180> look<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.690> little

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the same thing they just look a little

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.310 
the same thing they just look a little
different<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:38.129> regulator<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
different on a regulator like this on a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.490 
different on a regulator like this on a
boudoir<00:00:41.190> pump<00:00:41.719> any<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> other<00:00:43.079> diaphragm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it's a pressure release lever you pull

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
it's a pressure release lever you pull
it<00:00:48.780> over<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.160> forces<00:00:50.670> the
