 depth 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.800
 also a 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.260
 Halo has a new video from our 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 Christmas party in front of Christ 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.830
 and who do you know that? 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.180
 at it the videos of the others are 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.070
 of course as always earned in the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 infobox and today we set you 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.480
 back to yourself before and indeed there 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 it's biscuits from me today that's after 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.080
 my on that day special biscuit and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.790
 Although they are our final sugar and 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.250
 without white as I already have 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.230
 more than with spelled flour and refined sugar 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.790
 sugar through agents force you have to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 Of course, do not make it there are many 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.090
 say on data looks on is totally 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.370
 bad and totally unhealthy whom 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.739
 simple final sugar I know 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.610
 not exactly that you have to do it yourself 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.130
 Try and who does not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.690
 spelled flour market or simply not 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.010
 has at home and make the cookies play 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.510
 Of course, he also wants to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 wheat lives for me after my diet 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.810
 for if the course is not as healthy 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.780
 but I know that there are many of you 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 not worthy place so much and so then 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.870
 Of course you can also do it completely normal 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.870
 take ingredients is quite normal but 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.580
 keeps the conventional ingredients for biscuits 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.229
 I 've just tried her like that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.450
 to tune it a bit, but it does 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.190
 are nuts on it and it's also 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.780
 be or have a bit of cocoa butter 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.549
 she holds a little more taste than 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.320
 the conventional left thing I really did 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.820
 very strong lama now no longer 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.840
 missing but we are looking for yes says 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.180
 astrid faucet of ingredients we need 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.039
 first 250 kva margarine 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.009
 There it is relatively no matter which you 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.210
 next we need 500 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.299
 spelled flour but you can 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.130
 Of course, wheat flour as a small 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.770
 encore we need in cocoa or 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.820
 it's also important to bacau not one of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.280
 ascot for example 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.659
 besides, we need an egg and we 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.100
 need vanilla you can 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.520
 fresh were taking end or 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.080
 just vanilla aroma as 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.860
 We need sweeteners last 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.860
 agave thick juice 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.810
 the first step is that we have the flour 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.250
 with the egg and with the brand in look 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.250
 to give a big bowl 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.270
 we stir with a spoon, the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.520
 but could also be very good with the hands 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.520
 just try as a small preliminary work 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.650
 Now come about six tablespoons of agave 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.110
 Dicksaft in the dough depending on how cute 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.430
 you may want to do more 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.799
 there are still chopped cashew kernels coming 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.470
 in the dough now the vanilla and as 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:03:01.349
 last only the bacau of it like that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:02.940
 one to two tablespoons now everything becomes 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.739
 mixed together you can with 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.239
 I would do it with a stop 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.530
 the hands recommend since the on 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.530
 fastest is the easiest 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.849
 Now some flour comes over yours 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.040
 work surface and then will then 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.040
 the dough distributed on the mail 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.980
 Now it's fun to do that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.350
 are the biscuits gouged now 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.970
 I have there and sternschnuppen form 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.410
 and he can be really nice 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.410
 Christmas cookies out 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.849
 needed to bake the entire day 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.879
 In any case, I need three full areas 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.799
 the biscuits on circulating air at about 180 degrees 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.230
 Ten to 15 minutes in the oven 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.950
 depending on how brownies always wants 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.950
 to look something up 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.150
 so see your beautifully finished now 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
 Biscuits I really think they are 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.629
 also look very appetizing and 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 They also taste good and my cat has 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.790
 she also tries herself 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.950
 Do you know that a bit of a day for you 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.600
 but as a note 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.600
 so well 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.070
 that 's it with the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.340
 concept the result as well as beautiful 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.620
 video are now these two 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.930
 resing of cannabis is likely 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.790
 too much for most and you should 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.680
 you also eat relatively fresh because you 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.240
 help taste the best then take it 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.430
 then you just half the portion that 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.190
 is it in part for example 500 Traumeel 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.600
 just in 250 grams of flour and then you have 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.400
 you actually a good amount that is 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.840
 then just a part from that's enough 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.700
 actually for such a good evening with the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.680
 family away from the tv says so 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.180
 actually good, too, I have now 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.770
 only done so much because I have the crisis 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.990
 still monday with take to school 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.040
 and the biscuits are really tasty 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.380
 Well, we can do that now 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.120
 We'll share it here 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.590
 I get the stars like that 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.830
 at last you do not want to give it a whiff 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.050
 just before the war of tailors too much 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.060
 Sleep the crayfish itself 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.010
 well my last video that was a food 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.390

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.580
 infobox
