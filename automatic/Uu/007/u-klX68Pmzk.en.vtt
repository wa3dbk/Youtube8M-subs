00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.410
 and hello dear swami friends 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.750
 limestone well today i would like to ask 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.510
 you have a very interesting question how are you 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.759
 think what it is of course many 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 already guessed it is good old and 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.140
 unremarkable command block 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.539
 however, today I want to prove to you that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.579
 it is he who is this particular command unit 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.189
 even more interesting is not capable 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.230
 make your world of minecraft well just 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.290
 chic yes let's throw it out to us 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 no longer needed more precisely we need but not 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.680
 here we need water and four 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.970
 bad teams that will do here 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 so yes we just take a bow take an arrow 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.290
 and doing like this we just take and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.470
 blow everything up 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 we explode a place here we explode that place 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.640
 we blow up the animals need to find 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 animals I can not say about such 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.860
 the subject we just all explode with 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 bows and arrows without any mods without everything 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.309
 anything whatever we need here 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 this scheme 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 and the last snapshot ie this scheme 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.659
 will act on all versions 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 minecraft above 1 and 8 to the floor 18 here and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 in general yes let's get down to the review 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.830
 What kind of scheme is this? 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.990
 works and what to start with 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 and so here we have a redstone block that he 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.620
 does he go through the comparator 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.120
 the comparator must be special 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.370
 position that is if we put here 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.320
 in such a way that it will not be a fig 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.190
 it is necessary to work so that he was exactly in 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.140
 such provisions 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210
 further what we have here further we 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.970
 there are command blocks comparator 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.409
 repeater and more command blocks and so 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.210
 how do we get the command block 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.580
 the command block is obtained like this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 team you can carefully her 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.430
 consider that is, we have gif further 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.659
 spelled 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.429
 either the player's name or as I wrote 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.649
 variable denoting the nearest 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.840
 the player and then the teams block that is 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.649
 this block or its name which we 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 want to get 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.049
 yes thatâ€™s how we throw out the command again 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.769
 block and see what is itself 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.470
 the essence of the teams and so here in our team 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.980
 blocks written test for further curves 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.590
 coordinates or rather variable type r 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.599
 what does this block do it test is there 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.260
 the world here is this arrow that is released 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.049
 from our bow further this one 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.160
 the block here is spelled out the command which 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.430
 spawn tente 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.760
 on variable coordinates above us then 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.579
 we have here y that is 80 blocks above 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.500
 we have an interest, that is, if we fly up 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.980
 these are the same blocks of days that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.130
 constantly spawn they are in 80 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.440
 block top here 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 our most command chain ie here from 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.630
 of this block and then fyuz views that is 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.820
 how would ignition i mean how many seconds 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 left tintin blast that is if on 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.370
 first suit they have air arrow songs 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.620
 age to her teleports almost 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.690
 blown up throw 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.270
 which will blow up somewhere in eight 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.000
 I do not know one hundredths of ten 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.860
 that is, the unit of a second or 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.420
 time in general, then you can of course 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.820
 put less but i wouldn't you 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.370
 advised it is actually very dangerous 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.560
 that is, we only release the shooter she 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.360
 already became exploding i.e. not necessary 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.310
 set a very small size 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.930
 it is not necessary to become a very big well as the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.810
 the size that is in the ignition is not necessary 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.720
 put a little very big and by the way 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.590
 saying you very much i ask you very much not 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.540
 forget 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.060
 if you build this scheme with us 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.010
 can only be built on snapshot 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.580
 ah or on version 181 on and so on then 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.040
 There is a snapshot 148 and some new one there 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.670
 can fly on the screen and leave it 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.380
 image and higher to tus version 18 and 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.300
 when you build the circuit please do not 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.390
 forget to set the cutter here because 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.190
 I watched this diagram of different tutorial 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.890
 people as they did and tell you 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.990
 honestly in the comments just wild not 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.580
 I know srach because people just 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.440
 forget to put on this one 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.750
 a piece of the word well here and here 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.470
 circuits do not work at all so don't 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.570
 forget 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.549
 then what we do here this block 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.530
 then we have it written 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.530
 teleported almost exploded dandy 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.060
 the arrow is just enough to have an arrow 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.830
 There is kent who you there somewhere 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.430
 air flies and it teleports to 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.920
 stage 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.350
 yes I think there is enough clear this 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.020
 we have a very important kill command 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.310
 then the coordinate is very variable 5-ku 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.220
 you constantly this faith that is 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.620
 what does she do she removes our arrow 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.810
 so that later this team will earn you 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.460
 because if we remove this block from 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.710
 us a fig will not work works 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.510
 once and then this arrow will remain 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.280
 forever and we will have nothing else 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.380
 work like this 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.950
 you just if we run now 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.430
 can run many times 1 2 if we 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.710
 remove this block started once 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.530
 started the second time nothing works 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.370
 so this block is very important in which 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.130
 will get meadows 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.780
 to sad sad but oh well in general 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.270
 this is the essence of this 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.070
 drop dead circuit i'll try in 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.690
 next time find something else 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.270
 interesting things you might like 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.980
 will interest you and you are not interesting too 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.350
 Minecraft Facts or Teams 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.000
 Well, in general, thank you all for watching 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.140
 put likes call friends leave 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.760
 comments and also don't forget 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.450
 subscribe to the channel with you was 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.100
