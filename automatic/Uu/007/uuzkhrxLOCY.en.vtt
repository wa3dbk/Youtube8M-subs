of<00:02:37.190> small<00:02:37.489> Anton<00:02:37.940> Bowen<00:02:38.269> warp<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.810> he<00:02:38.900> went<00:02:39.049> to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
of small Anton Bowen warp so he went to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.509 
of small Anton Bowen warp so he went to
the<00:02:39.290> offender<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:39.799> they<00:02:39.950> designed<00:02:40.220> an<00:02:40.340> 80

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
the offender and they designed an 80

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.080 
the offender and they designed an 80
watt<00:02:41.560> output<00:02:42.560> transformer<00:02:43.340> peaking<00:02:43.640> at<00:02:43.730> 100

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
watt output transformer peaking at 100

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.090 
watt output transformer peaking at 100
watts<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.600> wasn't<00:02:45.080> quite<00:02:45.170> loud<00:02:45.440> enough<00:02:45.470> so

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
watts that wasn't quite loud enough so

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.120 
watts that wasn't quite loud enough so
we<00:02:46.220> got<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:48.110> only<00:02:48.200> friend<00:02:48.470> had<00:02:48.560> developed<00:02:48.980> a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
we got the only friend had developed a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.130 
we got the only friend had developed a
hundred<00:02:49.730> watt<00:02:49.940> power<00:02:50.330> transformer<00:02:51.110> that

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
hundred watt power transformer that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.560 
hundred watt power transformer that
Peter<00:02:51.530> 120<00:02:52.459> watts<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.440> hence<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.100> showman

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
Peter 120 watts and hence the showman

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.449 
Peter 120 watts and hence the showman
after<00:02:56.570> Dick<00:02:56.720> Dale<00:02:56.930> he's<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> showman<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.980> an

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
after Dick Dale he's a showman and an

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.009 
after Dick Dale he's a showman and an
amazing<00:02:59.000> Sherman

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
amazing Sherman

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.810 
amazing Sherman
it<00:03:00.350> doesn't<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:00.709> reverb<00:03:01.070> I'm<00:03:01.220> using<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.549> pedal

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
it doesn't have reverb I'm using a pedal

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.460 
it doesn't have reverb I'm using a pedal
for<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:02.959> what<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.170> sounds<00:03:03.440> like

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
for that this is what it sounds like

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.229 
for that this is what it sounds like
without<00:03:03.799> reverb

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239
