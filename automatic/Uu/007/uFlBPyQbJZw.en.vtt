00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
asus has included their cpu installation

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.570 
asus has included their cpu installation
tool<00:00:02.970> with<00:00:03.270> their<00:00:03.689> new<00:00:04.069> z170<00:00:05.069> motherboards

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
tool with their new z170 motherboards

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.089 
tool with their new z170 motherboards
one<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.509> biggest<00:00:06.810> problems<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.410> our<00:00:07.680> mas

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
one of the biggest problems with our mas

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.520 
one of the biggest problems with our mas
are<00:00:08.340> one<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> biggest<00:00:08.730> causes<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.510> our<00:00:10.200> mas

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
are one of the biggest causes of our mas

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.499 
are one of the biggest causes of our mas
with<00:00:10.950> motherboards<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> past<00:00:11.940> has<00:00:12.240> been

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
with motherboards in the past has been

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.539 
with motherboards in the past has been
bent<00:00:12.870> CPU<00:00:13.349> pins<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.219> pretty<00:00:14.370> much

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
bent CPU pins so this pretty much

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:24.590 
bent CPU pins so this pretty much
guarantees<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.660> won't<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
guarantees that you won't do that so to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.599 
guarantees that you won't do that so to
get<00:00:24.779> started<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.470> our<00:00:26.070> skylake

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
get started we have our skylake

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.570 
get started we have our skylake
processor<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.980> CPU

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
processor right here and we have the CPU

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
processor right here and we have the CPU
installation<00:00:30.420> tool<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.990> want<00:00:31.140> to

find is the little triangle that's on
the<00:00:34.410> corner<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.890> CPU<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.239> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the corner of your CPU that is going to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
the corner of your CPU that is going to
line<00:00:36.480> up<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.530> triangle<00:00:38.010> right

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
line up with the little triangle right

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000 
line up with the little triangle right
here<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.180> CPU<00:00:39.690> installation<00:00:40.320> tool<00:00:40.530> so

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here on the CPU installation tool so

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
here on the CPU installation tool so
what<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.219> want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.149> want<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> flip

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
what you want to do is you want to flip

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020 
what you want to do is you want to flip
the<00:00:42.809> CPU<00:00:43.200> installation<00:00:43.980> tool<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.340> anyway

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the CPU installation tool over anyway

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.850 
the CPU installation tool over anyway
you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.270> still<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.350> triangle

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you can still see the little triangle

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.220 
you can still see the little triangle
right<00:00:47.039> there<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
right there so what we want to do is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.880 
right there so what we want to do is
we're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> flip<00:00:49.739> our<00:00:50.039> CPU<00:00:50.460> over<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
we're going to flip our CPU over and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
we're going to flip our CPU over and
we're<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> go<00:00:53.250> ahead<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> put

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
we're going to go ahead and kind of put

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.740 
we're going to go ahead and kind of put
this<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.300> click

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
this in there and it will kind of click

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.709 
this in there and it will kind of click
and<00:00:58.020> lock<00:00:58.530> into<00:00:59.039> place<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.539> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and lock into place and you can see that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
and lock into place and you can see that
it's<00:01:00.840> locked<00:01:01.050> into<00:01:01.260> place<00:01:01.350> which<00:01:02.280> means<00:01:02.520> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's locked into place which means that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's locked into place which means that
it's<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> fall<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.500> ahead

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it's not going to fall when we go ahead

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.539 
it's not going to fall when we go ahead
and<00:01:04.830> put<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.850> our<00:01:06.680> motherboard<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and put it on our motherboard now that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.570 
and put it on our motherboard now that
we<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.820> our<00:01:09.030> CPU<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.380> CPU<00:01:10.830> installation

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
we have our CPU in the CPU installation

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.880 
we have our CPU in the CPU installation
tool<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.110> line<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
tool all we have to do is line up the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
tool all we have to do is line up the
arrow<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> arrow<00:01:15.119> or<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
arrow so you can see the arrow or the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.740 
arrow so you can see the arrow or the
triangle<00:01:16.500> rather<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.490> actual<00:01:18.210> CPU<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
triangle rather on the actual CPU and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
triangle rather on the actual CPU and
you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.930> actually<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.130> CPU

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you can actually see it on the CPU

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
you can actually see it on the CPU
installation<00:01:21.090> tool<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.360> well<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.049> right

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
installation tool as well it's right

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.749 
installation tool as well it's right
here<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> corner<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.340> line<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> up

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
here in the corner so we line that up

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.600 
here in the corner so we line that up
and<00:01:24.350> Asus<00:01:25.350> has<00:01:25.470> done<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> great<00:01:25.799> job<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.310> here

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and Asus has done a great job right here

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
and Asus has done a great job right here
having<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> triangle<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.710> well

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
having the triangle right there as well

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
having the triangle right there as well
so<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> line<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.450> those

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
so all you have to do is line up those

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.859 
so all you have to do is line up those
triangles<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.829> more<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.250> less<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.869> set

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
triangles and you more or less just set

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.679 
triangles and you more or less just set
it<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.000> there<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it right on there and there you go and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.289 
it right on there and there you go and
we<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.350> ahead<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.670> lock<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
we can go ahead and you know lock it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.190 
we can go ahead and you know lock it
down<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.869> everything<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
down and everything like that and of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
down and everything like that and of
course<00:01:43.229> we're<00:01:43.950> locked<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.820> ready<00:01:44.970> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
course we're locked and we're ready to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
course we're locked and we're ready to
go<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.899> much<00:01:46.020> guarantees<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
go it pretty much guarantees that you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
go it pretty much guarantees that you
won't<00:01:47.130> bend<00:01:47.399> any<00:01:47.579> pins<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> again<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.570> was

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
won't bend any pins and again that was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
won't bend any pins and again that was
the<00:01:48.720> big<00:01:49.320> problem<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.579> lot<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.119> first-time

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the big problem with a lot of first-time

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
pins this makes it so you pretty much

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.300 
pins this makes it so you pretty much
can<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.770> pretty<00:02:04.920> much<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
