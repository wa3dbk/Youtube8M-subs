00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.459
 the evolution of ancient Greek sculpture 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.639
 comprises three great periods archaic 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.490
 classical and Hellenistic at the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.560
 shapes are dirtier and unnatural 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.039
 evolving into a heroic type of 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.029
 representation of the ever beautiful young man 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.220
 and modeling 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.800
 in the end naturalism gives way to 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.050
 realism with the representation of several 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.470
 ages of man and less models 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.989
 regular and pathetic as drunks 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 dying painful figure at night etc. 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.879
 works of art to Greek architecture 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.969
 began in the archaic period that 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.309
 It occurred between 60 and 50 781 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.870
 Christ and throughout history has suffered 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.940
 transformations always aiming at 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.739
 perfection and its representations 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.920
 In this same period the Greeks 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.539
 contact with faroni art and that contact 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.609
 acquire knowledge about art 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.720
 Egyptian influence of the sculptures 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.460
 in the following periods 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.850
 the classic and old period occurred 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.280
 approximately between 480 and 450 before 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.049
 christ known as the golden age 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 was the pinnacle of art in Greece 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.340
 in this period art is so important 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.740
 what about science what reality shows 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.659
 nationalist representation of ghettos in 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.600
 of the human figure was concerned with 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.790
 the details and movement of the body 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.799
 one of the most present characteristics 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.380
 in the works of the period only rupture 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.640
 straightforwardness anatomy more natural support 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.130
 in one with high page again 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.409
 supported and the expression representation 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.479
 dry face 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.490
 Another aspect was widely used 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.290
 golden ratio that equals 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.479
 about 1.6 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.610
 the Greeks applied this concept 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.130
 cultures of the human body discovering 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.829
 various measurement relationships the example of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.409
 using Carver EO ratio is cleto 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.030
 which in the 20th century before Christ affirmed 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.210
 that the body is seven times the size of 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.210
 head 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 periods and old the only lonely period 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.010
 has strictness and sobriety of treatment 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.810
 of bodies and faces freezing an action 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 the period reveals abandonment of rigidity and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.849
 tactical attitudes of the body in a study 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.280
 more detailed in autonomy the details 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.599
 Decorative are reduced to a minimum 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.880
 shots and old brought a series of 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.739
 major formal and technical innovations 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.360
 ideologies for sculpture from 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.860
 338 before Christ already in the period 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.530
 Hellenistic when Greece was 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.959
 incorporated into Rome there is sophistication 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.519
 despite the power of civilization to have 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.519
 fallen due to internal wars 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.180
 In this period, too, there was the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.280
 to present the human mind will try 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.760
 but still based on the neighborhood concept 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.590
 ideal 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.959
 the difference that there was a more inspection 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.670
 complex theatrical with more feeling 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.620
 characteristics that manifested themselves in the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.450
 baroque movement later 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.700
 there was also a better trim of the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.739
 tissue on the body which made the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.750
 come from the most perfect we can 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.280
 relate the beautiful concept of the Greeks 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.680
 that one of the Platonic philosophers and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.079
 Aristotle and Plato said that art 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.450
 should follow the house looking for these two 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.670
 ideal types pouring out traces 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.100
 individuals also states that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.910
 that the beautiful is proportionally harmonious and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.100
 absolute florestÃ³polis introduced in the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.109
 salon to the sensitive world its 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.090
 concept of beautiful related 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.489
 coordination and harmony of the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.980
 perceptible in the works that used the 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.109
 golden ratio said not imitation 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.829
 that produces pleasure but perfect 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.090
 execution 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.430
 the idea is that they fit perfectly 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.940
 in the aspects adopted in the sculptures 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.940
 greek 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.049
 both philosophers consider a beautiful 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.389
 ideal as something universal necessary 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.389
 absolute infinitely superior to the race 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.920
 in general the innovations observed in the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.350
 sculptures of Greece between periods 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.389
 The Hellenistic scenario was 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.970
 naturalism of forms but with 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.200
 general indemnity of the human figure 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.880
 rules of body representation 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.500
 breach of the law of frontality and 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.500
 appearance of the smile and the knot
