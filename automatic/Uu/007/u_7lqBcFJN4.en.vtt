Jaggi<00:03:41.580> appearance<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.570> going<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.810> give<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
Jaggi appearance it's going to give the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.130 
Jaggi appearance it's going to give the
interpretation<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.340> fur<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.390> where<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.959> want

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
interpretation of fur so where you want

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.080 
interpretation of fur so where you want
to<00:03:46.200> put<00:03:46.320> these<00:03:46.410> jagged<00:03:46.770> lines<00:03:47.160> anywhere<00:03:47.790> that

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
to put these jagged lines anywhere that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.630 
to put these jagged lines anywhere that
the<00:03:48.239> fur<00:03:48.570> line<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:49.080> be<00:03:49.200> bending<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.459> go

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
the fur line will be bending so as I go

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.550 
the fur line will be bending so as I go
along<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:51.209> back<00:03:51.510> here<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.200> going<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.470> be

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
along this back here it's going to be

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.040 
along this back here it's going to be
smooth<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.520> as<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.730> curves<00:03:54.030> down<00:03:54.270> around<00:03:54.780> his

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
smooth but as it curves down around his

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.990 
smooth but as it curves down around his
rump<00:03:55.320> it's<00:03:55.560> going<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.520> going<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.760> disrupt

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
rump it's going to it's going to disrupt

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.970 
rump it's going to it's going to disrupt
the<00:03:57.239> flow<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.900> some<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> four<00:03:58.650> would<00:03:58.800> kind

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
the flow so some of the four would kind

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.670 
the flow so some of the four would kind
of<00:03:59.070> stick<00:03:59.250> out<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.430> little<00:03:59.550> bit<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.470> his<00:04:01.470> tail

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
of stick out a little bit on his tail

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.710 
of stick out a little bit on his tail
it'll<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> smooth<00:04:02.400> line<00:04:02.610> going<00:04:02.970> up<00:04:03.150> then<00:04:03.630> on

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
it'll be a smooth line going up then on

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.810 
it'll be a smooth line going up then on
the<00:04:03.840> backside<00:04:04.110> I'm<00:04:04.800> gonna<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> little<00:04:05.580> bit

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
the backside I'm gonna have a little bit

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.630 
the backside I'm gonna have a little bit
more<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.170> rough<00:04:10.130> smoother<00:04:11.130> along<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
more of of a rough smoother along the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.280 
more of of a rough smoother along the
side<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.030> his<00:04:12.150> leg<00:04:12.180> till<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.840> comes<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.170> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
side of his leg till it comes to the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.660 
side of his leg till it comes to the
knee<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.709> then<00:04:13.920> kind<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.430> rough

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
knee and then kind of a little rough

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.320 
knee and then kind of a little rough
around<00:04:14.850> there<00:04:16.489> just<00:04:17.489> like<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.120> kind

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
around there just like so and then kind

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:26.140 
around there just like so and then kind
of<00:04:18.419> Jaggi<00:04:19.229> underneath<00:04:19.650> for<00:04:19.830> his<00:04:19.919> belly

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.180 

maybe<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.750> little<00:04:26.990> jagged<00:04:27.230> inside<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.800> his<00:04:27.920> here

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
maybe a little jagged inside of his here

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.520 
maybe a little jagged inside of his here
for<00:04:28.460> some<00:04:28.610> extra<00:04:28.970> further<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:30.230> then<00:04:30.320> some

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
for some extra further and then some

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.560 
for some extra further and then some
jagged<00:04:30.890> lines<00:04:31.100> around<00:04:31.670> for<00:04:31.910> his<00:04:32.000> head<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.390> kind

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
jagged lines around for his head to kind

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.780 
jagged lines around for his head to kind
of<00:04:32.660> distinguish<00:04:33.080> his<00:04:33.260> head<00:04:33.500> skull<00:04:34.190> area<00:04:34.580> from

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
of distinguish his head skull area from

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.010 
of distinguish his head skull area from
the<00:04:34.910> rest<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:35.210> his<00:04:35.300> neck<00:04:37.330> okay<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.600> find<00:04:38.930> him

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
the rest of his neck okay so I find him

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.540 
the rest of his neck okay so I find him
pretty<00:04:39.200> well<00:04:39.320> outline<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.040> way<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.190> want<00:04:40.460> to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
pretty well outline the way I want to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.190 
pretty well outline the way I want to
but<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.090> want<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.360> put<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.540> little<00:04:41.750> extra<00:04:41.990> detail

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
but I want to put a little extra detail

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.340 
but I want to put a little extra detail
with<00:04:42.530> his<00:04:42.650> mouth<00:04:42.890> I<00:04:43.360> got<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:44.510> idea<00:04:44.720> when<00:04:45.050> I

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
with his mouth I got this idea when I

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.500 
with his mouth I got this idea when I
was<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.740> when<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.220> was<00:04:46.370> drawing<00:04:46.910> these<00:04:47.060> lines<00:04:47.150> in

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
was in when I was drawing these lines in

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.000 
was in when I was drawing these lines in
there<00:04:47.660> someone<00:04:47.930> have<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.080> race<00:04:48.410> kind<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.740> hard

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
there someone have to race kind of hard

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.640 
there someone have to race kind of hard
to<00:04:49.700> get<00:04:49.850> some<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.120> those<00:04:50.240> lines<00:04:50.510> out<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:51.230> you

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
to get some of those lines out and you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.410 
to get some of those lines out and you
can<00:04:51.770> see<00:04:51.920> because<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:52.280> pushed<00:04:52.580> so<00:04:52.820> hard<00:04:52.850> here

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
can see because I pushed so hard here

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.870 
can see because I pushed so hard here
these<00:04:54.170> lines<00:04:54.380> are<00:04:54.590> pretty<00:04:55.100> stuck<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.700> here

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
these lines are pretty stuck in here

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.540 
these lines are pretty stuck in here
I've<00:04:55.970> kind<00:04:56.210> of<00:04:56.240> ground<00:04:56.600> those<00:04:56.900> in<00:04:57.140> but<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.340> can

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
I've kind of ground those in but you can

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.790 
I've kind of ground those in but you can
race<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.090> get<00:04:59.180> most<00:04:59.419> of<00:04:59.570> them<00:04:59.720> out<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.440> open

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
race and get most of them out and open

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.310 
race and get most of them out and open
his<00:05:00.919> mouth<00:05:01.220> up<00:05:01.580> just<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.330> little<00:05:02.360> bit<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:06.230> I'm

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
his mouth up just a little bit and I'm

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.530 
his mouth up just a little bit and I'm
going<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.500> put<00:05:06.710> in<00:05:06.830> just<00:05:07.040> a<00:05:07.370> little<00:05:07.550> baby<00:05:08.210> tooth

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
going to put in just a little baby tooth

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.290 
going to put in just a little baby tooth
right<00:05:08.870> there<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:13.400> I'm<00:05:13.520> going<00:05:13.669> to<00:05:13.730> shadow<00:05:14.090> this

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
right there and I'm going to shadow this

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.960 
right there and I'm going to shadow this
in<00:05:14.510> around<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.980> tooth<00:05:16.160> seek<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.700> see<00:05:16.850> it<00:05:16.940> a

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
in around the tooth seek and see it a

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.960 
in around the tooth seek and see it a
little<00:05:17.060> bit<00:05:17.240> better<00:05:17.419> I<00:05:18.700> just<00:05:19.700> think<00:05:19.880> that

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
little bit better I just think that

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.670 
little bit better I just think that
would<00:05:20.120> be<00:05:20.150> cute<00:05:20.450> had<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.750> little<00:05:21.080> little<00:05:21.620> tiny

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
would be cute had a little little tiny

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.920 
would be cute had a little little tiny
baby<00:05:22.250> Wolf's<00:05:22.640> tooth<00:05:24.100> here<00:05:25.100> it<00:05:25.220> goes<00:05:25.780> so<00:05:26.780> there

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
baby Wolf's tooth here it goes so there

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.240 
baby Wolf's tooth here it goes so there
we<00:05:27.020> have<00:05:27.140> our<00:05:27.320> completed<00:05:27.710> wolf<00:05:28.010> I'm<00:05:28.100> just

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
we have our completed wolf I'm just

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.100 
we have our completed wolf I'm just
going<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.400> take<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.610> side<00:05:28.820> of<00:05:28.850> my<00:05:29.060> pencil<00:05:29.480> just

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
going to take the side of my pencil just

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.570 
going to take the side of my pencil just
kind<00:05:30.320> of<00:05:30.410> run<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.680> little<00:05:30.890> shadowing

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
kind of run a little shadowing

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.280 
kind of run a little shadowing
underneath<00:05:32.150> him<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:32.750> doesn't<00:05:33.020> look<00:05:33.110> like

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
underneath him so it doesn't look like
