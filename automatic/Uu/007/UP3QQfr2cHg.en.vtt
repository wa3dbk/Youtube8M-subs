threat<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:28.750> show<00:00:29.169> you<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.410> at<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.310> other<00:00:30.460> side

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.740 

this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> list

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 

it<00:00:40.140> fits

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it fits

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.490 
it fits
it<00:00:42.330> connects

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.320 

everywhere

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.950 

and<00:00:54.450> all<00:00:54.990> the<00:00:55.140> bolts

are<00:01:00.500> in<00:01:00.710> its<00:01:00.860> place

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.380 

so<00:01:04.850> how<00:01:05.239> square<00:01:06.010> is<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.250> gun<00:01:07.430> free<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:08.300> the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
so how square is the gun free to the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.670 
so how square is the gun free to the
supports<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:10.220> zoom<00:01:10.400> in

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.599 

in<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.190> part

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:21.170 

we<00:01:16.609> can<00:01:16.820> see

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.929 

because<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.490> fits

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.959 

quite<00:01:26.509> good<00:01:27.020> there's<00:01:27.200> no<00:01:28.479> almost<00:01:29.479> no<00:01:30.729> space<00:01:31.729> in

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
quite good there's no almost no space in

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.700 
quite good there's no almost no space in
it<00:01:32.530> further

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
it further

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.840 
it further
vertically<00:01:34.579> it<00:01:34.819> is<00:01:34.969> different

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.390 

smoke<00:01:40.119> squirtle<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:41.110> maybe<00:01:41.350> that's<00:01:41.530> not<00:01:41.770> a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
smoke squirtle it maybe that's not a

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.120 
smoke squirtle it maybe that's not a
problem

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
problem

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.429 
problem
but<00:01:45.549> this<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.000> touching<00:01:46.360> here<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:47.259> one

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
but this one is touching here this one

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.630 
but this one is touching here this one
is<00:01:47.469> touching<00:01:47.950> here<00:01:48.189> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.050 

in<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:51.300> this<00:01:51.660> piece<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:52.050> wood<00:01:53.060> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
in there this piece of wood is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.540 
in there this piece of wood is
absolutely<00:01:54.690> flat<00:01:56.390> now<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.960> make<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:59.160> same<00:01:59.370> one

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
absolutely flat now I make the same one

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.480 
absolutely flat now I make the same one
on<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.090> left<00:02:00.270> side<00:02:00.510> now<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.950> same<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.400> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
on the left side now the same at the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.150 
on the left side now the same at the
left<00:02:02.670> side<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:03.350> can<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.870> beam

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.300 

is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.880 
is
look

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
look

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.880 
look
Square

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
Square

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.059 
Square
to<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.780> support

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.640 

if<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.640> line<00:02:21.879> if<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.510> line<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.219> here

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.429 

I<00:02:26.709> aligned<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.489> one<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:29.700> there's<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.849> hole

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
I aligned this one here there's a hole

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.680 
I aligned this one here there's a hole
this<00:02:32.439> size<00:02:34.290> yeah

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.460 

and<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.500> only<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.100> distance<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.790> maybe

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and that is only on a distance of maybe

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.740 
and that is only on a distance of maybe
10<00:02:41.470> centimeters

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
10 centimeters

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:52.720 
10 centimeters
so<00:02:44.350> we<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.460> hole<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.000> here

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.430 

this<00:02:53.730> size<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.680> not<00:02:55.860> good<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.310> all
