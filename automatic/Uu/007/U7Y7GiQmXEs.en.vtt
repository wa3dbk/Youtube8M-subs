00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119

actually<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:27.110> pretty<00:00:27.890> interesting<00:00:27.980> show

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
actually a pretty interesting show

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.179 
actually a pretty interesting show
because<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.050> just<00:00:30.200> basically<00:00:30.560> about<00:00:31.160> a

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
because it's just basically about a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.150 
because it's just basically about a
family<00:00:33.610> that<00:00:34.610> just<00:00:34.640> fight<00:00:35.390> people<00:00:36.160> and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
family that just fight people and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.740 
family that just fight people and
interrupt<00:00:37.790> their<00:00:37.910> blinds<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.239> save<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.570> world

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
interrupt their blinds to save the world

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.550 
interrupt their blinds to save the world
but<00:00:39.670> apparently<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:41.360> like<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.870> it's<00:00:42.410> also

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
but apparently it's like the it's also

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.910 
but apparently it's like the it's also
tied<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.280> with<00:00:43.840> being<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.079> shortest<00:00:45.260> series

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
tied in with being the shortest series

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.910 
tied in with being the shortest series
along<00:00:46.399> with<00:00:46.430> cat<00:00:47.059> scratch<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.930> el<00:00:48.380> tigre<00:00:48.740> the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
along with cat scratch and el tigre the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.250

adventures<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.370> mini<00:00:49.640> riviera<00:00:50.560> now<00:00:53.260> the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
adventures of mini riviera now the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.560 
adventures of mini riviera now the
reason<00:00:54.590> why<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.770> show<00:00:55.130> got<00:00:55.400> cancelled<00:00:56.560> is<00:00:58.570> it

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
reason why the show got cancelled is it

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.499 
reason why the show got cancelled is it
was<00:00:59.720> never<00:01:00.460> made<00:01:01.460> publicly<00:01:02.350> so<00:01:03.350> basically<00:01:04.509> it

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
was never made publicly so basically it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.300 
was never made publicly so basically it
was<00:01:05.600> only<00:01:05.960> on<00:01:06.140> for<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.500> year<00:01:06.829> now<00:01:07.009> only<00:01:07.159> got

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
was only on for a year now only got

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.620 
was only on for a year now only got
twenty<00:01:07.640> episodes<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:09.490> I'm<00:01:10.490> all<00:01:11.030> I'm<00:01:11.210> gonna<00:01:11.329> say

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
twenty episodes so I'm all I'm gonna say

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.380 
twenty episodes so I'm all I'm gonna say
is<00:01:11.659> either<00:01:12.140> Nickelodeon<00:01:13.150> cancelled<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.210> for

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
is either Nickelodeon cancelled it for

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.649 
is either Nickelodeon cancelled it for
low<00:01:14.840> ratings<00:01:15.560> some<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.610> producers<00:01:16.909> quit

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
low ratings some of the producers quit

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.809 
low ratings some of the producers quit
maybe<00:01:18.079> the<00:01:18.409> show<00:01:18.619> didn't<00:01:19.070> make<00:01:19.159> enough<00:01:19.280> money

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
maybe the show didn't make enough money

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.139 
maybe the show didn't make enough money
I<00:01:20.210> don't<00:01:21.109> know<00:01:23.319> so<00:01:24.319> I<00:01:24.770> really<00:01:25.549> wouldn't<00:01:26.060> know

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
I don't know so I really wouldn't know

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.169 
I don't know so I really wouldn't know
but<00:01:29.499> the<00:01:30.499> exes<00:01:31.009> was<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> short<00:01:31.639> live<00:01:31.789> show<00:01:31.969> which

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
but the exes was a short live show which

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.830 
but the exes was a short live show which
I<00:01:32.389> think<00:01:32.659> could<00:01:32.899> probably<00:01:33.319> come<00:01:34.009> back<00:01:34.039> now

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
I think could probably come back now

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.690 
I think could probably come back now
some<00:01:35.840> explanation<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.740> how<00:01:37.189> this<00:01:37.340> could<00:01:37.520> come

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
some explanation to how this could come

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.080 
some explanation to how this could come
back<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.090> were<00:01:38.509> some<00:01:38.719> possibilities<00:01:39.549> well<00:01:43.090> so

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
back and were some possibilities well so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.309 
back and were some possibilities well so
far<00:01:44.329> for<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.939> exes<00:01:47.270> basically<00:01:47.840> they've<00:01:48.079> got

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
far for the exes basically they've got

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.459 
far for the exes basically they've got

recurring recurring villains of course

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.279 
recurring recurring villains of course
and<00:01:55.100> maybe<00:01:55.520> they<00:01:55.789> could<00:01:55.850> change<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:57.079> their

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.569 
and maybe they could change up their
comedy<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:58.039> little<00:01:58.279> bit<00:01:58.459> make<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.789> funny<00:02:00.579> maybe
