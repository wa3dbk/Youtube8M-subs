with<00:07:04.699> dad<00:07:04.939> I<00:07:04.969> hope<00:07:05.240> he<00:07:05.360> gets<00:07:05.509> that<00:07:05.719> worked<00:07:05.990> out

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
with dad I hope he gets that worked out

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.200 
with dad I hope he gets that worked out
I<00:07:06.560> mean<00:07:07.009> it's<00:07:07.129> kind<00:07:07.310> of<00:07:07.370> unfortunate<00:07:07.490> but<00:07:08.120> I

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
I mean it's kind of unfortunate but I

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.779 
I mean it's kind of unfortunate but I
think<00:07:08.419> his<00:07:08.539> dad<00:07:08.780> needs<00:07:09.710> to<00:07:10.039> learn<00:07:10.400> he's<00:07:10.580> not<00:07:10.759> a

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
think his dad needs to learn he's not a

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.730 
think his dad needs to learn he's not a
little<00:07:10.940> kid<00:07:11.030> anymore<00:07:11.210> and<00:07:11.900> treat<00:07:12.440> him<00:07:12.530> like<00:07:12.620> a

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
little kid anymore and treat him like a

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.200 
little kid anymore and treat him like a
man<00:07:13.009> and<00:07:13.069> hopefully<00:07:13.520> they'll<00:07:13.699> get<00:07:13.849> that<00:07:14.030> thing

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
man and hopefully they'll get that thing

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.119 
man and hopefully they'll get that thing

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:16.129 
resolved but great performance last

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:19.959

night by nonito Donaire and hey I'm

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.540 
night by nonito Donaire and hey I'm
looking<00:07:20.419> forward<00:07:20.690> to<00:07:20.810> I<00:07:21.280> can't<00:07:22.280> say<00:07:22.460> I'm

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
looking forward to I can't say I'm

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.369 
looking forward to I can't say I'm
looking<00:07:22.819> forward<00:07:23.060> to<00:07:23.180> pack<00:07:23.449> y'all<00:07:23.719> mostly<00:07:24.199> but

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:24.379 
looking forward to pack y'all mostly but

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:25.659 
looking forward to pack y'all mostly but
that's<00:07:24.770> probably<00:07:25.009> the<00:07:25.159> next<00:07:25.280> time<00:07:25.520> I'm<00:07:25.639> going

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669 
that's probably the next time I'm going

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.700 
that's probably the next time I'm going
to<00:07:25.789> talk<00:07:25.940> about<00:07:26.120> but<00:07:26.900> I<00:07:27.139> think<00:07:27.440> it's<00:07:27.560> going<00:07:27.620> to

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
to talk about but I think it's going to

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.930 
to talk about but I think it's going to
be<00:07:27.800> a<00:07:27.830> good<00:07:27.979> fight<00:07:28.219> for<00:07:28.460> at<00:07:28.550> least<00:07:28.639> a<00:07:28.789> few

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940 
be a good fight for at least a few

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.110 
be a good fight for at least a few
rounds<00:07:29.180> so<00:07:29.840> we'll<00:07:30.139> see<00:07:30.319> how<00:07:30.349> that<00:07:30.500> goes<00:07:31.120> until

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 
rounds so we'll see how that goes until

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.440 
rounds so we'll see how that goes until
then<00:07:32.300> this<00:07:32.870> is<00:07:32.930> renegade
