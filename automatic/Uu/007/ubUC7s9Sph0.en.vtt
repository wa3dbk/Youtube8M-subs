00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.500
 do not presume that 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 and I am also too much 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.280
 frankly, never in that I see myself

 let's forget it, I would have often 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.289
 Again and again such a request if I 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.869
 want to do so but had so far 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.940
 I honestly do not 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.119
 disgusting the terrain on crutches not 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.009
 see the ambition to do so 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 no idea I have no cash 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.940
 From tend I'm doing what every 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.500

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.569
 and for me, I've had it easy so far 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.849
 do not waste time and just concentrate 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.130
 what I can but who knows if this 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.970
