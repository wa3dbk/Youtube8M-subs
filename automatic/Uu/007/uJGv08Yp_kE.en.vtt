00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
to me in structuring a story and what a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.870 
to me in structuring a story and what a
reader<00:03:55.900> will<00:03:56.109> do<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.410> put<00:03:56.590> together<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
reader will do to put together the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.810 
reader will do to put together the
important<00:03:58.269> parts<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:59.200> story<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.769> grew<00:04:00.549> up<00:04:00.730> in

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
important parts of a story I grew up in

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.180 
important parts of a story I grew up in
a<00:04:00.880> family<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.269> musicians<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.859> didn't<00:04:03.100> get

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
a family of musicians and I didn't get

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.620 
a family of musicians and I didn't get
any<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.519> talent<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:03.970> didn't<00:04:04.180> get<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.450> ear

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
any of the talent I didn't get the ear

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.460 
any of the talent I didn't get the ear
but<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.049> got<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:06.060> thing<00:04:07.060> where<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:08.350> know<00:04:08.440> a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
but I got that thing where you know a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.259 
but I got that thing where you know a
few<00:04:08.890> notes<00:04:09.100> strung<00:04:09.430> together<00:04:09.609> can<00:04:09.970> make<00:04:10.120> me

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
few notes strung together can make me

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.360 
few notes strung together can make me
weep<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:11.440> also<00:04:11.620> had<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:11.950> translated

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
weep and I also had it translated

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.099 
weep and I also had it translated
forwards<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.269> there<00:04:13.390> were<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.600> few<00:04:13.840> words

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
forwards and there were a few words

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.289 
forwards and there were a few words
strung<00:04:14.410> together<00:04:14.560> can<00:04:14.980> make<00:04:15.010> me<00:04:15.250> weep<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:16.180> I

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
strung together can make me weep and I

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.960 
strung together can make me weep and I
hope<00:04:16.600> that<00:04:17.229> I<00:04:17.289> can<00:04:17.560> do<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.829> for<00:04:18.100> readers<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
hope that I can do that for readers the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.000 
hope that I can do that for readers the
way<00:04:19.060> music<00:04:19.239> has<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.660> was<00:04:19.780> done<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:19.989> me<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.650> the
