00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
what to say about that performance again

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.419 
what to say about that performance again
it's<00:00:06.720> like<00:00:06.870> every<00:00:07.350> time<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.620> play<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.950> home<00:00:08.160> I

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
it's like every time we play at home I

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.330 
it's like every time we play at home I
see<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.059> same<00:00:09.420> same<00:00:09.870> performance<00:00:10.320> over<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
see the same same performance over and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.070 
see the same same performance over and
over<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.820> over<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.330> over<00:00:12.480> again<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:15.080> think

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
over and over and over again and I think

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.370 
over and over and over again and I think
right<00:00:16.260> now<00:00:16.730> our<00:00:17.730> worry<00:00:18.180> isn't<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.230> going

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
right now our worry isn't if we're going

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.710 
right now our worry isn't if we're going
to<00:00:19.439> sign<00:00:19.710> coke<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.910> transfer<00:00:21.539> window

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
to sign coke in the transfer window

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.670 
to sign coke in the transfer window
we're<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> sign<00:00:22.609> control<00:00:24.019> any<00:00:25.019> player<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we're going to sign control any player I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.080 
we're going to sign control any player I
think<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:27.420> issue<00:00:27.630> now<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.099> if<00:00:29.099> whether<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:29.970> not

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
think the issue now is if whether or not

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.240 
think the issue now is if whether or not
David<00:00:30.359> Moyes<00:00:30.750> will<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.260> sacked<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.890> who<00:00:32.070> will

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and one of the problems is that David

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
and one of the problems is that David
Moyes<00:00:40.739> does<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> winning<00:00:41.879> mentality

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
winning mentality and that is the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790 
winning mentality and that is the
problem<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> problem<00:00:49.110> David<00:00:49.590> Moyes
