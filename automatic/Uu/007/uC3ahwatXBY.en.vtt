to<00:00:04.290> guide<00:00:04.500> we're<00:00:04.890> doing<00:00:05.190> chapter<00:00:05.670> 6<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.150> fall

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
to guide we're doing chapter 6 the fall

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.140 
to guide we're doing chapter 6 the fall
part<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.220> one<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.429> big<00:00:08.700> enough<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.940> we

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
part one this one is big enough that we

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.180 
part one this one is big enough that we
had<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.450> break<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:09.900> into<00:00:10.170> two<00:00:10.650> parts

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
had to break it up into two parts

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.799 
had to break it up into two parts
because<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.519> definitely<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> pretty<00:00:12.540> large

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
because it's definitely a pretty large

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.079 
because it's definitely a pretty large
chapter<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.130> that's<00:00:14.670> why<00:00:14.790> we're<00:00:14.880> gonna<00:00:14.940> have

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
chapter so that's why we're gonna have

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.160 
chapter so that's why we're gonna have
to<00:00:15.150> break<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.389> up<00:00:15.450> into<00:00:15.540> multiple<00:00:15.660> parts<00:00:16.049> so

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to break it up into multiple parts so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.870 
to break it up into multiple parts so
first<00:00:16.410> off<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.830> start<00:00:17.190> falling<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
first off and we start falling all the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.840 
first off and we start falling all the
way<00:00:18.060> down<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.510> giant<00:00:18.840> hole<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.470> I'll

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
way down this giant hole that I'll

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this beginning parts there's gonna be a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.279 
this beginning parts there's gonna be a
lot<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.090> walking<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> fast

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
lot of walking so I'm going to fast

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.990 
lot of walking so I'm going to fast
forward<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.099> don't<00:00:29.220> know<00:00:29.400> spend

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
forward it so that we don't know spend

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
forward it so that we don't know spend
too<00:00:30.210> much<00:00:30.359> time<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.439> fast-forwarding

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
too much time I'm just fast-forwarding

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.290 
too much time I'm just fast-forwarding
through<00:00:32.070> my<00:00:32.279> trying<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> find<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.120> where

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
through my trying to find out where

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
through my trying to find out where
where<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:35.160> follow<00:00:35.460> each

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
where to go here and just follow each

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
where to go here and just follow each
area<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.420> shoot<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> portals<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:38.190> as

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
area that I shoot the portals on well as

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
area that I shoot the portals on well as
you're<00:00:38.550> watching<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.420> didn't<00:00:39.660> put

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you're watching this one if I didn't put

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
you're watching this one if I didn't put
it<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.440> super<00:00:40.739> fast<00:00:40.950> mode<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.730> would<00:00:41.850> take

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it in super fast mode then it would take

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.690 
it in super fast mode then it would take
a<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:42.239> long<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.340> once<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> come<00:00:44.610> up

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
a long long time so once you come up

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.740 
a long long time so once you come up
here<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> might<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.450> stuck

here you might get a little stuck

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
here you might get a little stuck
because<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> wide-open<00:00:46.410> area<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.280> did<00:00:47.820> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
because it's a wide-open area I did for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
because it's a wide-open area I did for
a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.110> is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
going to fast-forward through this thing

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.150 
going to fast-forward through this thing
because<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.819> takes<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.060> little<00:02:36.150> while<00:02:37.160> open

through this door and then we're coming
out<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.280> we're<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.730> go<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
out here and we're going to go be in the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.500 
out here and we're going to go be in the
spot<00:02:42.750> where<00:02:43.190> there<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.400> an<00:02:44.550> open<00:02:45.000> door<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.420> a

spot where there is an open door in a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.120 
spot where there is an open door in a
second<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.140> want<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.830> walk

through the open door you can't walk
through<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.350> door<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.100> a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
through the door because it's just a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.640 
through the door because it's just a
crack<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.570> shoot<00:02:52.019> portal<00:02:52.560> right

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
there shoot a second portal right this

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.580 
there shoot a second portal right this
wall<00:02:55.170> here<00:02:55.500> walk<00:02:56.430> right<00:02:56.610> through<00:02:57.560> although<00:02:58.560> I

something that I was like hand over my

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.759 
something that I was like hand over my
Nova<00:03:03.450> Corps<00:03:03.630> later<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.050> then<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.739> here

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
Nova Corps later and then up here

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.100 
Nova Corps later and then up here
there's<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> lever<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.150> wall<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:06.930> some

there's a lever on the wall and for some

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.990 
there's a lever on the wall and for some
reason<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.500> took<00:03:07.650> me<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> very<00:03:07.890> long<00:03:08.280> time<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
reason it took me a very long time to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.970 
reason it took me a very long time to
find<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.360> lever<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.930> was<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.380> oh<00:03:10.470> poo<00:03:10.650> level

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
find this lever I was like oh poo level

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.190 
find this lever I was like oh poo level
lever<00:03:11.370> where's<00:03:11.910> where's<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.480> lever<00:03:12.720> where

where oh there it is and once you pull

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.590 
where oh there it is and once you pull
the<00:03:16.860> lever<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.250> door<00:03:17.430> opens<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.390> we're

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
the lever the door opens and then we're

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.479 
the lever the door opens and then we're
going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.870> start<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:19.320> all<00:03:19.769> pretty<00:03:20.430> much

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
actually do them and then as we walk

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.099 
actually do them and then as we walk
from<00:03:59.820> here<00:04:00.150> we<00:04:00.299> want<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.510> shoot<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.660> portal<00:04:00.959> up

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
from here we want to shoot a portal up

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.069 
from here we want to shoot a portal up
to<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.320> top<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:03.540> can't<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.840> down<00:04:03.989> this

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
to the top here you can't go down this

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.990 
to the top here you can't go down this
direction<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.739> then<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.400> want<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.670> shoot<00:04:05.850> a

direction and then we want to shoot a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.750 
direction and then we want to shoot a
portal<00:04:06.299> at<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.510> ground<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:08.340> another

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
portal at the ground and then another

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.789 
portal at the ground and then another
one<00:04:09.000> at<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.359> little<00:04:09.600> ramp<00:04:09.930> area<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.560> one

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
one at this little ramp area so one

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.949 
one at this little ramp area so one
right<00:04:11.100> below<00:04:11.250> us<00:04:11.400> at<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:12.239> ramp<00:04:12.540> thing<00:04:12.780> right

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
right below us at this ramp thing right

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.650 
right below us at this ramp thing right
here<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.410> another<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.459> easily<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.450> we<00:04:15.540> can

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
here and another one easily so we can

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.479 
here and another one easily so we can
jump<00:04:15.840> right<00:04:15.959> into<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.229> like<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.979> then

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
jump right into it like this and then

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.490 
jump right into it like this and then
just<00:04:17.729> drop<00:04:18.030> down<00:04:18.359> off<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.959> area<00:04:19.320> if

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
just drop down off of this area if

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.719 
just drop down off of this area if
you're<00:04:19.620> on<00:04:19.709> top<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.010> little<00:04:20.250> board<00:04:20.489> it'll

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
you're on top of that little board it'll

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.460 
you're on top of that little board it'll
be<00:04:20.850> easy<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.180> fly<00:04:21.870> yourself<00:04:22.049> all<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.409> way

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
be easy to fly yourself all the way

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.740 
be easy to fly yourself all the way
across<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:23.070> then<00:04:23.909> open<00:04:24.479> this<00:04:24.599> door

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
across and then open this door

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.390 
across and then open this door
and<00:04:25.870> then<00:04:26.440> there's<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.680> bunch<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:26.920> walking<00:04:27.280> and

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
and then there's a bunch of walking and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.980 
and then there's a bunch of walking and
I<00:04:27.460> kind<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.670> skipped<00:04:27.880> through<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.210> part<00:04:28.450> so

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
I kind of skipped through that part so

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.060 
I kind of skipped through that part so
then<00:04:29.110> here's<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.410> little<00:04:29.650> area<00:04:29.800> where<00:04:30.040> you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
then here's a little area where you

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.320 
then here's a little area where you
might<00:04:30.280> get<00:04:30.430> stuck<00:04:30.610> for<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.850> little<00:04:30.970> bit<00:04:31.120> too

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
might get stuck for a little bit too

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.620 
might get stuck for a little bit too
there<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.680> if<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.580> walk<00:04:33.790> down<00:04:33.820> these<00:04:34.270> steps

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
there is a if you walk down these steps

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.590 
there is a if you walk down these steps
there<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.770> a<00:04:35.800> giant<00:04:36.250> hole<00:04:36.640> where<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.390> can

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
there is a giant hole where you can

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.570 
there is a giant hole where you can
