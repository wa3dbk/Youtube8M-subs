this is the second part of the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.170 
this is the second part of the
assessment<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.430> this<00:00:08.580> time<00:00:08.790> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.120> to

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
assessment and this time we're going to

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.970 
assessment and this time we're going to
use<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.480> mat<00:00:09.630> again<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:10.500> going<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.740> be

abdomen<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.970> we've<00:00:15.120> already<00:00:15.300> done<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
abdomen so we've already done the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.529 
abdomen so we've already done the
preliminary<00:00:16.010> identifications<00:00:17.010> now<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.390> you

this pulled up do I actually get ready
to<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> pulse<00:00:34.079> checks<00:00:34.500> because<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.920> now

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
to do the pulse checks because right now

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.219 
to do the pulse checks because right now
I<00:00:35.550> would<00:00:35.940> explain<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.539> that<00:00:36.569> I<00:00:36.780> need<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
I would explain to them that I need to

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:38.770 
I would explain to them that I need to
listen<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> their<00:00:37.800> heart<00:00:37.979> and<00:00:38.100> their<00:00:38.249> lungs

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.119 
listen to their heart and their lungs
when<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.109> come<00:00:40.289> in<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.620> gonna<00:00:40.739> look<00:00:40.979> at

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
when I first come in I'm gonna look at

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
when I first come in I'm gonna look at
their<00:00:41.280> general<00:00:41.729> color<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.179> see<00:00:42.359> what<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> skin

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
their general color to see what the skin

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
their general color to see what the skin
color<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.739> cyanotic<00:00:44.159> blue<00:00:44.550> looking

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
color is are they cyanotic blue looking

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.770 
color is are they cyanotic blue looking
where<00:00:45.059> they're<00:00:45.179> not<00:00:45.329> getting<00:00:45.569> enough

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
where they're not getting enough

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
where they're not getting enough
perfusion<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:47.249> also<00:00:47.519> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
perfusion I'm also going to take and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.379 
perfusion I'm also going to take and
look<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.139> their<00:00:49.350> skin<00:00:49.769> on<00:00:50.100> their<00:00:50.370> hands<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.879> on

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389 
look at their skin on their hands and on

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.419 
look at their skin on their hands and on
their<00:00:51.629> feet<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.139> if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.859> have<00:00:53.039> trouble<00:00:53.399> with

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
their feet and if you have trouble with

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.189 
their feet and if you have trouble with
circulation<00:00:54.089> it<00:00:54.239> usually<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.690> start<00:00:54.929> first

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
circulation it usually will start first

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
circulation it usually will start first
in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> extremities<00:00:55.979> also<00:00:56.909> do<00:00:57.089> what<00:00:57.299> we<00:00:57.329> call

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
in the extremities also do what we call

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.329 
in the extremities also do what we call
a<00:00:57.600> capillary<00:00:57.989> refill<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.769> all<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.100> doing

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
a capillary refill and all you're doing

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.160 
a capillary refill and all you're doing
is<00:00:59.459> smashing<00:00:59.850> your<00:00:59.909> finger<00:01:00.299> and<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.780> should<00:01:00.989> go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is smashing your finger and it should go

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.199 
is smashing your finger and it should go
back<00:01:01.409> within<00:01:01.649> three<00:01:02.100> seconds<00:01:02.639> and<00:01:02.819> if<00:01:02.909> it<00:01:02.999> does

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209 
back within three seconds and if it does

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.060 
back within three seconds and if it does
that's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.809> sign<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.559> perfusion

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
that's a sign you have good perfusion

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
that's a sign you have good perfusion
good<00:01:05.190> circulation<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.940> on<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.810> longer

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
good circulation going on if it's longer

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.540 
good circulation going on if it's longer
than<00:01:07.229> three<00:01:07.530> seconds<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> sign<00:01:08.340> you've

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
than three seconds there's a sign you've

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.370 
than three seconds there's a sign you've
got<00:01:08.700> trouble<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.060> circulation<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.230> we've

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
got trouble with circulation so we've

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.500 
got trouble with circulation so we've
done<00:01:10.620> this<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.070> general<00:01:11.700> skin<00:01:11.970> color<00:01:12.210> check

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
done this this general skin color check

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
done this this general skin color check
we've<00:01:12.900> done<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> perfusion<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.460> hands

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we've done the perfusion is on the hands

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
we've done the perfusion is on the hands
and<00:01:15.120> on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.270> feet<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.260> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.830> ahead

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and on the feet we also want to go ahead

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
and on the feet we also want to go ahead
and<00:01:17.340> look<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.910> see<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.140> any

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and look and see if they have any

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
and look and see if they have any
swelling<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:19.980> edema<00:01:20.010> in<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.580> extremities

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
swelling or edema in the extremities

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780 
swelling or edema in the extremities
especially<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> while<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.010> go

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
especially and while you're down here go

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
especially and while you're down here go
ahead<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.360> pulse<00:01:24.600> checks<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.470> can

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
ahead and do your pulse checks you can

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.680 
ahead and do your pulse checks you can
take<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.280> pedal<00:01:26.580> pulse<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
take and do the pedal pulse which is

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.810 
take and do the pedal pulse which is
right<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.020> top<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.920> order<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> check<00:01:29.550> an

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
right on top and in order to check an

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
right on top and in order to check an
artery<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> bone<00:01:31.170> near<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
artery you have to have a bone near the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
artery you have to have a bone near the
artery<00:01:31.920> where<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.430> mash<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.880> artery

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
artery where you can mash that artery

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
artery where you can mash that artery
against<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.690> bone<00:01:33.870> so<00:01:34.410> I've<00:01:34.530> checked<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
against the bone so I've checked the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
against the bone so I've checked the
pulse<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.630> door<00:01:36.810> style<00:01:37.110> PETA's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
pulse and this is the door style PETA's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
pulse and this is the door style PETA's
or<00:01:37.740> sometimes<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> first<00:01:38.550> refer<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.120> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
or sometimes you first refer to as the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.930 
or sometimes you first refer to as the
pedal<00:01:39.510> pulse<00:01:39.980> you<00:01:40.980> want<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> posterior

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
pedal pulse you want to do the posterior

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.180 
pedal pulse you want to do the posterior
tibial<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.690> directly<00:01:43.230> behind<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.830> inside

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
tibial that's directly behind the inside

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of the ankle and you always check both

pulse zero through four and of course if
we<00:01:53.070> had<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> zero<00:01:53.580> we'd<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.090> big<00:01:54.270> trouble

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
we had a zero we'd be in big trouble

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.840 
we had a zero we'd be in big trouble
because<00:01:54.750> we'd<00:01:54.870> have<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.290> heartbeat<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
because we'd have no heartbeat one is

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.210 
because we'd have no heartbeat one is

very weak two is considered normal and

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.070 
very weak two is considered normal and
three<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.610> four<00:01:59.670> is<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.330> pounding<00:02:00.960> where

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
three and four is more pounding where

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.390 
three and four is more pounding where
you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.530> barely<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.070> your<00:02:02.190> hands

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
you can actually barely get your hands

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.370 
you can actually barely get your hands
on<00:02:02.580> it's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.090> good<00:02:03.240> beat<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.930> we've<00:02:04.110> done

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
on it's a really good beat so we've done

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
on it's a really good beat so we've done
the<00:02:04.770> pulse<00:02:05.010> checks<00:02:05.370> here<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:06.090> usually<00:02:06.450> don't

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the pulse checks here we usually don't

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.089 
the pulse checks here we usually don't
do<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> popliteal<00:02:07.470> it's<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.890> hardest

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
do the popliteal it's one of the hardest

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309 
do the popliteal it's one of the hardest
ones<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> find<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.060> routinely<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
ones to find and routinely we do the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.679 
ones to find and routinely we do the
posterior<00:02:10.830> tibia<00:02:11.579> and<00:02:11.790> site<00:02:11.969> the<00:02:12.090> ankle<00:02:12.389> the

posterior tibia and site the ankle the
dorsal<00:02:13.139> pedis<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.249> will<00:02:14.609> come<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:14.999> and<00:02:15.180> do

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.190 

the<00:02:19.709> femoral<00:02:20.099> pulse<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.120> find<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the femoral pulse which is find the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.470 
the femoral pulse which is find the
groin<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.709> Midway<00:02:23.099> there<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.910> by<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.300> way

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
groin it's Midway there and by the way

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.119 
groin it's Midway there and by the way
remember<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.930> don't<00:02:25.080> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.379> check<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.860> pulse

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
remember you don't want to check a pulse

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.410 
remember you don't want to check a pulse
with<00:02:26.340> your<00:02:26.489> thumb<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:26.819> you've<00:02:27.060> got<00:02:27.239> up

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
with your thumb because you've got up

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.729 
with your thumb because you've got up
pulse<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:28.080> thumb<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.379> want<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.620> check

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
pulse in your thumb you want to check

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.369 
pulse in your thumb you want to check
their<00:02:29.010> heart<00:02:29.250> rate<00:02:29.540> check<00:02:30.540> both<00:02:30.750> sides<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
their heart rate check both sides and

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.869 
their heart rate check both sides and
again<00:02:31.470> we're<00:02:31.830> doing<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.280> because<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:32.849> to

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
again we're doing it because we want to

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.030 
again we're doing it because we want to
make<00:02:33.030> sure<00:02:33.239> we've<00:02:33.540> got<00:02:33.569> equal<00:02:34.230> amount<00:02:34.799> of

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
make sure we've got equal amount of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.650 
make sure we've got equal amount of
amplitude<00:02:35.760> strength<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.629> both

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
amplitude strength going on on both

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.309 
amplitude strength going on on both
sides<00:02:37.849> now<00:02:38.849> when<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.299> back<00:02:39.480> up<00:02:39.660> here<00:02:39.690> we

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
sides now when we get back up here we

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.729 
sides now when we get back up here we
can<00:02:40.440> also<00:02:40.650> check<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.780> radio<00:02:43.140> pulse<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
can also check the radio pulse on the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.610 
can also check the radio pulse on the
thumb<00:02:43.980> side<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.640> again<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.260> put<00:02:46.470> their

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
thumb side and again they can put their

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.199 
thumb side and again they can put their
arm<00:02:46.799> up<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.190> hold<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.519> over<00:02:47.640> or<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> can

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
arm up and hold it over or you can

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.550 
arm up and hold it over or you can
circle<00:02:48.599> around<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.959> other<00:02:49.200> side<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
circle around to the other side of the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.380 
circle around to the other side of the
bit<00:02:49.709> whichever<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.250> want<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.000> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
bit whichever you want to do and you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.420 
bit whichever you want to do and you
want<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.660> check<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.049> radio<00:02:52.319> pulse<00:02:52.560> check<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
want to check the radio pulse check the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.520 
want to check the radio pulse check the
brachial<00:02:53.819> pulse<00:02:54.030> also<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.930> we're<00:02:55.380> not

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
brachial pulse also and we're not

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.199 
brachial pulse also and we're not
counting<00:02:55.890> we're<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.519> checking<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:56.940> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
counting we're just checking for the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.870 
counting we're just checking for the
strength<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.170> pulse<00:02:58.440> okay<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.700> we've<00:02:59.849> got

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
strength of the pulse okay so we've got

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.940 
strength of the pulse okay so we've got
the<00:03:00.180> brachial<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.290> also<00:03:01.440> check<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the brachial you can also check the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.660 
the brachial you can also check the
carotid

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
carotid

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.430 
carotid
but<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.360> check<00:03:03.629> them<00:03:03.780> at<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.959> same<00:03:04.170> time

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
but don't check them at the same time

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.720 
but don't check them at the same time
because<00:03:04.620> if<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.920> put<00:03:05.129> pressure<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.549> both

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
because if you put pressure on both

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.220 
because if you put pressure on both
sides<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.209> that's<00:03:06.329> enough<00:03:06.629> pressure<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.079> can

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
sides and that's enough pressure you can

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
sides and that's enough pressure you can
include<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.709> blood<00:03:07.890> goal<00:03:08.099> flow<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.879> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
include the blood goal flow going to the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.150 
include the blood goal flow going to the
brain<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.810> that's<00:03:09.959> your<00:03:10.260> pulse<00:03:10.470> checks<00:03:10.860> there

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
brain so that's your pulse checks there

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.789 
brain so that's your pulse checks there
so<00:03:11.730> now<00:03:11.910> what<00:03:12.599> I'd<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:13.110> go<00:03:13.260> into<00:03:13.440> right

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
so now what I'd like to go into right

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.190 
so now what I'd like to go into right
next<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.519> actually<00:03:14.879> just<00:03:15.390> watching<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.900> chest

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
next is actually just watching the chest

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.470 
next is actually just watching the chest
rise<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.530> fall<00:03:16.829> what<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.640> see<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.060> one<00:03:18.239> side<00:03:18.269> I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
rise and fall what I see on one side I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.030

should see on the other side and we call
that<00:03:20.160> symmetry<00:03:20.489> I'm<00:03:21.090> looking<00:03:21.600> the

that symmetry I'm looking the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.900 
that symmetry I'm looking the
respirations<00:03:22.410> look<00:03:22.590> nice<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.190> easy<00:03:23.459> it

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
respirations look nice and easy it

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.220 
respirations look nice and easy it
doesn't<00:03:24.239> look<00:03:24.329> like<00:03:24.389> they're<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.810> any<00:03:24.959> type<00:03:25.200> of

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
the intercostal retraction that you'd

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.930 
the intercostal retraction that you'd
see<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.709> child<00:03:37.739> or<00:03:38.220> someone<00:03:38.519> that's<00:03:38.730> very

see in a child or someone that's very

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.390 
see in a child or someone that's very
thin<00:03:39.209> okay<00:03:39.870> once<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:41.099> actually

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
thin okay once you have actually

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.330 
thin okay once you have actually
inspected<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.359> see<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:43.079> symmetry<00:03:43.410> then<00:03:44.010> what

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
inspected and see the symmetry then what

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.640 
inspected and see the symmetry then what
would<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.700> best<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.150> they<00:03:45.359> can<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.380> get<00:03:46.530> them

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
would be best is they can is to get them

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.770 
would be best is they can is to get them
to<00:03:46.769> sit<00:03:46.950> up<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.370> they<00:03:47.669> can't<00:03:48.030> sit<00:03:48.299> up<00:03:48.450> get<00:03:48.720> them

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
to sit up if they can't sit up get them

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.900 
to sit up if they can't sit up get them
to<00:03:48.930> turn<00:03:49.169> over<00:03:49.440> towards<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.579> what<00:03:50.730> you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
want to do is listen to the heart of the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.879 
want to do is listen to the heart of the
lung<00:03:54.269> sounds<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.169> we're<00:03:55.319> just<00:03:55.349> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.680> turn

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
lung sounds so we're just going to turn

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.020 
lung sounds so we're just going to turn
him<00:03:56.130> over<00:03:56.870> okay<00:03:58.069> now<00:03:59.069> what<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.609> want<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.910> do

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
here is you want to find the scapular

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.699 
here is you want to find the scapular
and<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.150> want<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.419> listen<00:04:03.660> inside<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
and you want to listen inside the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.559 
and you want to listen inside the
scapular<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.459> would<00:04:05.730> start<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.269> what<00:04:06.419> I<00:04:06.450> do

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
scapular so I would start and what I do

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.240 
scapular so I would start and what I do
on<00:04:06.840> one<00:04:07.049> side<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.319> want<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.769> do<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.099> other

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
on one side I want to do on the other

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.879 
on one side I want to do on the other
side<00:04:08.549> I'm<00:04:09.060> listening<00:04:09.660> go<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.530> other<00:04:10.680> side

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
side I'm listening go to the other side

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.129 
side I'm listening go to the other side
and<00:04:11.069> stay<00:04:11.459> inside<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.180> scapular<00:04:12.660> stump<00:04:12.989> get

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
and stay inside the scapular stump get

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.390 
and stay inside the scapular stump get
on<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.380> scapular<00:04:13.769> because<00:04:13.950> it's<00:04:14.099> hard<00:04:14.280> to

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
on the scapular because it's hard to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.979 
on the scapular because it's hard to
hear<00:04:14.579> through<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.819> bone<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.269> then<00:04:15.750> just

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
hear through a bone and then just

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.289 
hear through a bone and then just
compare<00:04:16.500> have<00:04:16.979> them<00:04:17.130> take<00:04:17.340> slow<00:04:17.669> deep<00:04:17.700> breaths

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
compare have them take slow deep breaths

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.589 
compare have them take slow deep breaths
now<00:04:19.260> sometimes<00:04:19.829> an<00:04:20.010> older<00:04:20.310> person<00:04:20.760> will<00:04:21.359> take

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
now sometimes an older person will take

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.629 
now sometimes an older person will take
an<00:04:21.750> hyperventilate<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.099> sometimes

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
an hyperventilate on you and sometimes

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.680 
an hyperventilate on you and sometimes
the<00:04:23.760> younger<00:04:23.970> ones<00:04:24.210> too

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
the younger ones too

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.779 
the younger ones too
but<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.169> older<00:04:25.530> person<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:26.099> not<00:04:26.430> able<00:04:26.640> to

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
but the older person is not able to

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.209 
but the older person is not able to
tolerate<00:04:27.030> blowing<00:04:27.539> off<00:04:27.690> all<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.990> co2<00:04:28.229> they

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
tolerate blowing off all that co2 they

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.670 
tolerate blowing off all that co2 they
usually<00:04:29.430> will<00:04:29.760> have<00:04:30.030> like<00:04:30.990> hit<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.380> dizzy

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
usually will have like hit it and dizzy

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.590 
usually will have like hit it and dizzy
it's<00:04:31.800> much<00:04:31.949> quicker<00:04:32.220> than<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.880> younger<00:04:33.180> person

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
it's much quicker than a younger person

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.260 
it's much quicker than a younger person
okay<00:04:33.960> now<00:04:34.530> what<00:04:34.860> we<00:04:34.949> want<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.250> do<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.759> turn<00:04:36.060> them

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
okay now what we want to do is turn them

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.330 
okay now what we want to do is turn them
over<00:04:36.509> you've<00:04:36.840> listened<00:04:37.289> to<00:04:37.320> both<00:04:37.470> sides<00:04:37.830> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
over you've listened to both sides and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.640 
over you've listened to both sides and
now<00:04:38.570> we<00:04:39.570> want<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.840> try<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.080> keep<00:04:40.320> them<00:04:40.440> covered
