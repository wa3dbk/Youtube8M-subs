00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 we were very happy in 2012 when with it 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.320
 fire brigade convention could do everything 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 yield have then but small 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 team did a lot and the story of the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.259
 fire brigade and quadrants 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.029
 can tell the model 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.099
 we are now further and we have 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.050
 jobs described by the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.700
 academy for leadership and talent 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.540
 security regions spread over it 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.120
 country 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.770
 we now have 15 new colleagues 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.470
 can welcome and then we go with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 two teams set to work on a larger one 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.700
 group to take the next step 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.200
 we are going to make a theme 10 I am going with the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.310
 exploration to work and and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.020
 implementation team 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:53.580
 who will help regions and theme team 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.290
 reconnaissance 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.240
 is going to do further research that goes 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.490
 further practical experiences together 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.880
 bring about the way we are 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.579
 explore how we are going 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.530
 signals from the building of the people and 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.270
 of the fire and how 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.770
 let's make a choice for the tactics 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.180
 as it is in the quadrant ii model 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.829
 described 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 the implementation team goes regions 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.360
 help implement the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.150
 quadrant model both with 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 professional competence as with procedures and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.700
 both risk management and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.590
 incident response are two 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.729
 important topic by 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 because of course the model doesn't work 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.120
 just about fighting but the model 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.120
 is also about preventing a fire 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.670
 yes absolutely society is becoming more complex 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.980
 the incidents that we want to prevent 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.750
 and combat become more complex and there 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.360
 we need other ways 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.580
 in line with what we do to the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.620
 also safe and effective in the coming period 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.810
 prevent burning and 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.760
 and that safety is needed 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.560
 is that unfortunately have in recent years 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.360
 a number of accidents have been demonstrated 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.369
 so we will have this sharp 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.580
 to keep it safe and effective 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.580
 stay 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.509
 you see the fire department doctrine and it 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.880
 can then add model to a few places 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.350
 already come back and see the preparation 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.300
 for example the quadrants model 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.530
 tunnels and have risk management and 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.570
 incident management 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.400
 found each other and the fire department doctrine 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.310
 gives a new language to talk together 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.770
 about to complex incidents 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.300
 throw the street and you will see the quadrants 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.680
 modeling exercises and when deploying 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.780
 come back more often 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.850
 this is my way to choose it 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.050
 helps us to be careful 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.180
 and think 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.400
 which tactics we will use with this 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.200
 incident that the war did not all 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.209
 and that will be something for the coming time 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.709
 continue to expand and with each other 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.830
 to see what further need 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.830
 to do 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.650
 yes but it is a difficult concept and 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 for me it is the bookcase in which the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.489
 books are behind the theory 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080
 describe a fire department and then not 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.599
 really in books but in it 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.790
 also examine practical experience 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.319
 on which we base our performance until now 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.060
 we have a lot at the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.500
 fire department doctrine about internal fire 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.300
 the quadrant model is the first 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.709
 result of our doctrine 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.599
 But in the coming years we will too 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.209
 theories and experience other than many 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.470
 record more about water accidents or 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.360
 accident prevention dangerous 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.150
 substances on technical assistance and 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.940
 ultimately an all theory behind it 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.340
 and collect the fire department 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.840
 bring each other together and that becomes difficult 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.230
 begins fire brigade doctrine 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.230
 called 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.349
 This year we will take a number of issues 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.510
 draw attention 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.819
 we get started with exploration and the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.730
 implementation of the Quran 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.410
 the regions we will be visible on 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.269
 the fire brigade congress and we want it 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.069
 organize some workshops 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.989
 actually our goal is that we are this year 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.280
 take steps on it on one side 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.230
 subject exploration 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.880
 we deliver that at the end of the year 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.560
 everyone on risk management and 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.480
 incident prevention really from it 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.400
 know the quadrants model so that we can 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.380
 each other can continue on one 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.380
 safe and effective fire fighting
