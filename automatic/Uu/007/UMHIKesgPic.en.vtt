00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.260
 hello poof finally autumn has arrived 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.990
 yes yes you know that we were bathing 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.990
 again these days of course if that's the 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.810
 south autumn is the real return 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.930
 that of music and this year 2014 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.440
 is really a very great vintage 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.000
 because we have never seen such a choice 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.320
 in the dream instruments 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.710
 keyboard side that drops your off-beat tone 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.710
 brushing 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.600
 the psr 950 and yamaha 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.089
 tea with 900 rope around 1800 euros 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.339
 hardly a newcomer with pea 3 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.339
 xl1 beatable admitted the few euros 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:05.140
 in the tenors the fight at the top 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.140
 between 0.5 and peace at 3x 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.750
 not to forget the keyboard button loggias 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.520
 and the new version of sdf 8 which 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.730
 this time now include 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.160
 the usb interface and therefore reading the 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.320
 audio files 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.760
 these exist in expanders on 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:33.350
 sd 3d the audi a4 and that's where the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:35.780
 little clever at 790 euros just the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.790
 last accordion show had a 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 very wide success and more 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.190

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.580

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.580
 roland 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.140

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.810

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.490
 nice to be a woman 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.860
 I do not know if you noticed 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.840

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.670

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.390
 real revolution in sound 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.100

 I have all the big builders but 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.610

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.620
 small footprint 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.780
 these technologies allow 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.700
 musicians to manage by themselves their 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.370
 show while controlling their 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.110
 own emotions we find more and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.690

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.110
