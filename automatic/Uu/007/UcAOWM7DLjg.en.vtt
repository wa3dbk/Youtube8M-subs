kind of annoying this one that won't
happen<00:02:04.859> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> kind<00:02:05.609> of<00:02:11.060> incredible<00:02:12.060> for

happen this is kind of incredible for
those<00:02:12.810> surfers<00:02:13.410> out<00:02:13.560> there

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.309 

and<00:02:49.790> another<00:02:50.150> feature<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.140> about

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and another feature that I like about

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.149 
and another feature that I like about
the<00:02:51.590> same<00:02:52.629> is<00:02:53.629> that<00:02:53.989> he<00:02:54.200> added<00:02:54.379> Anna<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.010> a

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
the same is that he added Anna just a

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.300 
the same is that he added Anna just a
moment<00:02:55.549> mid-range<00:02:55.900> deluxe<00:02:56.900> River<00:02:57.110> only<00:02:58.099> have

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
moment mid-range deluxe River only have

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.280 
moment mid-range deluxe River only have
bass<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.450> treble<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.650> resistor<00:03:01.519> at<00:03:02.290> 6,800

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
bass and treble and a resistor at 6,800

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.410 
bass and treble and a resistor at 6,800
ohms<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.579> suggests<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.209> mid

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
ohms so this this suggests of a mid

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.690 
ohms so this this suggests of a mid
range<00:03:05.599> because<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.500> can't<00:03:06.739> just<00:03:07.040> be<00:03:07.190> set<00:03:07.549> up

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
range because you can't just be set up

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.020 
range because you can't just be set up

you<00:03:13.489> don't<00:03:13.700> need<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:14.120> lot<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.450> movement<00:03:14.629> with

you don't need a lot of movement with

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.180 
you don't need a lot of movement with
certain<00:03:15.200> guitars<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.650> need<00:03:15.799> more<00:03:15.950> mid-range

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
certain guitars you need more mid-range

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.280 
certain guitars you need more mid-range
more<00:03:16.810> important<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> have<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.769> mid<00:03:19.129> range

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
more important to have that mid range

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.979 
more important to have that mid range
down<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.790> could<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.209> nice<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.629> nice<00:03:23.930> and

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
down you could get nice and nice and

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:42.670 
down you could get nice and nice and
easy<00:03:24.319> nice<00:03:40.810> you're<00:03:41.810> gonna<00:03:41.900> need<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.170> break<00:03:42.470> up

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
easy nice you're gonna need a break up

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.530 
easy nice you're gonna need a break up
and<00:03:42.890> also<00:03:43.099> it's<00:03:43.220> good<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:43.849> usable<00:03:44.329> for<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and also it's good it's usable for the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:04:05.940 
and also it's good it's usable for the
Blues<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:44.930> know<00:03:45.290> like<00:03:45.849> for<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:46.940> solo

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
playing a smaller Club 4k is cleaner

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.570 
playing a smaller Club 4k is cleaner
louder<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.880> K<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.900> breaks<00:04:30.800> up<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.040> little<00:04:31.340> bit

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
could put it on a K and you could it'll

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.580 
could put it on a K and you could it'll
sing<00:04:41.090> more<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.570> could<00:04:41.720> crank<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.350> get<00:04:42.560> a

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
sing more you could crank it and get a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.010 
sing more you could crank it and get a
little<00:04:42.830> more<00:04:43.160> with<00:04:43.729> that<00:04:43.850> Bruce<00:04:44.150> its<00:04:44.360> own<00:04:44.510> that
