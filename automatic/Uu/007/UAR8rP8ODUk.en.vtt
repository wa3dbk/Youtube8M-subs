00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.780
 still I was not enough that you m 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.820
 the second video 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.009
 I wanted a little more and more of 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.110
 people see it so today everything from 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.390
 Following the episode of lega same principle 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.970
 that day if I reach a number of 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.740
 I like exceptional once again you 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.009
 after not too many nc like you and 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.900
 so I leave you right away to 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.909
 following the video for episode 2 ha 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.590
 and immediately 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.960
 so we end up for the second 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.210
 match of the amazing hulk and like you 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.479
 see it we have a new trio 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.020
 offensive with isc or of course I have 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.150
 who is very good with i'm going to teach and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.979
 so your cost is llorente which costs 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.600
 really cheap 650 credit this data 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.220
 so we left for a cut of 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.450
 gold so I hope this time we 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.159
 will have a little luck is that we 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.180
 will try to win the match because the 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.670
 first match is still quite a 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.610
 match and to that pure to have fun when he 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.950
 there was no dangerous before so we 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.409
 found an opponent we end up 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.659
 constrained from lull chelsea tension 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.840

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.220

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.580
 watch two shots framed for two 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.540
 third this not bad we have the possession of the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.670
 var against one roll is above the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.080
 level of shooting it's going to be hard to hold 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.730
 I'm telling you for now we're 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.060
 well 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:02.250

 clichy will get nicked for the keystroke 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.780

 number making boom boom man of the match 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.750
 the cisse keeper who knows that it's 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.880

 guy so I won the match 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.460
 a disagreement he did not score a goal 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.690
 so I have the right to choose a player from 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.340
 his team and I do not tell you which one I 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.140
 will choose you will have the surprise in 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.780
 the next match 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.940
 you'll see right away so ok 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.090
 at once for the surprise so we 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.710
 resumes competition in quarter of 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.210
 final since we won the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.800
 round of 16 and see who has 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.840
 made his appearance in the team he 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.880
 this is petr 7 ch simply 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.080
 because my opponent did not have 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.490
 managed to score two goals and I had 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.110
 won the match so I just 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.790
 the right to choose a player and I 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.680
 am told as much choosing a guardian 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.350
 from the outset to consolidate a 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.060
 good base team so I start 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.710
 make me a small team like that I 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.100
 still half of the players 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.660
 bronze 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.570
 but it does not matter we hope when 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.720
 even got to heat other players 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.390
 we will see what we are offered on 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.940
 falls against a bp team with 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:54.830
 torres has no schollen nasri does there and 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.910
 half it's okay it's not very very expensive yes 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.200
 when there is no collective 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.800
 ballesteros checks it's 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.200
 really pitiful hulk oh there up there 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.030
 but what are you doing here they do not judge 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.650

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.180
 on the other hand there without collective do not know what 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.890
 that it can give free kicks 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.120

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.419
