00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
math i culture they did not like the

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.170 
math i culture they did not like the
idea<00:05:31.979> do<00:05:32.979> they<00:05:33.039> stay<00:05:33.460> they<00:05:33.699> have<00:05:33.729> to<00:05:33.970> go<00:05:34.090> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
idea do they stay they have to go and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.210 
idea do they stay they have to go and
find<00:05:34.389> like<00:05:34.599> a<00:05:34.630> terrible<00:05:35.349> kids<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:35.830> they

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
find like a terrible kids that they

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.879 
find like a terrible kids that they
think<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:37.750> then<00:05:37.930> they<00:05:38.080> send<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.740> that

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
think that and then they send it to that

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.219 
think that and then they send it to that
will<00:05:39.280> they<00:05:39.400> say<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.849> but<00:05:40.539> now<00:05:40.570> they<00:05:40.960> started

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
will they say that but now they started

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.749 
will they say that but now they started
realizing<00:05:41.380> after<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:42.130> school<00:05:42.490> is<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.729> most
