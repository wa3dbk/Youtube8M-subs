we<00:00:00.930> have<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.110> question<00:00:01.410> from<00:00:01.680> James<00:00:02.040> Knutson<00:00:02.820> is

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
we have a question from James Knutson is

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.559 
we have a question from James Knutson is
there<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.710> correct<00:00:05.250> way<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.549> set<00:00:06.029> up<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.240> steering

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
there a correct way to set up a steering

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.629 
there a correct way to set up a steering
damper<00:00:06.950> it's<00:00:07.950> actually<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> really<00:00:08.460> good

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
damper it's actually a really good

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.190 
damper it's actually a really good
question<00:00:08.790> because<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.210> lot<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.480> bikes<00:00:09.690> come

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
question because a lot of bikes come

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.220 
question because a lot of bikes come
with<00:00:10.800> them<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:12.059> non<00:00:12.330> adjustable<00:00:13.019> in

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
with them some are non adjustable in

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
with them some are non adjustable in
that<00:00:13.590> they<00:00:13.740> reside<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.429> there's<00:00:14.940> no

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that they reside there there's no

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.930 
that they reside there there's no
external<00:00:15.509> adjustments<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.580> there's<00:00:17.580> nothing

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
external adjustments and there's nothing

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.429 
external adjustments and there's nothing
you<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.480> them<00:00:18.600> some<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.260> not

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
you can do with them some are not

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
you can do with them some are not
adjustable<00:00:19.949> because<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> ECU<00:00:21.060> decides<00:00:21.510> what

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
adjustable because the ECU decides what

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.290 
adjustable because the ECU decides what
they're<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.949> John<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.490> regards

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
they're going to do so John and regards

they're going to do so John and regards
to<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.570> question<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> depends<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
to your question it depends what you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.550 
to your question it depends what you
have<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> getting<00:00:27.420> into<00:00:27.660> steering<00:00:28.170> dampers

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
have so getting into steering dampers

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890 
have so getting into steering dampers
there<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:29.010> kinds<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.390> rotary

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
there are two kinds there are rotary

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.569 
there are two kinds there are rotary
canes<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.349> sit<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.679> top<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.070> your<00:00:32.369> upper

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
canes that sit on top of your upper

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
canes that sit on top of your upper
triple<00:00:32.880> clamp<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.690> linear<00:00:34.079> kinds

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
triple clamp and there are linear kinds

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.370 
triple clamp and there are linear kinds
which<00:00:35.340> sit<00:00:35.700> either<00:00:35.969> across<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> tank<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.140> from

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
which sit either across the tank or from

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.369 
which sit either across the tank or from
the<00:00:37.500> frame<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> forks<00:00:39.180> where<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.140> move

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the frame to the forks where they move

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.150 
the frame to the forks where they move
backwards<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.100> forwards<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.670> linear<00:00:41.910> way

backwards and forwards in a linear way

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
backwards and forwards in a linear way
it's<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.370> better<00:00:44.579> than<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> other<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:45.719> not

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it's one better than the other no not

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
it's one better than the other no not
really<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> question<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.280> personal

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
really it's all a question of personal

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.639 
really it's all a question of personal
choice<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.300> don't<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.770> both<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.789> I

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
choice I don't think so I have both so I

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
choice I don't think so I have both so I
have<00:00:52.649> never<00:00:52.980> found<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.730> better<00:00:53.910> than

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
have never found one to be better than

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.229 
have never found one to be better than
the<00:00:54.270> other<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:55.070> terms<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.309> setting<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.850> damper

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the other in terms of setting the damper

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.139 
the other in terms of setting the damper
if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.379> spend<00:00:58.710> most<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> time<00:00:59.160> around

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
if you spend most of the time around

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
if you spend most of the time around
town<00:01:00.570> doing<00:01:01.440> quick<00:01:01.680> turns<00:01:01.920> trying<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.520> the

town doing quick turns trying to get the
bike<00:01:02.760> around<00:01:03.120> quickly<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.260> don't<00:01:04.500> want

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
bike around quickly then you don't want

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800 
bike around quickly then you don't want
much<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> steering<00:01:05.580> damper<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.060> terms<00:01:06.360> of

much on the steering damper in terms of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.980 
much on the steering damper in terms of
its<00:01:07.200> tension<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:09.330> need<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> able<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
its tension you need to be able to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
its tension you need to be able to
maneuver<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> bike<00:01:10.920> quickly<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.760> your

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
maneuver the bike quickly if your

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.780 
maneuver the bike quickly if your
steering<00:01:12.780> damper<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.470> set<00:01:13.799> too<00:01:14.010> aggressively

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
steering damper is set too aggressively

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
steering damper is set too aggressively
then<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> need<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> way

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
then if you need to get out of the way

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
then if you need to get out of the way
or<00:01:16.890> something<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.460> fortunately<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.390> be

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
or something or fortunately you will be

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
or something or fortunately you will be
able<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> bars<00:01:19.860> won't<00:01:20.159> move<00:01:20.400> fast

able to because the bars won't move fast

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
able to because the bars won't move fast
enough<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.689> hear<00:01:21.990> -<00:01:22.200> whatever

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
enough and you will hear - whatever

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.219 
enough and you will hear - whatever
you're<00:01:22.740> trying<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> avoid<00:01:23.840> however<00:01:24.840> once<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you're trying to avoid however once you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
you're trying to avoid however once you
get<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> racetrack<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.610> you're<00:01:26.729> doing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
get out on the racetrack if you're doing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
get out on the racetrack if you're doing
a<00:01:26.970> track<00:01:27.180> day<00:01:27.330> racing<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.650> point<00:01:28.979> then

a track day racing at that point then

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.830 
a track day racing at that point then
you<00:01:29.369> should<00:01:29.579> turn<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.820> steering<00:01:30.329> damper<00:01:30.479> up

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you should turn the steering damper up

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
you should turn the steering damper up
to<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.740> useful<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.540> bottom

handling problem that will be just the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
handling problem that will be just the
same<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:56.880> turning<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.390> radio<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.409> the

great deal of harm if you insist on

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.380 
great deal of harm if you insist on

into<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> tuner<00:02:40.840> like<00:02:40.959> me<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.320> tell<00:02:41.500> me<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
into a tuner like me and tell me the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.680 
into a tuner like me and tell me the
bike<00:02:41.890> won't<00:02:42.160> turn<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.760> reach<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.239> handlebars

and<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.020> steering's<00:02:44.500> locked<00:02:44.920> because<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
and the steering's locked because the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.449 
and the steering's locked because the
damper<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.209> stiff<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.650> again<00:02:47.860> common<00:02:48.280> sense

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
damper is so stiff so again common sense

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.009 
damper is so stiff so again common sense
