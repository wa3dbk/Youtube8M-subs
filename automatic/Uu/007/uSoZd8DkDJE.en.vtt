00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.470 
might as well play the whole game on the
time<00:02:35.300> too<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.020> first<00:02:36.590> heard<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.070> game<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.730> 60

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
time too I first heard the game was 60

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.300 
time too I first heard the game was 60
minutes<00:02:38.780> long<00:02:38.989> with<00:02:39.530> 20<00:02:39.920> minutes<00:02:40.070> for

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
minutes long with 20 minutes for

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.670 
minutes long with 20 minutes for
halftime<00:02:40.550> which<00:02:41.450> sounds<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.050> reasonable

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
halftime which sounds like a reasonable

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.550 
halftime which sounds like a reasonable
length<00:02:43.070> but<00:02:43.820> no<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:44.420> actually<00:02:44.600> way<00:02:45.170> longer

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
length but no it's actually way longer

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.340 
length but no it's actually way longer
because<00:02:46.130> they<00:02:46.340> keep<00:02:46.550> stopping<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> clock

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
because they keep stopping the clock

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.800 
because they keep stopping the clock
we've<00:02:48.350> stayed<00:02:48.739> for<00:02:49.070> over<00:02:49.280> two<00:02:49.910> hours<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
we've stayed for over two hours and the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.420 
we've stayed for over two hours and the
game<00:02:50.989> was<00:02:51.110> only<00:02:51.350> three<00:02:51.830> quarters<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> way

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
game was only three quarters of the way

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.729 
game was only three quarters of the way
through<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.630> then<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.930> decided<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.560> just

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
through and then I decided I just

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.650 
through and then I decided I just
couldn't<00:02:55.220> handle<00:02:55.580> watching<00:02:55.910> sport<00:02:56.420> any

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
couldn't handle watching sport any

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.960 
couldn't handle watching sport any
longer<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.350> called<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.800> day<00:02:57.830> when<00:02:58.820> we

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
longer so we called it a day when we

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.820 
longer so we called it a day when we
left<00:02:59.180> i'm<00:02:59.360> pretty<00:02:59.570> sure<00:02:59.780> arcadia<00:03:00.290> was<00:03:00.470> winning

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
left i'm pretty sure arcadia was winning

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.410 
left i'm pretty sure arcadia was winning
but<00:03:01.100> i<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.370> checked<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> score<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.239> net

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
but i just checked the score on the net

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.880 
but i just checked the score on the net
and<00:03:02.600> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
and the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:19.590 
and the
no<00:03:03.040> score<00:03:03.370> was<00:03:03.520> 4012<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> Huskies<00:03:05.380> Wow
