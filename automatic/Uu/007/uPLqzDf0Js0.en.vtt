00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 now I'm going to do this exercise of 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:09.650
 complex numbers is the first subject of 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.700
 calculation or one of engineering in uji 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 with which I want you can come 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 well enough from the exams is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.140
 an almost certain question so let's 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 see how this would be done worth this is a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.240
 equation that as you can see has a format 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 a little weird because he has the fifth 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 minus four minus four equals zero 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 Ok, it does not have an X as we are 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
 used in normal equations 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 this is an equation with numbers 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 complex then when we have this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 situation the first thing to do 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.160
 is to clear the zeta vale then let's go 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.610
 Let's see 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.380
 we are from here the zeta 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.180
 and to clear it we passed what we do not know 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.730
 does it's on the other side of equality 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.730
 with which we would be 44 and 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.610
 and now to clear the gazette we would give 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.120
 the fifth root of what we have left 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.120
 on the right 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 take here 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 OK 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.780
 in order now you have to do a root 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.030
 fifth complex number to do the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.590
 root you know that the first thing that you have to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 to do is to convert is a complex number 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.910
 which is in dynamic form convert it to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 polar form 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.210
 if we do not represent it to make us an 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.700
 idea the fixed of this complex number 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 would be in the first quadrant you put and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.980
 here is the 4 in the X's and here is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 the 4 in the siss I remember that the x axis 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.500
 equals the real part and the y-axis 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.049
 equip the imaginary part 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.649
 then it would be a vector more or less and 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.649
 this would be acceptable 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 and it's still not going to be 45 degrees that is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 You can know but let's calculate everything 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
 is worth the format of a complex number in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.970
 polar form is a first part that is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 called module that is what this would measure 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 complex number behind a part that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.250
 would the argument not be called the alpha 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 then we will get to put it in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.700
 this form 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.610
 to take out the module we are going to do 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.590
 the square root of the real part to 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.850
 square plus the imaginary part to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.860
 square eye here does not get the and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.500
 only the coefficient between 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.390
 say quotes from the and that is 4 us 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 take the and to put here in the module 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.980
 typical error of many large 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.180
 following 32 which is the same as root of 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.300
 two raised to the fifth 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.569
 to know the alpha argument worth 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.680
 we are going to have to do 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:39.450
 the tangent to the minus 1 or the inverse of 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.599
 the tangent of the imaginary part 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.060
 party the real part that is this 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.319
 here this example is a bit weird because 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.549
 the real part in the imaginary part 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.180
 they agree but I do not want there to be 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.750
 confusion why this is this and this the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.310
 denominator is the real part 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.910
 whereupon it comes out that the angle 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.310
 it would be 45 degrees 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.240
 then reviewing a bit of root from 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.650
 complex numbers a complex number 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.210
 which is done a root will have so many 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.350
 solutions like the beginning of the root e 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.270
 indicate with what is how we are 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.090
 doing a fifth root we would have 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.670
 five solutions 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.510
 I'm going to take the 5 solutions and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.510
 I will place them here 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.440
 for each equal to zero 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.489
 equal to zero we will have the first 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.810
 solution z equal to zero for here equal to 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.390
 1 we will have a second solution 01 for 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.480
 here equality 2 we will have a third 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.560
 solution z 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.560
 02 sorry 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.580
 OK 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.290
 the measure and if because here you put here 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:05.430
 is a parameter are real numbers ones 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.540
 integers that we have to assign in this one 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.540
 formulita from here 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.060
 OK 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.790
 I explain 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.290
 these are the different arguments that 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.829
 let's get for each of the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.800
 five solutions that we have here is worth 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.919
 then the first argument alpha what 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.580
 we will calculate assigning here a value of 0 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.970
 the second the second solution or zetas 1 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.330
 we will calculate it assigning here here equal 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.710
 to 1 and so on this here 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.470
 it is always the same, this angle is 45 Â° 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.850
 comes from the inverse tangent of 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.190
 Tangent at least one of which 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.070
 we just calculated before and this 5 of 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.870
 here comes from the root index 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.540
 that is from here 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.790
 agree that we do the fourth root to 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.480
 break a 4 we make the cube root 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.480
 here there will be a 360 here is always the same 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.390
 and this angle comes from the tangent to 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.880
 minus 1 that we have calculated here is worth 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.270
 then we have to have five 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.960
 solutions have we left then 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.010
 the part of the module is going to be the same 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.010
 for all solutions 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.180
 It is always the same length as the 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.180
 vector for all 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.390
 I speak of vectors but this really is 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.920
 the representation of a complex number 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.550
 that looks a lot and so what 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.409
 You understand , I do not say it like that 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.649
 if I take 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:52.630
 I put equal to zero here in alpha 

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:54.880
 if you calculate it they will give nine degrees 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.570
 society to first the first argument 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.220
 as argued putting here equal to 1 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.220
 we will leave 81 degrees 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.220
 153 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:10.070
 225 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.440
 and 297 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.320
 and you with calculators give those 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.750
 five solutions I remind you that the 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.530
 five solutions of a root d 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.310
 this complex number have to be 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.930
 equidistant as to angle it 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.800
 I mean the angle separation that 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.690
 There are between each of the solutions 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.530
 It has to be constant if you pick up 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:37.970
 say the difference between 81 and 9 come out 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.970
 72 degrees I think 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.140
 if they have to be the same difference 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:49.530
 that there are in 353 and 81 and the same 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.390
 72 degree difference between 225 and 153 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.520
 so if we represent all 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.710
 the solutions has to be a 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.290
 first solution here others a solution 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:03.030
 more or less here this is all approximate 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:05.850
 around here one here and the other more or 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.060
 less something like that equidistant from 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:13.290
 here here 72 72 degrees 72 degrees 72 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.730
 degrees and 72 degrees is worth then zetas 1 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.320
 it would be this zeta solution 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:21.320
 0 sorry then zetas 1 we would have here 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.320
 2. 3 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:25.489
 and that's it for more information we 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.859
 you can put in the web page that I leave 

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:29.809
 down here in the description of the video or 

00:07:27.859 --> 00:07:32.349
 you can subscribe to the channel I will go up 

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:32.349
 more little things
