00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
next up is a Disney movie this is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.029 
next up is a Disney movie this is
actually<00:04:44.569> only<00:04:44.719> ten<00:04:44.960> dollars<00:04:45.379> and<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:45.770> a

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
actually only ten dollars and it's a

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.600 
actually only ten dollars and it's a
goofy<00:04:46.400> movie<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:47.169> used<00:04:48.169> to<00:04:48.289> watch<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:48.860> on<00:04:49.039> VHS

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
goofy movie I used to watch this on VHS

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.990 
goofy movie I used to watch this on VHS
when<00:04:49.819> I<00:04:49.879> was<00:04:50.029> a<00:04:50.090> kid<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.569> I<00:04:51.729> finally<00:04:52.729> found<00:04:52.849> it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
when I was a kid and I finally found it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.309 
when I was a kid and I finally found it
for<00:04:53.090> just<00:04:53.240> ten<00:04:53.449> dollars<00:04:53.810> were<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.110> kind<00:04:54.289> of

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
for just ten dollars were just kind of

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.320 
for just ten dollars were just kind of
surprising<00:04:54.919> since<00:04:55.069> it's<00:04:55.279> a<00:04:55.400> Disney<00:04:55.879> movie<00:04:55.909> and

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
surprising since it's a Disney movie and

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.510 
surprising since it's a Disney movie and
they<00:04:56.389> tend<00:04:56.629> to<00:04:56.689> go<00:04:56.870> for<00:04:57.129> pretty<00:04:58.129> expensive

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
they tend to go for pretty expensive

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.059 
they tend to go for pretty expensive
prices<00:04:59.000> but<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.750> went<00:05:00.500> ahead<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.740> got<00:05:00.860> this

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
prices but I went ahead and got this

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.909 
prices but I went ahead and got this
because<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.430> was<00:05:01.520> preachy<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:03.500> hadn't<00:05:03.770> seen

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
because it was preachy and I hadn't seen

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.350 
because it was preachy and I hadn't seen
it<00:05:04.039> in<00:05:04.069> forever<00:05:04.219> and<00:05:04.550> i<00:05:04.610> recently<00:05:04.879> watched<00:05:05.180> it

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
it in forever and i recently watched it

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.029 
it in forever and i recently watched it
again<00:05:05.449> and<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.289> wasn't<00:05:06.590> as<00:05:06.680> good<00:05:06.830> as<00:05:06.979> i

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
again and it wasn't as good as i

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.240 
again and it wasn't as good as i
remember<00:05:07.490> but<00:05:07.759> it<00:05:07.969> still<00:05:08.240> wasn't<00:05:08.449> bad<00:05:09.250> it's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
remember but it still wasn't bad it's

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.700 
remember but it still wasn't bad it's
about<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.629> goofy<00:05:11.629> of<00:05:11.779> course<00:05:12.050> who<00:05:12.229> we<00:05:12.349> all<00:05:12.379> know
