filling it with ink and so on but the
problem<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.989> their<00:00:37.230> toilet<00:00:37.770> rolls<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.250> they

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
problem with their toilet rolls is they

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060 
problem with their toilet rolls is they
are<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:38.910> rules<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.440> roll<00:00:40.739> about

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
are actually rules and they roll about

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.959 
are actually rules and they roll about
and<00:00:41.899> inevitably<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.140> will<00:00:43.399> get<00:00:44.399> ink<00:00:44.700> or

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and inevitably you will get ink or

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.130 
and inevitably you will get ink or
something<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.629> hand<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.989> your

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
something all over your hand and your

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.779 
something all over your hand and your
snatch<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> toilet<00:00:47.010> roll<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.670> will

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
snatch at the toilet roll and it will

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
snatch at the toilet roll and it will
take<00:00:48.059> orbit<00:00:48.480> and/or<00:00:48.960> fly<00:00:49.260> across<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
take orbit and/or fly across the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
take orbit and/or fly across the
workshop<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.030> thinking<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.780> do

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
workshop so it's thinking how can I do

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
workshop so it's thinking how can I do
something<00:00:52.230> about<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
something about this how can I make a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.360 
something about this how can I make a
dispenser<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:54.449> neato<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.039> answer

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
dispenser that's neato and the answer

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.619 
dispenser that's neato and the answer
was<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.870> initially<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.109> couldn't<00:00:59.629> unravel

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
was that initially you couldn't unravel

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
was that initially you couldn't unravel
the<00:01:00.750> inside<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> roll<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.710> toilet<00:01:01.890> paper<00:01:02.070> or

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the inside of a roll of toilet paper or

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.009 
the inside of a roll of toilet paper or
toilet<00:01:03.000> tissue<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.600> sometimes<00:01:03.780> called

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
toilet tissue as it's sometimes called

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.920 
toilet tissue as it's sometimes called
in<00:01:04.409> posh<00:01:05.010> parts<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> world<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
in posh parts of the world and when you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
in posh parts of the world and when you
unroll<00:01:07.580> unravel<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> middle<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.270> then

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
unroll unravel the middle you can then

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.440 
unroll unravel the middle you can then
feed<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.890> toilet<00:01:11.580> paper<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> middle

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
feed the toilet paper from the middle

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
feed the toilet paper from the middle
and<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.080> comes<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.650> neater<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and it comes out a lot neater and it's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
and it comes out a lot neater and it's
more<00:01:14.549> less<00:01:14.790> prone<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> rolling<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
more less prone to rolling about but I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.140 
more less prone to rolling about but I
thought<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.220> must<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.490> some<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
thought there must be some way I can

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
thought there must be some way I can
make<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.330> neater<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.890> answer<00:01:20.280> was

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
make this neater and the answer was

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.149 
make this neater and the answer was
there<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.150> actually<00:01:21.360> an<00:01:21.680> Poundland<00:01:22.680> today<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
there was actually an Poundland today a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.420 
there was actually an Poundland today a
british<00:01:23.909> dollar<00:01:24.150> store<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.840> saw<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> nice

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
british dollar store and I saw this nice

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.859 
british dollar store and I saw this nice
Tupperware<00:01:26.430> stall<00:01:26.729> container<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.390> say

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
Tupperware stall container I say

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.719 
Tupperware stall container I say
Tupperware<00:01:28.320> style<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:29.040> obviously<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
Tupperware style because obviously in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.010 
Tupperware style because obviously in
Poundland<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.780> proper

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
Poundland you don't get proper

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
Poundland you don't get proper
Tupperware<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.920> they're<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.369> generic

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
Tupperware it's they're just generic

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.020 
Tupperware it's they're just generic
stuff<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.579> size<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
stuff so this is just the right size to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
stuff so this is just the right size to
take<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.360> roll<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> toilet<00:01:36.960> tissue<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> got

take a roll of toilet tissue so I got

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
take a roll of toilet tissue so I got
the<00:01:38.790> soldier<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.600> melted<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.079> hole<00:01:40.110> man

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the soldier on and I melted a hole man

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
the soldier on and I melted a hole man
now<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> advantage<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.729> soldier<00:01:42.119> iron<00:01:42.240> from

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
now the advantage of a soldier iron from

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
now the advantage of a soldier iron from
melting<00:01:42.810> holes<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> plastic<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
melting holes in the plastic like this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
melting holes in the plastic like this
is<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.450> plastic<00:01:45.930> tends<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.320> quite

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
is this plastic tends to be quite

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.280 
is this plastic tends to be quite
brittle<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.640> shatter<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.659> crack<00:01:48.990> when

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
brittle and it can shatter or crack when

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
hole and there it feeds conveniently at

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.130 
hole and there it feeds conveniently at
the<00:02:34.980> end<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.860> can<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.340> stood<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.140> it's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the end and can be stood up and it's
