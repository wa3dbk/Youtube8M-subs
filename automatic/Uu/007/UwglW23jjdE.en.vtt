time there's all that one title upstairs
you<00:03:06.230> can<00:03:06.380> see<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.830> problems<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.430> my

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
you can see the problems of that my

here

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.479 
here
I<00:03:14.660> mean<00:03:15.410> Huff<00:03:15.620> does<00:03:15.769> one<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:15.980> these<00:03:16.010> pushes

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
I mean Huff does one of these pushes

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.380 
I mean Huff does one of these pushes
before<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:18.820> apart<00:03:19.820> from<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.030> drinking<00:03:20.360> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
before and apart from the drinking the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.870 
before and apart from the drinking the
salt<00:03:20.630> water<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.380> actual<00:03:21.680> feel<00:03:22.430> innovators

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
salt water the actual feel innovators

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.720 
salt water the actual feel innovators
are<00:03:22.970> brilliant<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:24.140> reason<00:03:24.440> why<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:25.100> such

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
are brilliant the reason why it is such

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.490 
are brilliant the reason why it is such
a<00:03:25.760> good<00:03:26.000> cleanser<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.630> because<00:03:26.989> when<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.350> mix

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
a good cleanser is because when you mix

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.640 
a good cleanser is because when you mix
a<00:03:27.650> salt<00:03:27.860> water<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:29.690> creates<00:03:30.110> exactly<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
a salt water it it's creates exactly the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.250 
a salt water it it's creates exactly the
same<00:03:30.890> thickness<00:03:31.160> as<00:03:31.400> your<00:03:31.519> blood<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:32.720> when<00:03:33.170> it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
same thickness as your blood so when it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.569 
same thickness as your blood so when it
goes<00:03:33.350> into<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.709> stomach<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.190> can't<00:03:34.400> go

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
goes into the stomach it can't go

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.770 
goes into the stomach it can't go
through<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> stomach<00:03:35.120> wall<00:03:35.450> into<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
through the stomach wall into the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.660 
through the stomach wall into the
bloodstream<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.530> flushes<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.190> out<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.519> other

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
bloodstream it flushes it out the other

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.910 
bloodstream it flushes it out the other
end<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.120> takes<00:03:38.329> everything<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.620> you

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
end but it takes everything with it you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.170 
end but it takes everything with it you
know<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.070> mean<00:03:40.130> everything<00:03:40.519> that's<00:03:40.820> stuck<00:03:41.030> in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
know I mean everything that's stuck in

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.330 
know I mean everything that's stuck in
the<00:03:41.269> colon<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.470> completely<00:03:42.860> cleans<00:03:43.220> it

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
the colon it just completely cleans it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.390 
the colon it just completely cleans it
out<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.299> usually<00:03:44.540> takes<00:03:44.780> an<00:03:45.590> hour<00:03:45.769> after

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
out and it usually takes an hour after

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.590 
out and it usually takes an hour after
