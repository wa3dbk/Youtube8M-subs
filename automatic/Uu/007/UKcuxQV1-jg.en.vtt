00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.302
 "Prostate Cancer Survival: Å½ / R Ratio" 

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:11.290
 Now it is eight years since the publication of the famous Ornish study, 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.939
 which showed that 12 months on a strict plant diet 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.672
 was able to stop the development of prostate cancer. 

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:21.705
 Wait. 

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.806
 How did they get a group of older men, 

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:25.751
 to eat vegan all year long? 

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:29.207
 They delivered their prepared meals to the house, 

00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:31.433
 for they assumed that men were so lazy, 

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.937
 that they simply eat everything they lay before them. 

00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:37.594
 But what in the real world? 

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:40.508
 Because most men with cancer don't even make it 

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.374
 to eat a miserable five servings of fruits and vegetables a day 

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:47.823
 scientists have only decided to change their ratio of Z to R, 

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:50.591
 that is, the ratio of animal and vegetable proteins, 

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.990
 and indeed they have managed to reduce this ratio by at least half 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.025
 from about 2 to 1 animal / vegetable protein to something near half to vegan, 1 to 1. 

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.428
 How did you do it? 

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.659
 Their cancer seems to have slowed down. 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.923
 "Average PSA doubling time 

00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:10.557
 (estimate the rate at which tumor size can double) 

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:11.969
 in that partially vegan group 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.266
 from 21 months to 58 months. 

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.163
 So the cancer has grown, 

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:19.403
 But it seemed to be using diet based largely on plant foods 

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:22.533
 tumor enlargement was possible 

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.134
 slow down. 

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:26.325
 But what was published by dr. Ornish, that was obvious 

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.001
 twist in cancer growth 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.902
 PSA not only did not grow slower 

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:33.302
 even decreased, 

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:36.033
 which could be a sign of tumor shrinkage. 

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:41.530
 So the ideal ratio of Z to R can be closer to zero. 

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.410
 If there is no chance of getting a vegan from a grandfather 

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:47.040
 and we'll get halfway, 

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.900
 what can be the worst w and the best r? 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.790
 The eggs and poultry are probably the worst 

00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:57.730
 eggs doubled 

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:00.300
 and poultry increased fourfold 

00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:03.940
 the risk of cancer progression, as shown by this Harvard study. 

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:07.770
 Double the risk of consuming less than one egg a day 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.220
 four times the risk of consuming less 

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:12.230
 than single portions of chicken or turkeys. 

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:15.420
 And if you could only add one thing to your diet, 

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:17.400
 it would be a brassica vegetable. 

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.540
 Less than one serving a day 

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:21.170
 broccoli or Brussels sprouts 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.300
 cabbage, cauliflower or cabbage 

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:26.460
 can reduce the risk of cancer progression by more than half 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.870
 defined as the return of cancer, 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.800
 spreading to bone or death. 

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:35.740
 This ratio of animal and plant proteins could be useful 

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:38.700
 for cancer prevention. 

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:41.150
 For example, in the largest study ever made, 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.800
 about diet and bladder cancer, 

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.960
 only a 3% increase in animal protein consumption 

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:52.070
 associated with a 15% increase in bladder cancer risk 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.020
 while a 2% increase in plant protein intake 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.130
 associated with a 33% risk reduction. 

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.820
 Even minor changes in our diet 

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.630
 may have significant effects.
