00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
ones in the wrong place well if I was

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.280 
ones in the wrong place well if I was
using<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.600> little<00:03:03.840> tray<00:03:04.110> with<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
using the little tray with the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.960 
using the little tray with the
separators<00:03:04.860> I'd<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.310> move<00:03:05.520> all<00:03:05.760> those

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
separators I'd have to move all those

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
separators I'd have to move all those
pens<00:03:06.270> over<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.990> just<00:03:07.140> slide<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.620> right

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
pens over but I can just slide it right

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.890 
pens over but I can just slide it right
in<00:03:08.010> there<00:03:08.220> right<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.060> works<00:03:09.240> for<00:03:09.360> both<00:03:09.480> of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
in there right so it works for both of

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.810 
in there right so it works for both of
those<00:03:10.080> sides<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.590> pens<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> also<00:03:11.370> works

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
those sides of pens but it also works

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.140 
those sides of pens but it also works
great<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:13.680> bit<00:03:13.770> longer<00:03:14.160> zig<00:03:14.850> type

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
great for the little bit longer zig type

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.100 
great for the little bit longer zig type
pens<00:03:16.220> now<00:03:17.220> depending<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.090> how<00:03:18.300> thick<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.870> pen

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
pens now depending on how thick the pen

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.500 
pens now depending on how thick the pen
is<00:03:19.380> how<00:03:19.830> big<00:03:20.040> around<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.330> get

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
is how big around it is you can get

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.350 
is how big around it is you can get
obviously<00:03:21.750> more<00:03:22.320> or<00:03:22.590> less<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.150> big

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
obviously more or less in so the big

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.940 
obviously more or less in so the big
octagon<00:03:24.989> shaped<00:03:25.800> pens<00:03:26.160> are<00:03:27.530> take<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.739> little

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
octagon shaped pens are take up a little

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.880 
octagon shaped pens are take up a little
bit<00:03:29.100> more<00:03:29.280> room<00:03:30.560> bend<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.770> thinner<00:03:32.130> Zig<00:03:32.580> pens

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.560 

as<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.040> can<00:03:38.190> see<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:38.760> easy<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.270> just<00:03:39.390> line

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
as you can see it's so easy to just line

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.479 
as you can see it's so easy to just line
them<00:03:39.660> up<00:03:39.720> now<00:03:40.170> because<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:40.739> staggered<00:03:41.280> they

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
them up now because it's staggered they

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.610 
them up now because it's staggered they
all<00:03:41.670> stick<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.330> little<00:03:42.600> bit<00:03:42.989> further<00:03:43.350> as

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
all stick out a little bit further as

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.340 
all stick out a little bit further as
you<00:03:43.860> go<00:03:44.100> down<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.580> row<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.870> really<00:03:46.230> easy

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
you go down the row so it's really easy

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.770 
you go down the row so it's really easy
to<00:03:46.830> pull<00:03:47.160> them<00:03:47.400> out<00:03:47.580> as<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.330> need<00:03:48.510> them
