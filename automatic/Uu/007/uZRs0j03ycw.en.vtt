00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
bother trying it's still a waste of the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.680 
bother trying it's still a waste of the
next<00:00:10.590> year<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.639> fun<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:12.179> if<00:00:12.480> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
next year but just for fun really if we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.709 
next year but just for fun really if we
can<00:00:12.809> get<00:00:12.960> half<00:00:13.349> roughly<00:00:14.190> half<00:00:14.549> wall<00:00:15.330> breakers

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
can get half roughly half wall breakers

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.230 
can get half roughly half wall breakers
max<00:00:16.379> several<00:00:16.710> wall<00:00:16.859> breakers<00:00:17.220> roughly<00:00:18.060> half

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
max several wall breakers roughly half

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.179 
max several wall breakers roughly half
maximal<00:00:18.990> goblins<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.160> just

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
maximal goblins and then we're just

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.800 
maximal goblins and then we're just
gonna<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:20.699> fun<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:21.180> that's<00:00:21.689> what

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
gonna have some fun really that's what

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.529 
gonna have some fun really that's what
the<00:00:21.900> games<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.330> here<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.390> go

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the games all about right so here we go

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.130 
the games all about right so here we go
with<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.439> 103<00:00:26.240> wall<00:00:27.240> breakers<00:00:27.570> five<00:00:27.779> star<00:00:28.019> wall

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
with a 103 wall breakers five star wall

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.840 
with a 103 wall breakers five star wall
breakers<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.070> 117<00:00:29.880> goblins<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.080> idea<00:00:31.199> is

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
breakers and 117 goblins so the idea is

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
breakers and 117 goblins so the idea is
destroy<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.090> much<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.570> possibly<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
destroy as much as we possibly can and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
destroy as much as we possibly can and
get<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.250> gold<00:00:35.510> let's<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:39.079> find

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
get some gold let's go have a look find

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.770 
get some gold let's go have a look find
a<00:00:40.170> match

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
how do we got there five no I don't

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.799 
how do we got there five no I don't
think<00:00:48.680> that<00:00:48.710> we<00:00:48.890> were<00:00:49.039> that<00:00:49.219> you<00:00:51.340> 13<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:52.610> do<00:00:53.390> feel

you find at this level because I'm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.630 
you find at this level because I'm
reading<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.770> running<00:01:13.040> back<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.250> life<00:01:13.369> hundred

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
reading it running back to life hundred

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.120 
reading it running back to life hundred
cups<00:01:14.080> there<00:01:15.080> are<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.259> lot<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.470> noobs<00:01:15.770> if<00:01:16.009> you

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
cups there are a lot of noobs if you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.719 
cups there are a lot of noobs if you
link<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.520> oh<00:01:16.700> here<00:01:16.940> we<00:01:16.970> go<00:01:17.119> says<00:01:17.619> 87,000<00:01:18.619> gold<00:01:18.800> I

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.680 

think<00:01:22.729> we're<00:01:22.820> going<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.030> do<00:01:23.149> this<00:01:23.300> one<00:01:23.539> right

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
think we're going to do this one right

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.790 
think we're going to do this one right
okay<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.420> i'm<00:01:26.420> guessing<00:01:26.990> really<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.649> best

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
okay so i'm guessing really the best

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.200 
okay so i'm guessing really the best
thing<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.009> do<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.369> just<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.670> throw<00:01:28.820> down<00:01:29.030> some

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
thing to do is just to throw down some

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.969 
thing to do is just to throw down some
wall<00:01:29.390> breakers<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:29.929> is<00:01:30.409> interesting<00:01:30.890> you've

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
wall breakers this is interesting you've

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.100 
wall breakers this is interesting you've
got<00:01:31.130> lots<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.429> little<00:01:31.580> dots<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:32.030> walls<00:01:32.300> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
got lots of little dots of walls the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.870 
got lots of little dots of walls the
wall<00:01:33.289> breakers<00:01:33.649> should<00:01:33.950> not<00:01:34.159> be<00:01:34.280> attracted<00:01:34.490> to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
wall breakers should not be attracted to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.090 
wall breakers should not be attracted to
those<00:01:35.030> there<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.110> go<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.740> gangster<00:01:37.039> a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
those there you go so the gangster a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.350 
those there you go so the gangster a
trick<00:01:37.539> okay<00:01:38.539> that's<00:01:38.720> drawing<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:40.360> drawing

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
trick okay that's drawing out drawing

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
trick okay that's drawing out drawing
out<00:01:41.509> as<00:01:41.630> fancast<00:01:42.080> a<00:01:42.170> little<00:01:42.409> bit<00:01:43.539> so<00:01:44.539> what<00:01:44.840> I'm

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
out as fancast a little bit so what I'm

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.960 
out as fancast a little bit so what I'm
not<00:01:45.530> really<00:01:45.649> sure<00:01:45.770> what<00:01:46.069> to<00:01:46.190> do<00:01:46.340> here<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.819> why

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
not really sure what to do here so why

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.430 
not really sure what to do here so why
don't<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.119> just<00:01:47.270> go

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.190 

well<00:01:55.100> as<00:01:55.490> I've<00:01:55.730> only<00:01:55.880> got<00:01:56.060> about<00:01:56.420> half<00:01:56.870> as<00:01:57.080> many

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
well as I've only got about half as many

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.950 
well as I've only got about half as many
wall<00:01:57.470> breakers<00:01:57.890> as<00:01:58.070> he's<00:01:58.280> got<00:01:58.460> walls<00:01:58.700> I'm<00:01:59.690> just

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
wall breakers as he's got walls I'm just

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.690 
wall breakers as he's got walls I'm just
thinking<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:01.190> that's<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:01.670> bombarding<00:02:03.700> on

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
thinking that that's just bombarding on

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:19.340 
thinking that that's just bombarding on
one<00:02:04.850> side

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.810
