00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

all<00:00:00.780> right<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.050> sure<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.410> guys<00:00:01.620> are<00:00:01.650> all

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
all right I'm sure you guys are all

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.999 
all right I'm sure you guys are all
wondering<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.820> I<00:00:03.210> stopped<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.140> v-cube<00:00:04.560> 6<00:00:04.859> to

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
wondering how I stopped this v-cube 6 to

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.249 
wondering how I stopped this v-cube 6 to
explode<00:00:05.549> when<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:05.879> was<00:00:06.180> apparently<00:00:06.480> solving<00:00:07.140> it

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
explode when I was apparently solving it

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.730 
explode when I was apparently solving it
incredibly<00:00:07.919> fast<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:09.210> but<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.630> figure<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.050> also

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
incredibly fast so but I figure I also

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.499 
incredibly fast so but I figure I also
gave<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.099> guys<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.429> different<00:00:12.120> camera

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
gave you guys this different camera

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
gave you guys this different camera
angle<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.110> am<00:00:13.200> recording<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.040> waterproof

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
angle I am recording with a waterproof

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.430 
angle I am recording with a waterproof
camera<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.480> record<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:16.020> 60<00:00:16.320> frames

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
camera and it can record at 60 frames

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.340 
camera and it can record at 60 frames
per<00:00:16.650> second<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.609> lower<00:00:17.760> HD<00:00:18.390> setting<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
per second at the lower HD setting so I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.810 
per second at the lower HD setting so I
figured<00:00:19.710> it'd<00:00:19.830> also<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.340> need<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.699> get

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
figured it'd also be kind of need to get

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
figured it'd also be kind of need to get
some<00:00:21.090> cruel<00:00:21.630> slow<00:00:21.960> motion<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.769> well

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
some cruel slow motion with it as well

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.620 
some cruel slow motion with it as well
all<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.769> recording<00:00:25.849> and<00:00:26.849> let's<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.510> if

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
all right so recording and let's see if

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.740 
all right so recording and let's see if
I<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> get<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.380> explode<00:00:29.150> now<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.599> was

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
I can get this to explode now as I was

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.780 
I can get this to explode now as I was
solving<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.230> puzzle<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.250> trying<00:00:32.640> out

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
solving the puzzle here I was trying out

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.639 
solving the puzzle here I was trying out
a<00:00:32.850> technique<00:00:33.450> where<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.020> still<00:00:34.230> turn<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a technique where I still turn the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.069 
a technique where I still turn the
layers<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.190> same<00:00:35.489> speed<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.510> moved<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
layers the same speed but I moved the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
layers the same speed but I moved the
cube<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.829> slowly<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.270> hoping

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
cube but more slowly and I was hoping

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
cube but more slowly and I was hoping
that<00:00:39.750> after<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.110> sped<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:40.980> look

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
that after I sped it up it would look

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
that after I sped it up it would look
like<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.940> still<00:00:42.090> handling<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
like you know I was still handling the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840 
like you know I was still handling the
cube<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> same<00:00:43.559> way<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.219> turning<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> layers

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
cube the same way but turning the layers

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
cube the same way but turning the layers
incredibly<00:00:45.450> fast<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.680> didn't<00:00:47.010> quite<00:00:47.160> give

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
incredibly fast but it didn't quite give

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.299 
incredibly fast but it didn't quite give
me<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> result<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.450> wanted<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.440> yeah<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> tried

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
me the result I wanted but yeah I tried

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340 
me the result I wanted but yeah I tried
now<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> camera<00:00:51.420> shake<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.899> used<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
now for the camera shake I used the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100 
now for the camera shake I used the
wiggle<00:00:52.770> effect<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.550> Adobe<00:00:53.760> After<00:00:54.210> Effects<00:00:54.809> I'm

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
wiggle effect in Adobe After Effects I'm

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450 
wiggle effect in Adobe After Effects I'm
sure<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> could<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> many<00:00:56.190> other

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
sure you could do this in many other

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
sure you could do this in many other
editing<00:00:57.000> software's<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> wasn't<00:00:58.350> able<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
editing software's but I wasn't able to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.540 
editing software's but I wasn't able to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.380 

all<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:07.980> so<00:01:08.190> how<00:01:08.400> did<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.910> that<00:01:09.060> shot

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
all right so how did I get that shot

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.670 
all right so how did I get that shot
look<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.290> here

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
look right here

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000 
look right here
there<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.420> little<00:01:12.420> pieces<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.140> yarn<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
there are little pieces of yarn that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
there are little pieces of yarn that
hold<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.520> two<00:01:14.760> pieces<00:01:15.120> together<00:01:15.300> here's<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
hold these two pieces together here's a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
hold these two pieces together here's a
closer<00:01:16.440> up<00:01:16.710> main<00:01:17.670> camera

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
closer up main camera

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.080 
closer up main camera
see<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.890> happened<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.850> yarn

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
see so what happened here is the yarn

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.180 
see so what happened here is the yarn
eventually<00:01:21.690> untwisted<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> Hume<00:01:22.979> fell

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
eventually untwisted and the Hume fell

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.100 
eventually untwisted and the Hume fell
apart<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.940> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.720> core<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
apart and as you can see my core is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.930 
apart and as you can see my core is
adjustable<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.860> thought<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
adjustable I thought about just

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.240 
adjustable I thought about just
modifying<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.050> core<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.860> screws

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
modifying the core so that the screws

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
modifying the core so that the screws
would<00:01:29.520> unloosen<00:01:30.240> themselves<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.830> know<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
would unloosen themselves but you know I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
would unloosen themselves but you know I
didn't<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.910> cube<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> fall

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
didn't really want the cube to fall

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.390 
didn't really want the cube to fall
apart<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.110> didn't<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.340> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
apart when I didn't want it to so I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
apart when I didn't want it to so I
decided<00:01:35.760> yarn<00:01:36.119> would<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.510> better<00:01:36.720> option

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
decided yarn would be a better option

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
decided yarn would be a better option
now<00:01:37.800> assembling<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> cube<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.940> yarn<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
now assembling the cube with yarn and it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.020 
now assembling the cube with yarn and it
was<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> big<00:01:40.140> challenge<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.979> first<00:01:41.460> twisted<00:01:41.940> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
was a big challenge I first twisted the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.120 
was a big challenge I first twisted the
yarn<00:01:42.300> to<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> good<00:01:42.810> tension<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.440> then<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.830> put

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
yarn to a good tension and then I put

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
yarn to a good tension and then I put
all<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.550> pieces<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.149> these<00:01:45.330> quarters<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
all the pieces on these quarters here so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
all the pieces on these quarters here so
that<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.860> sit<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.520> place<00:01:47.700> once<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that they would all sit in place once I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
that they would all sit in place once I
got<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> last<00:01:49.080> piece<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:49.860> everything

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
got the last piece in then everything

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.150 
got the last piece in then everything
fit<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.789> snugly<00:01:51.300> here<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.990> used<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> bed<00:01:52.590> piece<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
fit in snugly here I used a bed piece of

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.490 
fit in snugly here I used a bed piece of
a<00:01:53.250> paper<00:01:53.490> clip<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.000> hold<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.300> yarn<00:01:54.570> since<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a paper clip to hold the yarn since the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.650 
a paper clip to hold the yarn since the
paper<00:01:55.680> clips<00:01:56.070> took<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.640> space<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.270> wasn't

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
paper clips took so much space I wasn't

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.810 
paper clips took so much space I wasn't
able<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> use<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.410> original<00:01:58.649> center<00:01:59.100> caps<00:01:59.340> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
able to use the original center caps so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.969 
able to use the original center caps so
instead<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.270> cut<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> flat<00:02:00.960> piece<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.289> plastic

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
instead I cut a flat piece of plastic

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.490 
instead I cut a flat piece of plastic
from<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> Lego<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.910> glued<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:04.140> seemed

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
from a Lego and glued it on it seemed

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.710 
from a Lego and glued it on it seemed
out<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> place<00:02:04.830> here<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.640> after<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> tile

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
out of place here but after I put a tile

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.169 
out of place here but after I put a tile
on<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.320> was<00:02:07.410> hardly<00:02:07.740> noticeable<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.640> got<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
on it it was hardly noticeable I got the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.780 
on it it was hardly noticeable I got the
tile<00:02:09.479> from<00:02:09.810> some<00:02:10.080> uncut<00:02:10.649> tile<00:02:10.979> material<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.610> got

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
tile from some uncut tile material I got

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.680 
tile from some uncut tile material I got
from<00:02:11.970> cube<00:02:12.239> Smith

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
from cube Smith

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.449 
from cube Smith
now<00:02:12.930> staging<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.530> whole<00:02:13.769> thing<00:02:13.980> wasn't

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
now staging this whole thing wasn't

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.430 
now staging this whole thing wasn't
flawless<00:02:14.730> once<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> cube<00:02:15.959> assembled<00:02:16.380> I

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
flawless once I got the cube assembled I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.410 
flawless once I got the cube assembled I
started<00:02:16.830> testing<00:02:17.250> out<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.519> turnin<00:02:17.880> after

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
started testing out the turnin after

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.660 
started testing out the turnin after
solving<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.230> while<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.650> felt<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.040> snap<00:02:20.400> in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
solving it for a while I felt a snap in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330 
solving it for a while I felt a snap in
the<00:02:20.790> cube<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.600> suddenly<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> chunk<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.890> pieces

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the cube then suddenly a chunk of pieces

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
the cube then suddenly a chunk of pieces
fell<00:02:23.580> off<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.239> soon<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.959> whole<00:02:25.170> cube

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
fell off here and soon the whole cube

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.340 
fell off here and soon the whole cube
fell<00:02:26.040> apart<00:02:26.459> once<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.360> got<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.630> reassembled<00:02:27.989> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
fell apart once I got it reassembled I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.050 
fell apart once I got it reassembled I
went<00:02:28.560> right<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.100> camera<00:02:29.310> without<00:02:29.760> hardly

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
went right to the camera without hardly

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.390 
went right to the camera without hardly
testing<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.290> first<00:02:31.530> time<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.830> tried<00:02:32.040> hoping

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
testing it the first time I tried hoping

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.310 
testing it the first time I tried hoping
it<00:02:32.489> for<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.700> camera<00:02:33.120> nothing<00:02:33.420> happened<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.110> got

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
it for the camera nothing happened I got

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.470 
it for the camera nothing happened I got
through<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> whole<00:02:34.950> solve<00:02:35.370> uneventful<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
through a whole solve uneventful and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.860 
through a whole solve uneventful and
it's<00:02:36.870> solved<00:02:37.350> fail<00:02:38.280> I'm<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> second<00:02:39.450> solve<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it's solved fail I'm a second solve I

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
it's solved fail I'm a second solve I
was<00:02:40.049> nearly<00:02:40.290> done<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.920> second<00:02:41.340> center

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
was nearly done with the second center

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.410 
was nearly done with the second center
when<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.180> cube<00:02:42.570> finally<00:02:43.350> fell<00:02:43.650> apart

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.310 

Oh

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.330 

[Music]

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.100

[Laughter]

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.670 

so<00:03:16.060> now<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.270> know<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> video<00:03:16.930> was<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> lot<00:03:17.440> more

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
so now you know the video was a lot more

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.740 
so now you know the video was a lot more
complicated<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.520> make<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.090> looked<00:03:19.360> did

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
complicated to make it and it looked did

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.330 
complicated to make it and it looked did
you<00:03:19.900> guys<00:03:20.020> find<00:03:20.349> this<00:03:20.470> behind-the-scenes
