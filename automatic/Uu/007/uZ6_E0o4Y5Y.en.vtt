00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
it's a really good competition but it's

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.880 
it's a really good competition but it's

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890

been very good for us so far in my short

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
time here I commentators are very

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.960 
time here I commentators are very
inexperienced<00:00:07.529> managed<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.519> Champions

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
inexperienced managed on the Champions

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.620 
inexperienced managed on the Champions
League<00:00:09.030> but<00:00:09.889> no<00:00:10.889> we've<00:00:11.400> done<00:00:11.610> wealth<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.179> no

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
League but no we've done wealth and no

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.060 
League but no we've done wealth and no
will<00:00:12.809> get<00:00:12.929> out<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.290> ultimate<00:00:13.650> test<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
will get out the ultimate test and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.640 
will get out the ultimate test and
Bayern<00:00:14.280> Munich<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.730> think<00:00:15.420> they'd<00:00:15.570> say<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
Bayern Munich I think they'd say the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
Bayern Munich I think they'd say the
pressure<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.100> equally<00:00:17.460> balanced<00:00:18.029> because<00:00:18.150> we

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
pressure is equally balanced because we

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.820 
pressure is equally balanced because we
want<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> win<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> game<00:00:19.109> as<00:00:19.230> much<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.410> Bayern

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
want you win the game as much as Bayern

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.550 
want you win the game as much as Bayern
Munich<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.730> go<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.449> game<00:00:21.600> nor

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
Munich do we go into the game nor

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.009 
Munich do we go into the game nor

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
can tell by the training that attitude

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.880 
can tell by the training that attitude
of<00:00:41.399> seeing<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> big<00:00:42.780> game<00:00:42.890> I'm

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
of seeing like this is a big game I'm

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.319 
of seeing like this is a big game I'm
the<00:00:44.070> old<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.399> ear<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.820> want<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the old one ear you want to put in the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
the old one ear you want to put in the
big<00:00:45.480> games<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.620> over<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
big games that's with I think over the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.580 
big games that's with I think over the
years<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.280> course<00:00:47.550> you'd<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.700> wanted<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> do

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
years of course you'd have wanted to do

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.660 
years of course you'd have wanted to do
so<00:00:49.590> obviously<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> players<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.280> different

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
so obviously the players are different

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.319 
so obviously the players are different
of<00:00:51.600> both<00:00:51.870> sides<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.190> tradition<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of both sides but the tradition and the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.020 
of both sides but the tradition and the
clubs<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.050> still<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> same<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:56.250> huge<00:00:56.730> clubs

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
clubs are still the same two huge clubs

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
clubs are still the same two huge clubs
and<00:00:57.559> two<00:00:58.559> great<00:00:58.890> histories<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.870> two<00:01:00.870> football

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and two great histories and two football

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
and two great histories and two football
teams<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:02.100> play<00:01:02.609> football<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> correct<00:01:03.480> way

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
teams that play football the correct way

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.070

it's a two-legged game and we have to

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.860 
it's a two-legged game and we have to
make<00:02:51.430> sure<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.270> two<00:02:52.450> legs<00:02:52.660> are

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.640 
mentioned it many times i think diving
is<00:04:01.000> one<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.360> hardest<00:04:02.110> things<00:04:02.560> for

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
is one of the hardest things for

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.830 
is one of the hardest things for

retrospective diving their cameras are

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.600 
retrospective diving their cameras are
safety<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.620> pick<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.920> out<00:04:09.069> think<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.519> would

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
safety to pick that out think it would

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.400 
safety to pick that out think it would
help<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.910> referees<00:04:10.239> that's<00:04:11.140> more<00:04:11.350> in

help the referees that's more in
personal<00:04:11.860> view<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:13.030> know<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.180> wouldn't<00:04:13.390> want

to comment and on in on any individual
player<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.090> think<00:04:16.329> it's<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.510> hard<00:04:16.720> job<00:04:16.780> for<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
player I think it's a hard job for the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.620 
player I think it's a hard job for the
referees<00:04:17.729> which<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:18.940> think<00:04:19.269> they<00:04:19.389> could<00:04:19.540> do

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
referees which I think they could do

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.879 
referees which I think they could do
with<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> little<00:04:19.930> bit<00:04:20.169> help<00:04:20.380> when<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.590> comes<00:04:20.620> to

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
with a little bit help when it comes to

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.370 
with a little bit help when it comes to
that<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.450> don't<00:04:22.450> know<00:04:22.570> where<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.990> where<00:04:23.350> you

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
that I don't know where you where you

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.800 
that I don't know where you where you
have<00:04:23.650> your<00:04:23.680> information<00:04:24.400> from<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.479> think

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810
