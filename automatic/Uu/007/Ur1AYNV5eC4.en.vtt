00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.000 
of the voices don't fit the characters
mouth<00:03:28.760> movements<00:03:29.419> but<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:30.560> really<00:03:30.709> doesn't

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
mouth movements but that really doesn't

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.099 
mouth movements but that really doesn't
matter<00:03:31.129> to<00:03:31.280> me<00:03:31.549> because<00:03:31.750> they're<00:03:32.750> kind<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.019> I

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
matter to me because they're kind of I

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.080 
matter to me because they're kind of I
think<00:03:33.169> they're<00:03:33.470> kind<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.709> importing<00:03:34.459> voices

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
think they're kind of importing voices

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.300 
think they're kind of importing voices
and<00:03:35.419> plus<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.199> know<00:03:36.319> our<00:03:36.440> trailers<00:03:36.859> they<00:03:37.069> arm

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
and plus you know our trailers they arm

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.220 
and plus you know our trailers they arm
they<00:03:37.879> add<00:03:38.060> voice<00:03:38.359> no<00:03:38.599> since<00:03:38.930> they're<00:03:39.199> not

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
they add voice no since they're not

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.589 
they add voice no since they're not
really<00:03:39.560> talking<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.280> make<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.549> cool<00:03:41.030> or

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
really talking in to make it cool or

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.449 
really talking in to make it cool or
whatever<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.769> think<00:03:43.040> that's<00:03:43.220> what<00:03:43.310> they're

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
whatever so I think that's what they're

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.830 
whatever so I think that's what they're
doing<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:43.909> doesn't<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:44.480> doesn't<00:03:44.750> matter

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
doing so doesn't really doesn't matter

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.409 
doing so doesn't really doesn't matter
to<00:03:44.989> me<00:03:45.109> but<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.739> hope<00:03:45.949> that<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.340> um<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:47.269> actual

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
to me but I hope that the um the actual

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.530 
to me but I hope that the um the actual
