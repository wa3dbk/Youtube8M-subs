00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.409
 the defender stood 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.409

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.039
 some sources 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:20.039

 because they have given 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.729

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.019
 audience wants the audience with lepe 200 plenty of politics
