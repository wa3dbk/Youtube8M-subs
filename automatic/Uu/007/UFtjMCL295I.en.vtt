00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
we start of this system I guess I can

00:00:41.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
we start of this system I guess I can
change<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.739> layout<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.100> it<00:00:42.430> later

and I need a filter here as well right
should<00:01:44.710> work<00:01:44.890> with<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.100> filter<00:01:45.609> I<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:54.520> want

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
should work with a filter I don't want

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:11.310 
should work with a filter I don't want

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.940 

stop<00:02:12.320> correct<00:02:15.459> guess<00:02:16.459> we<00:02:16.670> will<00:02:16.760> never<00:02:16.820> know

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
stop correct guess we will never know

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:30.190 
stop correct guess we will never know

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.940 

well<00:04:04.940> let's<00:04:05.270> fix<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.569> later<00:04:05.900> actually

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.640

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:27.210 

let's<00:04:18.100> see<00:04:18.280> if<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.459> works

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.430 

doesn't<00:04:27.940> need<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.120> go<00:04:28.270> inside<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.990> top<00:04:29.290> right

needs<00:04:41.009> knows<00:04:41.909> what<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.360> needs<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.749> call

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:55.279 

we'll<00:04:46.400> see

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:10.950 

connected<00:04:57.259> strong<00:04:58.259> power

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.030 

do<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:29.960> matter

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
do you matter

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.950 
do you matter
it's<00:05:32.760> putting<00:05:33.030> everyone<00:05:33.480> in<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.750> first<00:05:34.080> spot

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
it's putting everyone in the first spot

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.850 
it's putting everyone in the first spot
okay<00:05:36.960> maybe<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.470> need<00:05:37.560> redstone<00:05:38.160> here<00:05:39.740> that's<00:05:40.740> a

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
okay maybe I need redstone here that's a

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.150 
okay maybe I need redstone here that's a
fail

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.040 

or<00:05:47.760> maybe<00:05:47.940> not

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
or maybe not

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.970 
or maybe not
whatever

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
whatever

00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:07.760 
whatever
she'll<00:05:52.700> circle<00:05:53.450> through<00:05:53.690> every<00:05:54.160> all<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.400> them

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:27.310 

and<00:06:08.770> I<00:06:08.860> need<00:06:09.040> more<00:06:09.220> solar<00:06:09.550> cells

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.350 

this<00:06:28.320> is<00:06:28.470> expensive<00:06:29.010> way<00:06:29.370> to<00:06:29.400> make<00:06:29.700> diamonds<00:06:29.940> I

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
this is expensive way to make diamonds I

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.340 
this is expensive way to make diamonds I
don't<00:06:30.720> know<00:06:30.780> if<00:06:30.900> this<00:06:31.050> is<00:06:31.080> efficient<00:06:31.680> at<00:06:31.770> all

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
don't know if this is efficient at all

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.340 
don't know if this is efficient at all
transmuting<00:06:34.350> would<00:06:34.650> be<00:06:34.770> even<00:06:35.040> faster<00:06:36.350> just

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
transmuting would be even faster just

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
transmuting would be even faster just
straight<00:06:37.710> transmuting<00:06:39.770> maybe<00:06:40.770> I<00:06:40.919> can<00:06:41.070> do<00:06:41.190> that

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
straight transmuting maybe I can do that

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.950 
straight transmuting maybe I can do that
for<00:06:41.820> I<00:06:44.450> try<00:06:45.450> to<00:06:45.480> make<00:06:45.930> scrap<00:06:46.620> boxes<00:06:47.040> down<00:06:47.250> here

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.220 
for I try to make scrap boxes down here
how<00:06:48.960> did<00:06:49.200> you<00:06:49.320> get<00:06:49.500> inside<00:06:49.740> my<00:06:50.100> house

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
how did you get inside my house

00:06:51.230 --> 00:07:06.230 
how did you get inside my house
seriously<00:06:52.230> not<00:06:56.419> not<00:06:57.419> okay

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:14.890 

you

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:32.700 

it's<00:07:15.440> too<00:07:15.800> much<00:07:16.400> moving<00:07:16.790> around
