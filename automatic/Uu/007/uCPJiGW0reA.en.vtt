00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.879
 and that's it 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
 dear ones and my cellphone what is the 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.000
 difference between a physical change and a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 chemical change lion 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 a physical change occurs when the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.520
 matter changes size state or shape 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.279
 when that watermelon fell it happened to be 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.120
 a green and round watermelon to be a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.490
 mix of red and green pieces 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.720
 it's still a watermelon but 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.060
 She turned 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.820
 and another type of physical change is the 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.280
 changing a state of matter to another 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.650
 the ice cream that is in this thing was 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 solid a minute ago but it's 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.310
 transforming into liquid faster than 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.770
 what I can eat it 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.440
 melted ice cream is a physical change 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.570
 fast but some physical changes 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 it can take years and years to occur 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.630
 eight years ago this patio was new but 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.020
 With the passage of time , some 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.060
 small cracks then water fell 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 froze and expanded within the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.910
 cracks this caused them to increase from 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.940
 size this type of change is called 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 physical wear and is caused by 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.830
 effects of water and wind throughout 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.380
 of time 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.270
 much of the appearance of the surface 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.270
 terrestrial is due to physical wear 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.860
 and that stroller was left by my cousin danny 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.080
 when the rusty metal came to visit 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.270
 it's an example of chemical change 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.060
 the metal iron reacts with the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.880
 oxygen from the air and forms a third 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.659
 substance that we call oxide or 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.759
 rust 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.649
 and you know that a chemical change has 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.170
 occurred when the substances that 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.380
 make up an object have been transformed 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.899
 in other substances 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.390
 when the sodium and chlorine atoms 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.520
 they come into contact a link is made 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.190
 chemical and the result is salt 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.340
 I do not think you want to eat sodium or chlorine 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.250
 by themselves they are both very poisonous 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.740
 but the salt crystals produced by 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.240
 this chemical reaction are found in 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.240
 all kitchens 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.800
 it's mobile so you can not always see 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.320
 the chemical reactions 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.810
 in fact every day they occur 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.970
 chemical reactions inside you 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.980
 when the food enters your body your 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.519
 teeth grind it 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.530
 that is a physical change , by the way 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.450
 chemical changes occur when 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.000
 food are decomposed by the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.629
 enzymes so that nutrients can 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.980
 reach the cells that need them 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.830
 you know that a chemical change has occurred 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.380
 because your energy level goes up more or 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.100
 less an hour after eating 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.450
 santander 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.709
 sorry I think it's making me hungry 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.709
 no thanks 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.980
 No I do not actually think I was wrong not 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 I'm not hungry
