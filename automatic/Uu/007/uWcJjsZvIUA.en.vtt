the points of the machining for this
foots<00:01:17.560> it's<00:01:18.159> quite<00:01:18.430> simple<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.820> machine<00:01:19.150> for

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
foots it's quite simple the machine for

foots it's quite simple the machine for
you're<00:01:19.479> gonna<00:01:19.600> drill<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.049> hole<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.460> door

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
you're gonna drill a hole in the door

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.719 
you're gonna drill a hole in the door
for<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> body<00:01:26.010> square<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.159> corners<00:01:27.580> out

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
for the body square the corners out

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.430 
for the body square the corners out
however<00:01:28.240> you're<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.600> end<00:01:28.720> up<00:01:28.840> doing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
however you're going to end up doing

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.050 
however you're going to end up doing
that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:32.110> know<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.470> would<00:01:33.460> probably<00:01:33.640> drill<00:01:34.030> a

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
that you know I would probably drill a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.609 
that you know I would probably drill a
hole<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.330> then<00:01:34.540> square<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.990> corners<00:01:35.350> out<00:01:35.440> to

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
hole and then square the corners out to

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.469 
hole and then square the corners out to
get<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.830> entire<00:01:36.040> body<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.580> then<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.240> would

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
get the entire body and then I would

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.090 
get the entire body and then I would
come<00:01:37.659> in<00:01:37.869> come<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:40.740> two<00:01:41.740> preparations

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
come in come in with two preparations

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.600 
come in come in with two preparations
actually<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:44.200> for<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.530> backing<00:01:44.920> plate<00:01:45.189> here

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
actually one for the backing plate here

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually one for the backing plate here
and<00:01:45.790> then<00:01:46.030> another<00:01:46.150> one<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.479> just<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.930> face

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
and then another one for just the face

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.550 
and then another one for just the face
plate<00:01:48.479> although<00:01:49.479> that's<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.780> lot<00:01:49.930> of<00:01:49.960> work<00:01:50.260> I

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
plate although that's a lot of work I

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.170 
plate although that's a lot of work I
don't<00:01:51.130> think<00:01:51.250> most<00:01:51.520> people<00:01:51.820> are<00:01:51.909> going<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.060> go

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
don't think most people are going to go

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.969 
don't think most people are going to go
through<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.510> much<00:01:52.720> effort<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.350> to

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
through that much effort to do that to

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.120 
through that much effort to do that to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
step that like it would be required by
