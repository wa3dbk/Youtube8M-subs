a<00:00:37.010> scorer<00:00:37.399> outside<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.149> picture<00:00:38.450> I'm<00:00:38.780> not

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
surprised and I don't think that it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.580 
surprised and I don't think that it's
the<00:00:41.239> missing<00:00:41.719> piece<00:00:41.989> that<00:00:42.020> has<00:00:42.260> anything<00:00:42.469> to

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
do with it I think it's a matter of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.940 
do with it I think it's a matter of
fatigue<00:00:43.910> traveling<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.480> west<00:00:44.829> coming<00:00:45.829> off

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.969 
think that that surprisingly are not
surprising<00:01:29.900> me<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.170> factor<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.829> why<00:01:30.920> the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
surprising me is a factor and why the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.819 
surprising me is a factor and why the
defensive<00:01:31.579> numbers<00:01:31.729> have<00:01:32.420> gone<00:01:32.659> down

defensive numbers have gone down

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.859 
defensive numbers have gone down
dramatically<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.340> is<00:01:34.610> absence<00:01:35.299> yeah<00:01:35.659> I

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
dramatically and it is absence yeah I

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.060 
dramatically and it is absence yeah I
would<00:01:36.200> definitely<00:01:36.320> agree<00:01:36.590> with<00:01:36.829> that<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:36.979> think

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
would definitely agree with that I think

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.640
