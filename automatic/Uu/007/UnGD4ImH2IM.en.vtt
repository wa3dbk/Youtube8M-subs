when they cast spells like I mentioned

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
when they cast spells like I mentioned
before<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:21.030> also<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> area<00:01:22.619> where

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
before it also it's also the area where

before it also it's also the area where
skills<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.400> empathy<00:01:23.580> where<00:01:24.270> every<00:01:24.570> time

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
skills like empathy where every time

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
skills like empathy where every time
like<00:01:25.170> warriors<00:01:25.590> assassins<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> dervishes

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like warriors assassins and dervishes

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.109 
like warriors assassins and dervishes
like<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.390> every<00:01:28.080> time<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.439> try<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> attack

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
like that every time they try to attack

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.850 
like that every time they try to attack
or<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> hit

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
or the hit

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.510 
or the hit
they<00:01:31.430> actually<00:01:31.670> take<00:01:32.060> damage<00:01:32.270> for<00:01:32.660> doing<00:01:32.930> that

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
they actually take damage for doing that

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.440 
they actually take damage for doing that
so<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.760> domination<00:01:35.210> area<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.930> their<00:01:36.200> primary

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450
