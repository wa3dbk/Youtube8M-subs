00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.940
 the ifa 2012 and my impression becomes too 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 Now we are on the stand of 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 day 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.390
 and first of all right away no 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 i was not for on the ifa me 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.950
 was alone there but I have to say that 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.730
 all of dell has me at my best 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.770
 like 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.840
 the whole thing reminds a bit 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.250
 Minecraft you see this pixelated 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.440
 they do that a bit 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.400
 but of course I want to remember 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.260
 you do not copy 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.730
 that's why you just have the skyline of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.470
 Berlin, for example, in the background 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 you can see it looks a bit like that 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.610
 the skyscrapers the Warsaw bridge 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.699
 the brandenburger tor reichstag everything 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.410
 it's all a bit pixelated and 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.510
 there is again a big social media 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.730
 For example, there is a corner 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.379
 always Thomas Tomasz is exactly 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.960
 you see him there now and these topics 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.670
 The checkered shirt because seen again 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.670
 Rewind should really know 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.500
 here on youtube 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.810
 so again the butterflies were the goods 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.180
 Illuminated with the best illuminated 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.560
 and the hall has a club 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.630
 unique design and if there is one 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.810
 Price would then apply for 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.369
 they definitely deserve this 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.299
 there was still the gamer corner 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.580
 development so far it looks so design 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.510
 Alienware I am still working on it 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.830
 once sent one of these pcs times 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.540
 just get up to 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.460
 make to see how the processing 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.740
 is exactly what components 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.140
 are installed which drivers installed 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.340
 are saying, whether the Alienware pc 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.020
 engaging his money is worth 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.689
 but that may take a while 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.140
 There are other things monitors here 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.759
 smaller plc it you see it here there 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.530
 and there was the possibility of a few 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.170
 to play games as myself 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.479
 impressed 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.820
 about the performance of the calculator 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 the possibility always exists 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 until Wednesday of the trade 13 model 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.630
 his stand then it went then 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.680
 Unfortunately, sap sa did not continue 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.899
 to come up with so much 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.360
 your design is still the same 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.030
 like on the cebit and how often last 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.510
 ifa there is a white stand with whole 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.880
 a lot of green elements and individual 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.530
 Exhibits of your pcs notebooks 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.500
 and so on 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.780
 really ideas are not behind it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.180
 in my opinion you still see behind 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.780
 a few degrees world city and some pcs 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.180
 were presented extremely as to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.830
 example now a single gamer pc there 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.239
 You could then his opinion too 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.380
 picture if you wanted and could and so on 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.569
 other hardware manufacturers were too 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.310
 but not really so 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.590
 Cherry is known for his example 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.239
 Keyboards was on a stand with 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 many other manufacturers together 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.989
 I had the feeling, though 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.459
 that the ladies and gentlemen of the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.530
 press department more with itself 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.040
 were busy than with the press 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.720
 pity so brother known for his 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.250
 printer he has a very big stand 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.500
 I'm a little bit over it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.209
 strolled've considered should I 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.920
 with info for you or not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.870
 printers are still up to now 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.850
 never been asked by you therefore 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.130
 I'm just interested to ask 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.260
 you also printer topics or should I 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.799
 but rather with normal hardware 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.470
 stay 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.100
 the comment field you know just 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.100
 enroll 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.970
 and how it looks can do last but 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.859
 Not least, there is a blockhouse toller 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.390
 name of intel 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.760
 I have a little bit in here 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.410
 image captured that there is still 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.180

 a bit blocks do that yes we do more 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.780
 or less all I guess one 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.730
 a bit behind the hall 23 years 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.709
