00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.410 
it's upside-down almost and I have a
little<00:02:03.560> bit<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:03.860> magic<00:02:04.640> formula<00:02:05.150> this<00:02:05.240> is

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
little bit of magic formula this is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.620 
little bit of magic formula this is
textured<00:02:05.990> that's<00:02:06.310> why<00:02:07.310> he's<00:02:08.210> got<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.420> head

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
textured that's why he's got a head

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.850 
textured that's why he's got a head
upside<00:02:08.990> down<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.460> a<00:02:10.490> very<00:02:10.700> subtle<00:02:11.090> powder

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
upside down this is a very subtle powder

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
upside down this is a very subtle powder
but<00:02:12.860> just<00:02:13.160> gives<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.090> hair<00:02:14.300> some<00:02:14.570> natural

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
but just gives the hair some natural

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.960 
but just gives the hair some natural
texture<00:02:15.500> without<00:02:15.770> having<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.190> sticky<00:02:16.490> product

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
texture without having a sticky product

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.720 
texture without having a sticky product
in<00:02:17.150> there<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.350> then<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.709> can<00:02:18.770> get<00:02:19.130> Tony<00:02:19.580> to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
in there and then if I can get Tony to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.820 
in there and then if I can get Tony to
throw<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> hair<00:02:20.209> back<00:02:20.450> again<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.320> use<00:02:21.590> these
