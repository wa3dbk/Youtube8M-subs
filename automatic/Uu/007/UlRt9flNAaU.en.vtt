of<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.750> bummer<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.220> when<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.580> such<00:03:02.880> an

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
of a bummer that when they have such an

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.520 
of a bummer that when they have such an
array<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.269> characters<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.080> game<00:03:04.110> and

standard<00:03:08.160> carts<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.730> couple<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.750> variations

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
standard carts a couple of variations

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.810

like<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.590> hot<00:03:10.709> rod<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.040> wild<00:03:11.370> wing<00:03:11.519> but

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
like the hot rod in the wild wing but

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.240 
like the hot rod in the wild wing but
those<00:03:11.970> are<00:03:12.120> duplicated<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.950> wild<00:03:13.950> wing<00:03:14.100> is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
