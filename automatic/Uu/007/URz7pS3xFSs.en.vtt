00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
let's see the jump how about it so I

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.699 
let's see the jump how about it so I

yeah<00:03:17.950> pretty<00:03:18.280> powerful<00:03:18.640> machine<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:20.280> what<00:03:21.280> I'm

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
yeah pretty powerful machine so what I'm

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.160 
yeah pretty powerful machine so what I'm
going<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> do<00:03:21.820> now<00:03:22.000> I'm<00:03:22.630> going<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.900> fly<00:03:23.110> it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
going to do now I'm going to fly it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.050 
going to do now I'm going to fly it
around<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> cruise<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.310> GPS<00:03:24.670> position

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
around in the cruise and GPS position

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.240 
around in the cruise and GPS position
hold<00:03:25.270> mode<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.810> see<00:03:26.650> how<00:03:26.860> long<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.220> can

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
hold mode and see how long I can

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:37.229 
hold mode and see how long I can
actually<00:03:27.760> fly<00:03:27.970> it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.589 

okay<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.170> baby<00:03:39.349> is<00:03:39.620> still<00:03:39.860> flying<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:41.420> has

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
I'm flying on a GPS position hold mode

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.980 
I'm flying on a GPS position hold mode
that<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.510> simulate<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:40.690> aerial<00:04:41.690> filming

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
that is to simulate the aerial filming

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.560 
that is to simulate the aerial filming
that<00:04:42.470> people<00:04:43.039> fly<00:04:43.340> with<00:04:43.610> aerial<00:04:43.910> filming<00:04:44.120> slow

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
that people fly with aerial filming slow

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.820 
that people fly with aerial filming slow
and<00:04:44.750> nice<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.770> time<00:04:46.010> by<00:04:46.190> time<00:04:46.370> I'm<00:04:46.610> flying<00:04:46.880> slow

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
and nice so time by time I'm flying slow

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.620 
and nice so time by time I'm flying slow
but<00:04:48.830> time<00:04:49.130> but<00:04:49.160> time<00:04:49.400> I'm<00:04:49.789> giving<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.300> full

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
but time but time I'm giving it full

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.529 
but time but time I'm giving it full

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.939 
cyclic on the forward to actually
simulate<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.770> mixed<00:04:55.699> flight<00:04:56.419> style<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.229> now

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
simulate a mixed flight style and now

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:18.150 
simulate a mixed flight style and now
the<00:04:58.010> battery<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.550> beeping<00:04:59.740> so<00:05:00.740> we<00:05:00.889> lend

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.510 

all<00:05:19.160> right<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:21.800> are<00:05:21.830> at<00:05:23.350> 20<00:05:24.350> minutes<00:05:24.710> 16

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
all right we are at 20 minutes 16

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.350 
all right we are at 20 minutes 16
seconds<00:05:26.060> with<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.990> killer<00:05:27.350> set<00:05:27.620> up<00:05:27.800> flight<00:05:28.360> so

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
seconds with a killer set up flight so

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.090 
seconds with a killer set up flight so
the<00:05:29.570> killer<00:05:29.750> set<00:05:30.080> up<00:05:30.170> means<00:05:30.410> i<00:05:30.680> have<00:05:30.710> used

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
the killer set up means i have used

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.650 
the killer set up means i have used
bigger<00:05:31.490> propellers<00:05:31.850> as<00:05:32.210> i<00:05:32.300> just<00:05:32.360> mentioned

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
bigger propellers as i just mentioned

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.230 
bigger propellers as i just mentioned
and<00:05:33.230> these<00:05:33.440> propellers<00:05:33.800> i<00:05:34.130> actually<00:05:34.760> used<00:05:35.030> to

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
and these propellers i actually used to

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.170 
and these propellers i actually used to
fly<00:05:35.750> really<00:05:36.050> fast<00:05:36.200> agile<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.700> have<00:05:37.850> seen

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
fly really fast agile and you have seen

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.230 
fly really fast agile and you have seen
the<00:05:38.570> insane<00:05:39.110> climb<00:05:39.560> rate<00:05:39.830> on<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:40.310> baby<00:05:40.550> so

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
the insane climb rate on this baby so

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.300 
the insane climb rate on this baby so
that<00:05:41.480> propeller<00:05:42.260> I<00:05:42.500> mean<00:05:42.680> these<00:05:43.040> size

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
that propeller I mean these size

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.980 
that propeller I mean these size
propellers<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.150> actually<00:05:44.570> have<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:44.960> use

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
propellers you actually have to use

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.130 
propellers you actually have to use
smaller<00:05:45.620> sorry<00:05:46.400> less<00:05:47.150> voltage<00:05:47.450> batteries

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
smaller sorry less voltage batteries

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.790 
smaller sorry less voltage batteries
like<00:05:48.670> 14.8<00:05:49.670> volt<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.450> then<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.200> can<00:05:51.440> increase

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
like 14.8 volt and then you can increase

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.860 
like 14.8 volt and then you can increase
the<00:05:51.920> propeller<00:05:52.400> size<00:05:52.700> but<00:05:52.940> using<00:05:53.300> a<00:05:53.390> 6s

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
the propeller size but using a 6s

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.990 
the propeller size but using a 6s
battery<00:05:54.350> and<00:05:54.530> these<00:05:55.130> propellers<00:05:55.490> you'll<00:05:55.790> get

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
battery and these propellers you'll get

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.350 
battery and these propellers you'll get
insane<00:05:56.540> speed<00:05:56.990> and<00:05:57.170> instead<00:05:57.560> climb<00:05:58.280> rate<00:05:58.610> but

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
insane speed and instead climb rate but

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.290 
insane speed and instead climb rate but
also<00:06:00.260> your<00:06:00.860> batteries<00:06:01.340> will<00:06:01.520> drain<00:06:01.820> really

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
also your batteries will drain really

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.690 
also your batteries will drain really
really<00:06:02.540> fast<00:06:02.780> now<00:06:03.200> i<00:06:03.530> think<00:06:03.830> if<00:06:04.130> i<00:06:04.400> had<00:06:04.670> the

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
really fast now i think if i had the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.230 
really fast now i think if i had the
other<00:06:05.120> motors<00:06:05.660> not<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.320> scorpion<00:06:06.680> motors

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
other motors not the scorpion motors

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.370 
other motors not the scorpion motors
this<00:06:08.240> baby<00:06:08.510> would<00:06:08.750> have<00:06:08.810> drained<00:06:09.230> the

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
this baby would have drained the

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.890 
this baby would have drained the
batteries<00:06:09.830> in<00:06:09.860> 14<00:06:10.490> minutes<00:06:10.700> as<00:06:11.030> per<00:06:11.450> my<00:06:11.600> flying

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
batteries in 14 minutes as per my flying

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.470 
batteries in 14 minutes as per my flying
styles<00:06:12.380> and<00:06:12.560> i<00:06:12.830> was<00:06:13.010> testing<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.670> way<00:06:14.150> i<00:06:14.180> was

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
styles and i was testing the way i was

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.830 
styles and i was testing the way i was
flying<00:06:14.750> but<00:06:15.410> with<00:06:15.650> scorpion<00:06:16.160> motors<00:06:16.690> we<00:06:17.690> have

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
flying but with scorpion motors we have

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:32.679 
flying but with scorpion motors we have
achieved<00:06:17.990> 20<00:06:18.650> minutes

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.749
