the 5s 5c and iphone 6 bodies let's get
started<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.150> first<00:00:09.269> looking<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> device

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
started so first looking at the device

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.110 
started so first looking at the device
itself<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.130> tell<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.280> definitely<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.090> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
itself you can tell that definitely is a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.169 
itself you can tell that definitely is a
lot<00:00:12.389> bigger<00:00:12.570> than<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> iphone<00:00:13.469> 5<00:00:13.740> or<00:00:14.580> 5s<00:00:14.820> or<00:00:15.120> 5c

lot bigger than the iphone 5 or 5s or 5c

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.730 
lot bigger than the iphone 5 or 5s or 5c
in<00:00:15.599> comparison<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.139> taking<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> look<00:00:16.619> at<00:00:16.680> the

in comparison now taking a look at the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
in comparison now taking a look at the
device<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.279> tell<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> actual<00:00:18.240> body

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
device you can tell that the actual body

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.179 
device you can tell that the actual body
the<00:00:18.750> device<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> lot<00:00:19.410> different<00:00:19.619> running

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the device is a lot different running

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.410 
the device is a lot different running
out<00:00:20.279> from<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> side<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
out from the side you can see that the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.150 
out from the side you can see that the
sound<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> off<00:00:22.320> toggle<00:00:22.800> switch<00:00:22.980> looks

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
sound on and off toggle switch looks

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
sound on and off toggle switch looks
almost<00:00:23.369> exactly<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.910> same<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.720> moving

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
almost exactly the same and then moving

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.240 
almost exactly the same and then moving
down<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.350> see<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> volume<00:00:25.800> rockers

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
down you can see that the volume rockers

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.710 
down you can see that the volume rockers
did<00:00:26.519> gain<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> size<00:00:27.420> their

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
did gain a little bit of size their

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.050 
did gain a little bit of size their
length<00:00:28.529> probably<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.640> bit<00:00:29.789> easier<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
length probably little bit easier to

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060 
length probably little bit easier to
press<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.720> sure<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
press on for sure then going down to the

notice that there's just one bar speaker
now<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> older<00:00:45.600> iPhones<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> 5s<00:00:47.100> 5c

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
now on the older iPhones like the 5s 5c

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
now on the older iPhones like the 5s 5c
you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:49.020> sides

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
you can see that there are two sides

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
you can see that there are two sides
here<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> bottom<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.399> only<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> them

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
here on the bottom but only one of them

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.260 
here on the bottom but only one of them
actually<00:00:51.239> displays<00:00:52.219> sound<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.090> ones

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
actually displays sound the other ones

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.029 
actually displays sound the other ones
for<00:00:54.420> pickup<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.500> why<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> think

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
for pickup so that's why they I think

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
for pickup so that's why they I think
they<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.340> combine<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> into<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> six

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
they just combine it into one on the six

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.090 
they just combine it into one on the six
or<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.140> far<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> looks<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
or so far that's what it looks like

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.319 
or so far that's what it looks like
moving<00:00:59.430> around<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.879> side<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> can

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
moving around to the right side you can

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.639 
moving around to the right side you can
see<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> power<00:01:00.899> button<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.379> located

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
see that the power button is now located

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
see that the power button is now located
on<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.129> side<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
on the right side and not the top now it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
on the right side and not the top now it
is<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.549> different<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.610> first<00:01:05.820> when

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
is a little bit different at first when

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.039 
is a little bit different at first when
you're<00:01:06.060> thinking<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:06.900> you're

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
you're thinking about it because you're

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.450 
you're thinking about it because you're
like<00:01:07.170> wow<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> iphones<00:01:07.950> always<00:01:08.159> had<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
like wow the iphones always had on the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.370 
like wow the iphones always had on the
top<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.570> reason<00:01:09.930> behind<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
top but there is some reason behind this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.750 
top but there is some reason behind this
i<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> because

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
i think they make it like that because

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130 
i think they make it like that because
if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> reach<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.570> finger<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
if you were to reach your finger at the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
if you were to reach your finger at the
top<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> little<00:01:13.979> strenuous<00:01:14.250> without

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
top it can be a little strenuous without

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
top it can be a little strenuous without
sliding<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> phone<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> little<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:16.729> also

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
sliding the phone down a little bit also

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.190 
sliding the phone down a little bit also
reaching<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.630> around<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> phone<00:01:19.170> i

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
reaching all the way around the phone i

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
reaching all the way around the phone i
can<00:01:19.500> barely<00:01:19.920> reach<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.460> thumb<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.060> four

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
can barely reach my thumb to all four

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.850 
can barely reach my thumb to all four
corners<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> device<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.650> little

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
corners of this device it is a little

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
corners of this device it is a little
bit<00:01:23.009> difficult<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> reach<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
bit difficult so to have to reach the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
bit difficult so to have to reach the
power<00:01:24.810> button<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> top<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.770> my

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
power button on the top with just my

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.200 
power button on the top with just my
index<00:01:26.130> finger<00:01:26.189> could<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> annoying

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
index finger could be kind of annoying

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.429 
index finger could be kind of annoying
when<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.540> could<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> side<00:01:28.140> where<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
when it could be on the side where I can

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
when it could be on the side where I can
reach<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.770> multiple<00:01:29.189> fingers<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
reach it with multiple fingers so I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.280 
reach it with multiple fingers so I
think<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.450> probably<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> main<00:01:30.900> logic

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
think that's probably the main logic

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.649 
think that's probably the main logic
behind<00:01:31.590> having<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.420> side<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
behind having it on the right side of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.210 
behind having it on the right side of
device<00:01:33.990> instead<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> top<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> camera

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
device instead of on the top the camera

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
device instead of on the top the camera
layout<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.579> Vice<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.880> almost<00:01:36.090> exactly<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
layout of the Vice is almost exactly the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.050 
layout of the Vice is almost exactly the
same<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.259> has<00:01:37.380> been<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.829> 5s<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.430> 5c<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
same as it has been in the 5s and 5c and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
same as it has been in the 5s and 5c and
also<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> iphone<00:01:40.110> 5<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.770> camera<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
also the iphone 5 with the camera on the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
earpiece now the back of this demo

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
earpiece now the back of this demo
really<00:01:45.180> hasn't<00:01:45.329> had<00:01:45.689> too<00:01:45.869> much<00:01:45.960> work<00:01:46.200> done<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
really hasn't had too much work done to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100 
really hasn't had too much work done to
it<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.640> there's<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.720> nothing

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it as you can see there's really nothing

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
it as you can see there's really nothing
on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.829> besides<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> camera

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
on the back at all besides the camera

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.490 
on the back at all besides the camera
location<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.750> most<00:01:52.049> likely<00:01:52.200> where

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
location which is most likely where

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
location which is most likely where
exactly<00:01:52.740> it'll<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.909> there's<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> lot

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
exactly it'll be but there's not a lot

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.170 
exactly it'll be but there's not a lot
of<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:55.320> definition<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> yet<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.060> then

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
of really definition to it yet but then

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
of really definition to it yet but then
again<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.600> only<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.020> mock-up<00:01:58.200> there

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
again this is only just a mock-up there

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
again this is only just a mock-up there
hasn't<00:01:58.770> been<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.890> whole<00:01:59.040> lot<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.369> yet<00:01:59.640> so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
hasn't been a whole lot to it yet so

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.520 
hasn't been a whole lot to it yet so
right<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> case<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.259> was<00:02:01.350> sent

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
right here I have a case that was sent

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
right here I have a case that was sent
to<00:02:01.590> me<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:01.710> another<00:02:02.040> company<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.579> review<00:02:02.939> just

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to me by another company to review just

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
to me by another company to review just
a<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> rubber<00:02:04.049> stick<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.560> case<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.579> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
a kind of a rubber stick on case as you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.280 
a kind of a rubber stick on case as you
can<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> button<00:02:06.329> layout<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> exactly<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
can see the button layout is exactly the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.540 
can see the button layout is exactly the
same<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> mock<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
same as it is on the mock with the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.570 
same as it is on the mock with the
longer<00:02:08.970> buttons<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> side

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
longer buttons here on the side

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.690 
longer buttons here on the side
the<00:02:11.790> rocker<00:02:12.600> right<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.160> also<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the rocker right here and then also the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.300 
the rocker right here and then also the
button<00:02:15.270> lock<00:02:15.990> button<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> right<00:02:16.680> side<00:02:16.890> now

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
button lock button on the right side now

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.470 
button lock button on the right side now
with<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> phone<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.210> tell<00:02:18.450> that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
with the phone on it you can tell that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330 
with the phone on it you can tell that
it<00:02:18.690> actually<00:02:18.840> fits<00:02:19.290> perfectly<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> way

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
it actually fits perfectly all the way

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.620 
it actually fits perfectly all the way
around<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> buttons<00:02:21.120> lining<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.540> in

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
around with all the buttons lining up in

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.030 
around with all the buttons lining up in
the<00:02:21.720> spot<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.470> got<00:02:22.590> these<00:02:22.710> from<00:02:22.860> two

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the spot and I got these from two

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.740 
the spot and I got these from two
separate<00:02:23.340> people<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.730> sent<00:02:23.940> them<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> me<00:02:24.300> so

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
separate people that sent them to me so

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.150 
separate people that sent them to me so
obviously<00:02:25.110> there<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.410> some<00:02:25.560> sort<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.800> logic

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
obviously there is some sort of logic

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.890 
obviously there is some sort of logic
here<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.430> there's<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:26.910> different<00:02:27.090> companies

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
here if there's two different companies

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.320 
here if there's two different companies
sending<00:02:28.440> me<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> same<00:02:28.850> fitting<00:02:29.850> model<00:02:30.030> in

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
sending me the same fitting model in

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.120 
sending me the same fitting model in
terms<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.050> size<00:02:31.290> comparison<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:31.980> tell

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
terms of size comparison you can tell

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.560 
terms of size comparison you can tell
that<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.400> definitely<00:02:32.910> longer<00:02:33.330> than<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
that is definitely longer than the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.780 
that is definitely longer than the
iphone<00:02:33.870> 5s<00:02:34.290> as<00:02:34.470> well<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.040> quite<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:35.520> thinner

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
iphone 5s as well as quite a bit thinner

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.270 
iphone 5s as well as quite a bit thinner
so<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.630> definitely<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.140> big<00:02:37.350> step<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:38.070> for

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so this is definitely a big step up for

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.190 
so this is definitely a big step up for
Apple<00:02:38.640> seeing<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.970> generally<00:02:39.360> their<00:02:40.020> phone

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
Apple seeing is generally their phone

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
Apple seeing is generally their phone
stayed<00:02:40.470> about<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.250> same<00:02:41.430> size<00:02:41.790> don't<00:02:42.150> really

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
stayed about the same size don't really

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.000 
stayed about the same size don't really
change<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.720> much<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.530> also<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.830> get

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
change that much but then also to get

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.470 
change that much but then also to get
this<00:02:44.220> much<00:02:44.460> thinner<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.970> pretty<00:02:45.330> incredible

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
this much thinner is pretty incredible

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
this much thinner is pretty incredible
for<00:02:46.050> Apple<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.410> least<00:02:46.620> your<00:02:47.190> side<00:02:47.550> by<00:02:47.730> side

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
for Apple at least your side by side

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.020 
for Apple at least your side by side
with<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.390> iphone<00:02:48.780> 5c<00:02:49.260> again<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.220> lot<00:02:50.760> thinner

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
with the iphone 5c again a lot thinner

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.970 
with the iphone 5c again a lot thinner
than<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.330> 5c<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.810> also<00:02:52.200> extended<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.740> length

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
than the 5c and also extended in length

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.460 
than the 5c and also extended in length
both<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.610> 5c<00:02:54.030> 5s<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.720> iphone<00:02:55.020> 5<00:02:55.200> were<00:02:55.320> all

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
both the 5c 5s and iphone 5 were all

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.710 
both the 5c 5s and iphone 5 were all
four-point-oh<00:02:56.100> inch<00:02:56.310> screens<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.300> you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
four-point-oh inch screens so you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.580 
four-point-oh inch screens so you
wouldn't<00:02:57.810> expect<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.320> whole<00:02:58.440> lot<00:02:58.560> of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
wouldn't expect a whole lot of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.230 
wouldn't expect a whole lot of
difference<00:02:58.709> between<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> 5s<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.030> 5c

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
difference between the 5s and 5c

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.570 
difference between the 5s and 5c
comparison<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.770> here's<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> comparison<00:03:02.160> with

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
comparison and here's a comparison with

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.160 
comparison and here's a comparison with
all<00:03:02.730> devices<00:03:02.850> side<00:03:03.420> by<00:03:03.630> side<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.050> can

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
all devices side by side you can

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.960 
all devices side by side you can
definitely<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> iphone<00:03:05.340> 6<00:03:05.550> sticks<00:03:05.820> out

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970

a<00:03:06.000> little<00:03:06.060> bit<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.480> think<00:03:06.870> I'm<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.050> going<00:03:07.200> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
a little bit I think I'm really going to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.360 
a little bit I think I'm really going to
like<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> size<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.040> close<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
like the size of it it's close to the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.150 
like the size of it it's close to the
size<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> HTC<00:03:09.300> One<00:03:09.480> m8<00:03:09.750> galaxy<00:03:10.230> s5<00:03:10.560> no<00:03:10.830> 3
