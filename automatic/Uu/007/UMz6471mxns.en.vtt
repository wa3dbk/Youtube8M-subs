how<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> build<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.840> thing<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.289> use<00:00:28.949> quite<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
how to build this thing I use quite a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
how to build this thing I use quite a
variety<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.910> materials<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.199> build<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
variety of materials for this build to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
variety of materials for this build to
make<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> interesting<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.790> look<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.300> lot

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
make it interesting and look a lot

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.959 
make it interesting and look a lot
cooler<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.340> signs<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
cooler so as you can see like signs and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510 
cooler so as you can see like signs and
stuff<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> i<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.649> i'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> start<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
stuff so i think i'm going to start the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
stuff so i think i'm going to start the
build<00:00:38.700> about<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.710> right<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.739> start<00:00:41.190> off

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
build about here right just start off

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.880 
build about here right just start off
with<00:00:41.550> some<00:00:41.730> snow<00:00:42.620> court<00:00:43.620> stairs<00:00:44.420> like<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
with some snow court stairs like this

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.729 
with some snow court stairs like this
then<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.129> bedrock<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> wheels<00:00:48.750> if

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
then some bedrock for the wheels if

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
then some bedrock for the wheels if
you're<00:00:50.309> using<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.910> different<00:00:51.300> texture<00:00:51.629> pack

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you're using a different texture pack

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.080 
you're using a different texture pack
you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.770> ahead<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:54.230> like<00:00:55.230> black<00:00:55.530> wall

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
you can go ahead and use like black wall

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
you can go ahead and use like black wall
that<00:00:57.090> works<00:00:57.300> amazingly<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.190> also<00:00:59.399> go

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that works amazingly you can also go

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.830 
that works amazingly you can also go
ahead<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.590> use<00:01:01.590> coal<00:01:01.920> coal<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:03.420> does<00:01:03.600> look

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
ahead and use coal coal really does look

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
ahead and use coal coal really does look
like<00:01:03.899> tires<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> float<00:01:05.460> HD<00:01:05.939> texture<00:01:06.360> power

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
like tires in the float HD texture power

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.350 
like tires in the float HD texture power
which<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.799> awesome<00:01:07.830> feature<00:01:08.460> but

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
which is one really awesome feature but

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
which is one really awesome feature but
i'm<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.260> ahead<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.799> some

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
i'm just going to go ahead and use some

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.440 
i'm just going to go ahead and use some
bedrock<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.150> looks

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
bedrock because i think it just looks

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.760 
bedrock because i think it just looks
amazing<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:14.210> i<00:01:15.210> use<00:01:15.689> stairs<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.619> as

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
amazing so i use stairs on the side as

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.640 
amazing so i use stairs on the side as
well<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.159> i<00:01:17.310> don't<00:01:17.369> usually<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.150> cars

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
well which i don't usually do for cars

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.640 
well which i don't usually do for cars
because<00:01:19.650> once<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:20.970> sign<00:01:21.320> over<00:01:22.320> stairs

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
because once you put sign over stairs

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.980 
because once you put sign over stairs
they<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.280> come<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.060> amazing<00:01:24.720> as

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
they just come out and look amazing as

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.580 
they just come out and look amazing as
you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.100> still<00:01:26.310> see<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.759> looks<00:01:27.150> pretty<00:01:27.240> cool

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
you can still see it looks pretty cool

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
you can still see it looks pretty cool
and<00:01:28.590> I've<00:01:28.740> never<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.189> seen<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.700> done<00:01:29.909> on

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and I've never actually seen it done on

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.870 
and I've never actually seen it done on
a<00:01:30.210> car<00:01:30.689> before<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.369> another

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
a car before so it was just another

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
a car before so it was just another
feature<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.600> could<00:01:33.810> add<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> sorry<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
feature that I could add so sorry if I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
feature that I could add so sorry if I
keep<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.189> back<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> having<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.150> look<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
keep going back and having a look at the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170 
keep going back and having a look at the
car<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.259> entirely<00:01:40.710> sure<00:01:41.009> how<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> build

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
car I'm not entirely sure how to build

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.050 
car I'm not entirely sure how to build
this<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.869> scratch<00:01:43.579> simply<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:44.909> I've

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
this like to scratch simply because I've

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.389 
this like to scratch simply because I've
only<00:01:45.180> built<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.689> once<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.619> fought<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
only built at once and I fought that is

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.670 
only built at once and I fought that is
so<00:01:47.700> cool<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> YouTube<00:01:49.290> video<00:01:49.439> on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
so cool I have to do a YouTube video on

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.510 
so cool I have to do a YouTube video on
this<00:01:50.570> since<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.899> inspiration<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.130> YouTube

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
this since the inspiration for YouTube

this since the inspiration for YouTube
is<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:54.060> slightly<00:01:54.509> at<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> moment<00:01:55.140> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is going slightly at the moment but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
with iron then but really doesn't matter

use<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.500> wheels<00:03:14.710> it<00:03:14.950> generally<00:03:15.520> just

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
use for the wheels it generally just

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.940 
use for the wheels it generally just
looks<00:03:16.000> sick<00:03:16.330> but<00:03:17.110> just<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:17.740> particular

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
looks sick but just for this particular

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.820 
looks sick but just for this particular
build<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.850> think<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.630> simple<00:03:20.140> ism<00:03:20.440> needed

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
build I think just the simple ism needed

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.970 
build I think just the simple ism needed
to<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.750> like<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.960> feature<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.650> build

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
to be like a feature of this build

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.580 
to be like a feature of this build
simply<00:03:24.460> because<00:03:24.730> if<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.000> put<00:03:25.210> item<00:03:25.570> frames<00:03:25.960> up

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
simply because if I put item frames up

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.860 
simply because if I put item frames up
in<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.370> bill<00:03:27.610> then<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.000> may<00:03:28.180> look<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.480> bit<00:03:28.510> over

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
in this bill then it may look a bit over

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.460 
in this bill then it may look a bit over
the<00:03:28.990> top<00:03:29.020> but<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.910> did<00:03:31.390> put<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.660> sign<00:03:32.020> on<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.260> back

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
the top but I did put a sign on the back

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.340 
the top but I did put a sign on the back
here<00:03:32.820> because<00:03:33.820> if<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.300> put<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.660> equals<00:03:35.140> at<00:03:35.320> a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
here because if you put like equals at a

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.430 
here because if you put like equals at a
top<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.920> then<00:03:36.760> like<00:03:37.060> for<00:03:37.660> example<00:03:37.750> I'm<00:03:38.410> going

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
top and then like for example I'm going

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.000
