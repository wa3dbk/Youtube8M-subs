00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.379
 I remember a game on all of Rome 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.510
 who is winning the scudetto 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
 at the Olympic stadium all sold out 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.670
 scudetto that comes the relegated lecce 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.400
 he loses it at home in his home and then in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 a daring game to say 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 rocambolesca and little in the episodes that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 which happened in all that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.930
 It happens 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.990
 but like this they have also been passed 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.400
 others where we have always said that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 however, we must respect our own 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 opponents we must respect them 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.270
 respect but also by virtue of that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.320
 that their recent history 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.210
 because the reggina is a team from 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.219
 quality player is a team that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.809
 outside the home he had some difficulties 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.789
 at home but always away from home 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.500
 created a situation of great danger 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.020
 to opponents 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.120
 and a team that has always made goals and that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.010
 fast attackers of depth that type 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.140
 puts quality players in trouble 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.420
 as of michele as final dumitru 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.280
 to say here turn to say a few 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.000
 name only but then to not go to 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.740
 touch other young people who have e 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.510
 unfortunately, maybe it's a team that is 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.490
 stumbled in a season a little see 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.530
 how the Paduan is a team that if 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.780
 then there are players at the agi names also 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 of excellent quality but it runs into one 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.460
 season where you find yourself even 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 maybe you realize it slowly and slowly 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 pass the days that maybe 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.479
 points come less and less but quality 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.290
 of the team and also for what 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.750
 they are doing 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.180
 the commitment they are putting in place and 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.610
 hence the difficulties of the game 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.509
 these things only speak here 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.280
 this is a forward team out 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.190
 home from the meltdown at a time 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 where the carpi I still had the old 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.020
 coach was fighting for the play offs 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.179
 he did so between goals to make it 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.190
 away from home he scored two goals in Padua 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.500
 outside the house he made two more 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.600
 previously in pescara have tied 2 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.520
 2 on the field at a time when pescara 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.679
 even in the school that was traveling 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.090
 ai is traveling maybe in that least 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.009
 with wings of enthusiasm because he had 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.049
 changed coach and there was this with 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.150
 cosmi that there was this of capitini ci 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.100
 are all the premises for the palermo 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.700
 must face this match with 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.700
 great concentration great attention 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.980
 organization respect and mentality 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.060
 right here there is no one but a belly 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 full 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.930
 woe if it were so we must always 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.130
 go in search of continuos 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.670
 continuous knowledge improvements 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.599
 continuous search for 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.250
 first of all the first objective 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.940
 to want to arrive as soon as possible a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.590
 reach a mathematical quota of di 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.709
 then there is no promotion yet 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.260
 we must work to the maximum 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.720
 to go in search of this e 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.090
 this is our first thought today 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.829
 then tomorrow we will see but today is this and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 so to do this we will have to be 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.120
 always super organized to have one 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.620
 right mindset a right spirit 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.970
 right attitudes in all that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.470
 we do in the preparation of 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.500
 game the moment we descend into 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.810
 camp but given that in football there are 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.730
 episodes and tactical situations 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.680
 I don't think we have drills 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.989
 all reduce performance 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.420
 that on that episode there because the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.849
 team if not allowed to do anything else 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.190
 panel drills because we have always been 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.450
 we have the ball in our feet 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.549
 managed ball possession like 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.620
 percentage of ownership if we remove the 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.840
 last ten minutes where he came to 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.849
 miss a bit of how can I say of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.319
 intensity but the team for 80 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.819
 minutes he had had we held a 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.590
 pressing high we forced the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.690
 external to them to lower then be 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 their tips less dangerous ahead 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.750
 away from the door and from the area of 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.690
 strictness 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.849
 we have created at least 89 situations and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.079
 important occasions to score goals 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.480
 I did n't reduce it all to 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.129
 that episode there for that is part of 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.230
 a game context where second 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.700
 me we had the mistake of not 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.079
 unlock the game first and don't 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.010
 close it when we have had it 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.010
 different opportunities
