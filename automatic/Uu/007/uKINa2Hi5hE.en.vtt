00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.390
 strictly speaking 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 dÃ¼lmen 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.599
 than in the semester break 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.060
 then I will go to work weekend 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.200
 I have to write my five term papers which I have to do for Bachelor and to work with 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.869
 my little daughter and if my friend percent from Hana Barcelona 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.949
 in my last would be 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.890
 I have to become wise the son Leander we from the DLR 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.530
 his company has my request I would like to become a list of shortcomings 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.750
 if we have no holidays 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 So to have to learn a lot then is three days earlier from the writer 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.160
 which study to finish quickly and Henry a accordingly 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 Standard study period finished Exinda Edge Cache Region is able to learn 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 Carnival but also celebrate and otherwise travel is unfortunately not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.980
 Unfortunately I also have to use it during the semester break 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.350
 make it deserved but maybe it succeeds a bit 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.220
 in a semester of that, it will have to be quite private this time 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.430
 at Smartrac organizer 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.800
 and that's good to do somehow 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.710
 I can learn a lot 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.520
 very much like to go to the theater sometimes 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.920
 at the moment there is not something to break around, among other things 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.530
 obtained by that I assume 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.760
 Martin Sheen by Kostheim 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.560
 because I thought that traffic has to be done now you definitely have a reason for it 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.920
 to have an alarm 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.700
 So get up at 8 9 o'clock so that's okay the course is likely 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.820
 not very interesting but then you have at least something 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.940
 make the guest 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.860
 and I probably have a few trips around here so Amsterdam Paris 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 something like Vienna 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010
