and

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
and

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.380 
and
that<00:04:34.870> works<00:04:35.169> really<00:04:35.409> well<00:04:35.530> just

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.460 

are<00:04:38.510> you

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
for combating puffy eyes especially and

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.360 
for combating puffy eyes especially and

we bring tea i know it contains an

we bring tea i know it contains an
anti-inflammatory<00:05:04.040> call<00:05:04.820> it

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
anti-inflammatory call it

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.250 
anti-inflammatory call it
CG<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.599> that<00:05:07.110> helps<00:05:07.439> reduce

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.500 

so<00:05:11.470> essentially<00:05:11.920> what<00:05:12.220> you<00:05:12.400> want

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
so essentially what you want

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.220 
so essentially what you want
is<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.810> take<00:05:14.110> two<00:05:14.740> bags<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.640> that<00:05:16.120> and

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.380 

and<00:05:19.500> statement<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.370> threw<00:05:20.730> it

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
and statement and threw it

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.070 
and statement and threw it
the<00:05:22.690> Chiefs<00:05:23.080> brother<00:05:23.350> doin<00:05:23.770> at<00:05:23.950> me

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
the Chiefs brother doin at me

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.749 
the Chiefs brother doin at me
and<00:05:26.199> obviously<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:26.979> can<00:05:27.250> drink<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.550> green

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
and obviously you can drink the green

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.129 
and obviously you can drink the green
tea<00:05:27.939> because

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.150 

for<00:05:33.620> about<00:05:33.740> 15<00:05:34.219> min

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
for about 15 min

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.470 
for about 15 min
right<00:05:35.760> over<00:05:35.970> your<00:05:36.210> eyes<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:36.960> really<00:05:37.260> does

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.460 

whines

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
whines

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.870 
whines
and<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.740> minimizes<00:05:43.340> that

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
and it minimizes that

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.770 
and it minimizes that
really<00:05:44.510> really<00:05:44.810> well

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
really really well

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.850 
really really well
I<00:05:46.810> remember<00:05:47.290> specifically

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
I remember specifically

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.909 
I remember specifically
pulling<00:05:49.129> an<00:05:49.250> all-nighter<00:05:49.460> for<00:05:50.060> an<00:05:50.300> exam<00:05:50.659> and<00:05:51.169> I

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
pulling an all-nighter for an exam and I

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.790 
pulling an all-nighter for an exam and I
lived<00:05:52.280> really<00:05:52.729> refreshed<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.629> like<00:05:54.500> I<00:05:54.650> had

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
lived really refreshed and like I had

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.760 
lived really refreshed and like I had
gotten<00:05:55.039> a<00:05:55.219> good<00:05:55.400> night's<00:05:55.639> sleep

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.770 

so<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.580> time<00:06:01.819> that<00:06:02.060> i<00:06:02.090> recommend<00:06:02.660> the

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
so the time that i recommend the

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.129 
so the time that i recommend the
stronger<00:06:03.379> the<00:06:03.740> tea<00:06:03.949> the<00:06:04.129> more<00:06:04.310> high<00:06:04.490> quality

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
stronger the tea the more high quality

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.279 
stronger the tea the more high quality

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
and the better your results

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:15.830 
and the better your results
I<00:06:08.379> use

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.590 

if<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.230> grain<00:06:16.470> team<00:06:16.740> has<00:06:17.070> super<00:06:17.730> antioxidants

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
if the grain team has super antioxidants

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.570 
if the grain team has super antioxidants
in

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
in

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.939 
in

the<00:06:32.750> morning<00:06:33.230> to<00:06:33.410> just

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.580

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
and that should help

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.159 
and that should help
one<00:06:42.740> other<00:06:42.979> kind<00:06:43.550> of<00:06:43.699> old-school<00:06:44.419> trick<00:06:45.020> of

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
one other kind of old-school trick of

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.839 
one other kind of old-school trick of
the<00:06:45.199> trade<00:06:45.379> is<00:06:45.830> to<00:06:46.400> take<00:06:46.610> a<00:06:46.639> spoon

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
the trade is to take a spoon

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.239 
the trade is to take a spoon
like<00:06:48.089> a<00:06:48.119> tablespoon<00:06:48.689> like<00:06:48.929> this<00:06:49.169> freeze<00:06:49.979> it

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
like a tablespoon like this freeze it

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.089 
like a tablespoon like this freeze it
and<00:06:50.520> actually<00:06:51.300> put<00:06:51.839> it<00:06:51.990> over<00:06:52.169> your<00:06:52.319> eye<00:06:52.499> and<00:06:52.919> is

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
and actually put it over your eye and is

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.200 
and actually put it over your eye and is
supposed<00:06:53.490> to<00:06:53.729> reduce<00:06:53.959> puffiness

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
supposed to reduce puffiness

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.779 
supposed to reduce puffiness
pretty<00:06:56.780> much<00:06:56.960> any<00:06:57.229> cold<00:06:57.650> compress<00:06:58.430> will<00:06:58.639> do

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
pretty much any cold compress will do

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.189 
pretty much any cold compress will do
that<00:06:58.970> but<00:06:59.240> I<00:06:59.270> think<00:06:59.360> it's<00:06:59.690> something<00:06:59.870> maybe

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 
that but I think it's something maybe

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.510 
that but I think it's something maybe
about<00:07:00.470> the<00:07:00.620> metallic

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
about the metallic

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.920 
about the metallic
shipments

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.119 

so<00:07:05.380> will

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:07.129 
so will

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:08.500 
so will
that<00:07:07.369> works

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
that works

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.860 
that works
you<00:07:08.780> can<00:07:08.960> also<00:07:09.200> take<00:07:09.710> it<00:07:09.920> I<00:07:10.010> didn't<00:07:10.280> have

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
you can also take it I didn't have

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.520 
you can also take it I didn't have
here<00:07:11.530> can<00:07:11.890> also<00:07:11.980> take<00:07:12.430> a<00:07:12.700> potato<00:07:13.150> and<00:07:13.720> slice<00:07:14.500> it

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
here can also take a potato and slice it

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.780 
here can also take a potato and slice it
especially<00:07:15.070> in<00:07:15.340> a<00:07:15.400> half<00:07:15.580> moon<00:07:15.850> shape

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:17.790 
especially in a half moon shape

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.700 
especially in a half moon shape
with<00:07:18.030> dark<00:07:18.390> and<00:07:18.690> fluffy

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.010
