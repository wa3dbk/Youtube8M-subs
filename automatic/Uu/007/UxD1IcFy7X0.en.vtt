00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 hey people are here to start and we are 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.330
 come back to another round 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 battlefield 4 today in live chats 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.280
 comments style we are on the go 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 team deathmatch together as city ​​with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 the l 85 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 I have my beautiful curiosity like that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 she's on a heavy run and the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.369
 Angled grip around the whole 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 to give a little stability 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.150
 I 've been about 80 too far myself 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.099
 here on golmud we raver here 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.570
 just a little bit further on 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.489
 Easier removal with the part I do 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 find the l 85 bad form already the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.370
 first of all they will get away the same 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.870
 had no chance on the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 remove them for the sniper and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.680
 Deep down a bit or pick 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 Of course, our colleagues are covered 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.489
 pack here as medicine and take 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.930
 first cover this is the first round 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.250
 By the way today and I thought so 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.140
 you have wished 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 in the last battlefield 4 video where i am 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.199
 hey said what do you want in the frame of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.610
 Battlefield actually on a canal 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.570
 continue to see because so many 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 there are no possibilities anymore 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.539
 Play already pretty exhausted and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.620
 but often the live tactics with it 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.090
 and generally a bit live 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 Gameplay and I thought that was me 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 knows here and now is the time 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.369
 next opponent away from safe cover 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 and for those who know what that is im 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.909
 the final result I play here live it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 Live does not comment on comments 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 and there 's a little bit on mine 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.100
 things I do why I do them 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.020
 Why I'm here now, for example 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 lying down and sliding down because of me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 The grenade with I turn around 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 gone is a full happiness i thought 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.229
 Actually this is a flash 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 safety've ever 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.159
 Turned away and now you already hear 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.020
 behind the wall comes one 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.789
 of course you have that easy 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.530
 heard now through the new audi option 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.590
 this is one of the last patches 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.819
 Of course, there is another 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.469
 Of course, you 're better off, too 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.179
 must really pay attention to his surroundings then 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.520
 does the euro grant the 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.179
 behind me that just a parachute 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.770
 come across 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.000
 we cut here's a mini parcel 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.170
 so that it is a bit safe from 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.909
 this is not the way it is here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.979
 easily broken and cover the page here 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.530
 but we are here parallel to us 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.979
 people my smog over there comes too 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.390
 already and hh still clicks away 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.189
 had luck with zest doing a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.869
 a bit shaky since the first round today 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.489
 First of all, my hand needs a little bit 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.200
 Import form due to the fact 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.140
 that yes, I am battlefield 4 in general 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.239
 not played so often in 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.190
 the last time were there but rather 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.959
 one or other games foreground 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 but now we have to go 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.620
 of course, show what I can live 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.230
 tactics live commented situations 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.910
 analyzed for you with it 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.310
 you just a little something from me 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.750
 if you want to adapt my playing style 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.950
 Of course you like it 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.879
 Now a few I opponent's times since 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.840
 over there because he is coming 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.130
 most likely because of this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.319
 Of course, we take care to throw medi 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.700
 kit so that I am a bit backup 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.250
 but unfortunately it is a bit high 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.680
 also already and go behind i have him 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.970
 but get caught from behind many 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.579
 People, I'll go and see theirs for a moment 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.459
 safety and I am really myself 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.870
 because I'm far too much here too 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.889
 have a lot of open space below 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.180
 make away now we see that me 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.599
 a little push to the corners 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.799
 the hands are still 67 percent 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.329
 plonk 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.500
 this will be available again as well 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.430
 of course, that the colleagues from above 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.829
 cover me up a bit 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.299
 otherwise this will be a hard iron 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.700
 but we have two people on the left 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.440
 he is on the right and left 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.849
 currently no but we can with 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.889
 give fire with our colleagues children 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.840
 try away to revive again 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.910
 stop butt I am indeed sorry but sometimes 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.299
 to the need to but one or 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.470
 other balls catch boys with them 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.160
 against the opponents of the benefits had 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.930
 was actually more dead 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.340
 that 's our own there I have now 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.870
 just the font not seen 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.520
 actually worth of new made war 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.160
 maybe revive does that otherwise 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.480
 helps me to do that 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.240
 adversaries beneficial from because we in the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.130
 221 situation and most of the time if one 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.200
 opponent counts on you and he sees that 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.790
 he he revived one of the first 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.110
 revived shoots because of one 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.330
 easy goal is to be found on 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.270
 ground he has to get up for free and is 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.190
 thus the possibility of the split second 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.730
 millisecond then the enemy under fire 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.340
 to take 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.300
 that makes a lot of therefore 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.340
 Of course, people should not 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.110
 meaningless revive but in such 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.570
 This is not the case 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.760
 wrong because it looks bad 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.350
 not really collapsed colleagues 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.180
 on the one hand has the possibility again 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.370
 to come and on the side of the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.960
 possibility to shoot the opponent away 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.160
 and hat is the right thing for me 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.870
 always better to fire in 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.190
 That was not a stupid idea there would be 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.320
 Neither does it sound like a nanu now 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.480
 especially that was really ideal 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.310
 as well as that is actually meant 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.320
 he did well again wiesbaden 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.180
 run because on the one hand there he is 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 of course team deathmatch is here that is 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.120
 similarly possible with the own people 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.970
 on the other hand even if it's one 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.190
 Other modes I would be in it 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.890
 spawn now has caliber with 50s 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.510
 tattoo my god on the distance 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.610
 climate is it look we are here 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.340
 goslar child on the stone so I know 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.730
 I also try a little bit out now 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.050
 get 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.030
 the smog grenades are coming in now 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.440
 I'm trying my smog wand 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.340
 build back and go now 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.180
 front from here a second wall and 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.070
 Try me a little bit here 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.380
 hide and pulled me still after 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.150
 further forward to the corner behind the 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.340
 Wall then I'm definitely 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.750
 secured against the sniper and must 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.450
 of course, but watching it right here 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.710
 in close touch is the l 85 then too 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.080
 not the a and o 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.090
 you see in the medium distance bz-wide 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.850
 dance just fine with the setup 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.940
 but on short distances due to the 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.650
 fire power resp 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.660
 the fire rate is not more effective than you 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.350
 here we have the japanese project 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.919
 can do 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.480
 short fireburst in any case 85 a and 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.430
 o of course with every weapon but me 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.570
 keep stressing it and I have to 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.620
 Again and again emphasize more here 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.090
 now a claymore lie 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.820
 I'll go outside I do not know if 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.310
 the of 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.020
 us or from another okay yes 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.250
 he did it right, turned around 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.640
 he has not got me fired yet 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.500
 seen 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.510
 Wolbecks reacts correctly with the skate 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.340
 celebrated i jumped in yes that 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.510
 was my mistake but i thought honestly 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.830
 not said that he turns around and 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.570
 fire but that he keeps going because 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.160
 Nikkei was lying and he would have thought 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.090
 can hey moment here also runs into the 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.770
 clamp in now I'm with 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.230
 curiously, that's another 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.070
 thing about own mails where you 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.470
 can save 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.460
 which I find a bit safer than 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.280
 if you join now, for example 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.460
 Teammates Sport I'll be back 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.650
 revive in 104 and that is how it is 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.590
 it's safe to come here now 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.310
 quickly in the cover has become 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.930
 withdrawn 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.240
 here behind the cover medi packs 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.550
 the main upstairs on the house so 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.360
 okay I'll go up and screw it up 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.740
 one is now no reason to see that 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.600
 grenade goes up again 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.400
 around the spring radio is a bit too 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.080
 of course I have escaped again 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.130
 media child always 100 percent whole 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.730
 important thing coming from below now 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.500
 i jumped and martin woke me up 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.210
 I jumped down the stairs because 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.920
 I thus temporarily not visible 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.330
 the war was fast as I was 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.130
 do not know if come from the bottom right and 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.060
 the here comes me where I may 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.170
 then I could just get caught 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.250
 the one defi jobs with the 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.450
 jumped a lot because I saw 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.560
 that then back off pension and 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.410
 there's another one I'll jump 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.850
 after all , at least the idea was wolbeck 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.590
 sentence but also seen now with the l 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.480
 85 on the way however the 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.130
 There are still silencers on there 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.260
 made the job we are currently 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.090
 more or less in the half the 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.580
 round has 400 tickets 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.920
 Of course I do not want to go with that 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.940
 a 40 minute gameplay here somehow 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.980
 check in 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.930
 from her naturally want pity that 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.400
 one rear lower the comments pure 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.400
 but if I'm in any danger if you 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.440
 more of the live tactics gameplays 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.580
 want to have then write that too 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.470
 in the comments and leave the 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.560
 thumb up and you have the 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.570
 possibility to vote which weapon I 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.460
 should play next in the life 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.980
 tactics mode here 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.840
 so your weapon writes you off 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.730
 just wanted to play me 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.260
 below the comments and gives the 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.430
 Weapons that you like are called thumbs 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.810
 top so first check the 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.160
 comments because maybe he stands that 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.930
 weapon you already write 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.670
 like in there and just give it 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.080
 a thumb up and the weapon with 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.920
 I will then vote for the most votes 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.690
 next time game 

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.240
 I hope see you next time 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.630
 video in this sense berlet goal in 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.630
 eye
