and<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> battery<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.740> have<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and this is the battery and have a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.139 
and this is the battery and have a
keyboard<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.399> basically<00:01:47.700> pretty<00:01:48.030> much

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
keyboard it's basically pretty much

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
keyboard it's basically pretty much
similar<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> keyboard<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:50.040> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
have this a dedicated base so we can

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.480 
have this a dedicated base so we can
access<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.290> internals<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.860> hard<00:02:45.100> drive<00:02:45.280> and

access the internals the hard drive and
the<00:02:45.610> memory<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:47.410> a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the memory so it's going to be like a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.040 
the memory so it's going to be like a
mainstream<00:02:48.280> laptop<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.540> good<00:02:49.690> part<00:02:49.900> is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
mainstream laptop and the good part is

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
mainstream laptop and the good part is
going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.410> cheap<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.130> will<00:02:51.280> start<00:02:51.520> about

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
going to be cheap it will start about

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.770 
going to be cheap it will start about
500<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.050> something<00:02:53.460> $600<00:02:54.460> so<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.570> will<00:02:55.690> be

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
500 and something $600 so you will be

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.300
