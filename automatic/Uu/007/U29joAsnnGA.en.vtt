00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
fish having been purified so it's a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
fish having been purified so it's a
great<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.390> also<00:02:24.569> demonstrate<00:02:25.230> what<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
great way to also demonstrate what a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.099 
great way to also demonstrate what a

cyclical ecosystem is and how that can

cyclical ecosystem is and how that can
function<00:02:28.350> which<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.880> want<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> use<00:02:30.150> as

they can function more like close with

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
with cities right now is that they

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
with cities right now is that they

today<00:03:46.190> one<00:03:46.670> way<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.910> do<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.269> by<00:03:47.480> creating

today one way to do that is by creating

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
things is basic is that developing what

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.450 
things is basic is that developing what
we<00:04:31.910> call<00:04:32.090> ecological<00:04:32.660> literacy<00:04:33.080> if<00:04:34.010> we<00:04:34.160> really

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
we call ecological literacy if we really

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.000 
we call ecological literacy if we really
want<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.910> see<00:04:35.300> these<00:04:35.630> changes<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:36.800> talked

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
want to see these changes that we talked

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.260 
want to see these changes that we talked
about<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.370> transition<00:04:37.849> permaculture

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
about in the transition permaculture

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.670 
about in the transition permaculture
movement<00:04:38.750> go<00:04:39.580> exponential<00:04:40.900> then<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.410> means

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
movement go exponential then that means

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.260 
movement go exponential then that means
being<00:04:43.130> active<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:44.889> in<00:04:45.889> dominant<00:04:46.789> culture<00:04:47.090> in

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
being active in in dominant culture in

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.980 
being active in in dominant culture in
society<00:04:48.139> in<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.440> world<00:04:49.060> which<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.090> really

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
society in the world which is really

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.529 
society in the world which is really
happening<00:04:51.410> in<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.949> urban<00:04:52.310> environments<00:04:52.539> and

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
happening in in urban environments and

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.980 
happening in in urban environments and
that<00:04:54.470> if<00:04:54.560> we<00:04:54.650> can<00:04:54.800> make<00:04:54.949> changes<00:04:55.220> there<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.960> I

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
that if we can make changes there that I

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.860 
that if we can make changes there that I
think<00:04:57.650> will<00:04:57.740> see<00:04:57.949> them<00:04:58.160> spread<00:04:58.699> quite<00:04:59.479> rapidly

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
think will see them spread quite rapidly

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.750 
think will see them spread quite rapidly

money you know what can you get started
on<00:05:54.620> right<00:05:54.830> now<00:05:54.860> because<00:05:55.220> i<00:05:55.280> think<00:05:55.460> that's

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
on right now because i think that's

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.870 
on right now because i think that's
that's<00:05:56.630> very<00:05:56.750> empowering<00:05:57.410> for<00:05:57.620> people<00:05:57.950> to<00:05:58.700> be

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
that's very empowering for people to be

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.690 
that's very empowering for people to be
like<00:05:58.910> to<00:05:59.570> grow<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.380> vegetable<00:06:00.860> in<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.460> pot<00:06:01.670> and

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
like to grow a vegetable in a pot and

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.470 
like to grow a vegetable in a pot and
say<00:06:02.060> i<00:06:02.090> did<00:06:02.630> this<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.790> even<00:06:04.790> if<00:06:04.970> in<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.300> big

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
say i did this and even if in the big

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.300 
say i did this and even if in the big
picture<00:06:05.840> it's<00:06:06.230> terribly<00:06:06.650> negligible

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
picture it's terribly negligible

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.180 
picture it's terribly negligible
whatever<00:06:08.240> he<00:06:08.570> gave<00:06:08.780> them<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.050> sense<00:06:09.260> of<00:06:09.410> pride

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
whatever he gave them the sense of pride

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.400 
whatever he gave them the sense of pride
and<00:06:10.220> confidence<00:06:10.640> and<00:06:11.060> made<00:06:11.270> them<00:06:11.420> feel<00:06:11.630> like

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
and confidence and made them feel like

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.650 
and confidence and made them feel like
they<00:06:12.590> could<00:06:12.650> do<00:06:13.010> something

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.690 

and<00:06:15.780> then<00:06:16.440> if<00:06:16.710> you<00:06:16.890> get<00:06:17.010> enough<00:06:17.190> people<00:06:17.460> doing

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
and then if you get enough people doing

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.310 
and then if you get enough people doing
that<00:06:17.820> and<00:06:18.030> then<00:06:18.180> if<00:06:18.300> they<00:06:18.420> start<00:06:18.840> connecting

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
that and then if they start connecting

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.870 
that and then if they start connecting
with<00:06:19.590> each<00:06:19.650> other<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.190> communicating<00:06:20.760> with

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
with each other and communicating with

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.870 
with each other and communicating with
each<00:06:20.940> other<00:06:21.120> it's<00:06:21.990> like<00:06:22.200> the<00:06:22.560> then<00:06:23.490> it<00:06:23.670> just

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
each other it's like the then it just

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:32.870 
each other it's like the then it just
the<00:06:24.570> potential<00:06:25.110> is<00:06:25.170> enormous

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880
