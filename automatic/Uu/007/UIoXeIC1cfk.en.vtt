hi<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.390> Chris<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.690> shape<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.770> today

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
hi this is Chris with shape and today

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.080 
hi this is Chris with shape and today
we're<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.280> going<00:00:08.490> over<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.760> shoulder

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we're going to be going over a shoulder

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.730 
we're going to be going over a shoulder
exercise<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.840> really<00:00:10.170> focuses<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
exercise that really focuses on the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.890 
exercise that really focuses on the
front<00:00:11.070> area<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.550> deltoids<00:00:12.059> we're<00:00:12.660> gonna<00:00:12.750> be

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
front area that deltoids we're gonna be

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.220 
front area that deltoids we're gonna be
using<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.910> elastic<00:00:14.910> resistance<00:00:15.630> bands<00:00:15.929> today

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
using the elastic resistance bands today

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
using the elastic resistance bands today
and<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.490> great<00:00:17.670> obviously<00:00:18.060> because

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and these are great obviously because

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.640 
and these are great obviously because
they're<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> nice<00:00:18.510> portable<00:00:18.869> exercise

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
they're a nice portable exercise

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
they're a nice portable exercise
equipment<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.730> use<00:00:20.820> anywhere<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
equipment that you can use anywhere you

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.960 
equipment that you can use anywhere you
need<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> small<00:00:22.500> amount<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.769> space<00:00:22.970> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
need just a small amount of space so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.759 
need just a small amount of space so
what<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> least

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
what you want to do is to get the least

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.170 
what you want to do is to get the least
amount<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> resistance<00:00:26.160> starting<00:00:26.820> off<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
amount of resistance starting off to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
amount of resistance starting off to
make<00:00:27.300> sure<00:00:27.420> you've<00:00:27.539> got<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> technique

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
make sure you've got the technique

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
make sure you've got the technique
correct<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.760> go<00:00:29.849> ahead<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.060> step<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
correct just go ahead and step on it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
correct just go ahead and step on it
with<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.810> foot<00:00:31.189> when<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.369> two<00:00:32.579> feet

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
with one foot when you do two feet

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.010 
with one foot when you do two feet
obviously<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.450> tension<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.899> it's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
obviously there's more tension so it's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.010 
obviously there's more tension so it's
gonna<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.230> more<00:00:34.350> resistance<00:00:35.660> we're<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
gonna be more resistance we're to do it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
gonna be more resistance we're to do it
this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.380> obviously<00:00:37.770> work<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> front<00:00:38.340> area

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
this is obviously work in the front area

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
this is obviously work in the front area
of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> deltoid<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.809> we're<00:00:40.140> gonna<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.410> just

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of the deltoid so we're gonna be just

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
of the deltoid so we're gonna be just
you<00:00:41.190> doing<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> front<00:00:41.969> raise<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.570> we're<00:00:43.020> gonna

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you doing the front raise so we're gonna

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
you doing the front raise so we're gonna
raise<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> eye<00:00:44.010> level<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
raise to about the eye level with the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.650 
raise to about the eye level with the
band<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.739> down<00:00:47.059> have<00:00:48.059> nice<00:00:48.300> little

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
band and then back down have nice little

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
band and then back down have nice little
you<00:00:49.079> know<00:00:49.170> knee<00:00:49.530> flex<00:00:50.899> up<00:00:52.010> flex<00:00:53.010> over<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> top

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you know knee flex up flex over the top

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
you know knee flex up flex over the top
you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.820> feel<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.570> feel<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you can feel that you really feel the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420 
you can feel that you really feel the
tension<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> front<00:00:55.920> area<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.340> your

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
tension on the front area of your

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
tension on the front area of your
shoulders<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> front<00:00:57.539> deltoid<00:00:58.820> up

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
shoulders here it's the front deltoid up

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
shoulders here it's the front deltoid up
nice<00:01:00.750> slow<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.050> controlled<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> way

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
nice slow and controlled all the way

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
nice slow and controlled all the way
through<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> movement<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.850> down<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.539> if

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
through the movement back down now if

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.020 
through the movement back down now if
you<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.019> more<00:01:04.199> resistance<00:01:05.030> go

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you want to have more resistance go

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
you want to have more resistance go
ahead<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.270> step<00:01:06.920> with<00:01:07.920> both<00:01:08.130> feet<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
ahead and step with both feet on the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
ahead and step with both feet on the
band's<00:01:09.320> it's<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> feel<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> more

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
band's it's gonna have you feel the more

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.289 
band's it's gonna have you feel the more
tension<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.729> gonna<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.119> more

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
tension it's gonna be a little more

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.980 
tension it's gonna be a little more
resistance<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:14.010> ahead<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.990> front

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
resistance here so go ahead and up front

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
resistance here so go ahead and up front
raise<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.619> about<00:01:16.799> eye<00:01:16.830> level<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
raise all the way about eye level and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.710 
raise all the way about eye level and
then<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.240> nice<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.750> slow<00:01:19.220> up<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.720> then

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
then back down nice and slow up and then

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.990 
then back down nice and slow up and then
back<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:23.189> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> come<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.939> eye

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
back down you want to come about eye

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.730 
back down you want to come about eye
level<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.509> don't<00:01:24.659> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.930> too<00:01:25.140> low<00:01:25.350> here

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
level you don't want to be too low here

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
level you don't want to be too low here
because<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> doesn't<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.460> anything<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
because it doesn't do anything and you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
because it doesn't do anything and you
don't<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.200> crazy<00:01:28.590> high<00:01:29.100> because

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
don't want to be too crazy high because

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.830 
don't want to be too crazy high because
you<00:01:29.430> might<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.820> start<00:01:30.090> getting<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.360> rotator

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you might get start getting your rotator

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.260 
you might get start getting your rotator
you<00:01:31.829> know<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.759> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> weird

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you know in a in a kind of a weird

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420 
you know in a in a kind of a weird
position<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.810> want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.380> put<00:01:35.159> too<00:01:35.310> much

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
position you want to put too much

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.179 
position you want to put too much
tension<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:35.909> rotator<00:01:36.360> cuff<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> want

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
tension on your rotator cuff so you want

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
tension on your rotator cuff so you want
to<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.490> eye<00:01:38.549> level<00:01:38.880> nice<00:01:39.540> front<00:01:39.900> raise

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to go about eye level nice front raise

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.410 
to go about eye level nice front raise
for<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.439> front<00:01:40.650> delts<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.159> back<00:01:41.340> down

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
for the front delts and then back down
