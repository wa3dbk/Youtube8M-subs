00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
really up here I got up here four-wheel

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.839 
really up here I got up here four-wheel
drive<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.089> was<00:00:27.210> pretty<00:00:27.509> sketchy

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
drive but it was pretty sketchy

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.950 
drive but it was pretty sketchy
especially<00:00:29.849> coming<00:00:30.029> down<00:00:30.300> there's<00:00:30.750> some

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
especially coming down there's some

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.140 
especially coming down there's some
pretty<00:00:31.410> big<00:00:31.560> ruts<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.220> there<00:00:32.400> so<00:00:32.940> we're<00:00:33.030> gonna

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
pretty big ruts in there so we're gonna

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.430 
pretty big ruts in there so we're gonna
cut<00:00:33.330> in<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> new<00:00:33.600> road<00:00:33.810> trying<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
cut in a new road trying to take out a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.069 
cut in a new road trying to take out a
lot<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.860> slope<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.870> heavy

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
lot of slope so we can get the heavy

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
lot of slope so we can get the heavy
equipment<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:37.980> far<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.309> drilling

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
equipment up that are far as drilling

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.350

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
see that but this is the road power line

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
see that but this is the road power line
road<00:00:49.680> did<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.609> it's<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.879> well

road did you can see it's very well

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.580 
road did you can see it's very well
taken<00:00:51.960> care<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
taken care of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.310 
taken care of
think<00:00:53.340> thankfully<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.359> redid<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.019> whole

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
think thankfully they redid this whole

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
think thankfully they redid this whole
thing<00:00:55.620> after<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> bought<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> property

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thing after I bought the property

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
thing after I bought the property
otherwise<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> major<00:00:58.469> major

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
otherwise I was gonna have a major major

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.779 
otherwise I was gonna have a major major
project<00:00:59.269> but<00:01:00.269> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:01.199> far<00:01:01.789> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
project but you can see how far this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.200 
project but you can see how far this
road<00:01:03.149> wraps<00:01:03.780> around<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.559> goes<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:05.210> through

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
road wraps around and goes down through

road wraps around and goes down through
here<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.780> goes<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:07.860> past<00:01:08.369> those

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
here it goes all the way down past those

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
here it goes all the way down past those
power<00:01:08.759> lines<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.500> quite<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
power lines down there so it's quite a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.700 
power lines down there so it's quite a
windy<00:01:11.040> road<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.759> it<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.170> one<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> I

power<00:01:44.490> lines<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> benefits<00:01:45.960> there

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
power lines so one of the benefits there

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.609 
power lines so one of the benefits there
of<00:01:46.670> having<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.880> power<00:01:48.180> line<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.960> advantageous

well<00:02:01.500> here's<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.310> fruits<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:02.939> our<00:02:03.090> labor

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
well here's the fruits of our labor

right here you can see the new road this

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.840 
right here you can see the new road this
is<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.810> utility<00:02:07.649> access<00:02:07.979> road<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.700> left

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
is the utility access road to the left

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.600 
is the utility access road to the left
there<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.380> my<00:02:10.860> new<00:02:11.039> road<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.490> you

compare it to the other video just
before<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.960> quite<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> big<00:02:16.200> difference<00:02:16.590> we

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
before this quite a big difference we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.420 
before this quite a big difference we
moved<00:02:17.100> all

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
moved all

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.319 
moved all
a lot<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> dirt<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:19.590> added<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.159> 60<00:02:20.790> tons<00:02:21.120> of

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
a lot of dirt we added about 60 tons of

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.630 
a lot of dirt we added about 60 tons of
rock<00:02:21.629> right<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.040> you'll<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.280> more

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
rock right there and you'll see more

I'll take you up to the corner here

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.569 
I'll take you up to the corner here
where<00:02:25.349> we<00:02:25.469> did<00:02:25.620> some<00:02:25.829> more<00:02:25.980> work<00:02:26.129> so<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> can

where we did some more work so you can

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.020 
where we did some more work so you can
check<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.819> out<00:02:30.530> now<00:02:31.530> here's<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.519> top<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.969> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
check that out now here's the top of the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.339 
check that out now here's the top of the
road<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:35.099> will<00:02:35.310> walk<00:02:35.579> up<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.239> see<00:02:36.480> it's

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
road and I will walk up you can see it's

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.709 
road and I will walk up you can see it's
a<00:02:37.530> lot<00:02:37.769> more<00:02:38.040> space<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:38.639> cleared<00:02:38.909> out<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> lot<00:02:39.420> on

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
a lot more space we cleared out a lot on

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.819 
a lot more space we cleared out a lot on
the<00:02:40.560> corner<00:02:40.829> and<00:02:42.109> understanding<00:02:43.109> you<00:02:43.680> know

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
the corner and understanding you know

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.819 
the corner and understanding you know
when<00:02:44.040> you're<00:02:44.159> going<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:44.670> remote<00:02:45.030> property

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
when you're going on a remote property

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.619 
when you're going on a remote property
to<00:02:46.829> do<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.159> I'm<00:02:47.280> doing<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:48.090> takes<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.450> lot<00:02:48.599> of

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
to do what I'm doing it takes a lot of

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.110 
to do what I'm doing it takes a lot of
work<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.200> mean<00:02:49.379> we're<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.939> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
work I mean we're just this is just the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.690 
work I mean we're just this is just the
road<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:52.379> know<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.560> get<00:02:52.859> in<00:02:53.099> here<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:53.669> can

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
road you know to get in here so we can

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.649 
road you know to get in here so we can
get<00:02:53.939> trucks<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.569> get<00:02:54.689> material<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.439> here<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
get trucks and get material in here and

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.420 
get trucks and get material in here and
you<00:02:57.659> know<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:58.019> able<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.409> get<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.889> out<00:02:58.980> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
you know be able to get in and out and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.280 
you know be able to get in and out and
I'll<00:02:59.939> be<00:02:59.970> honest<00:03:00.329> for<00:03:00.510> me<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.659> have<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.139> come<00:03:01.260> up

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
I'll be honest for me I have to come up

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.599 
I'll be honest for me I have to come up
in<00:03:01.560> Port<00:03:01.769> Royal<00:03:01.889> Drive

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
in Port Royal Drive

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.220 
in Port Royal Drive
I<00:03:02.639> pretty<00:03:03.239> much<00:03:03.329> think<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:03.989> four-wheel

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
I pretty much think it's four-wheel

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.520 
I pretty much think it's four-wheel
drive<00:03:04.849> for<00:03:05.849> anyone<00:03:06.719> coming<00:03:07.019> up<00:03:07.139> here<00:03:07.319> you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
drive for anyone coming up here you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.409 
drive for anyone coming up here you
could<00:03:07.650> probably<00:03:07.950> finagle<00:03:08.669> it<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.939> two-wheel

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
could probably finagle it in two-wheel

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.289 
could probably finagle it in two-wheel
drive<00:03:09.769> but<00:03:10.769> you'd<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.579> lucky<00:03:11.730> here<00:03:12.120> you're

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
drive but you'd be lucky here you're

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.449 
drive but you'd be lucky here you're
probably<00:03:12.480> gonna<00:03:12.780> get<00:03:12.959> stuck<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:14.189> see

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
probably gonna get stuck you can see

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.369 
probably gonna get stuck you can see
this<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.480> corner<00:03:15.870> where<00:03:16.049> do<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.200> turn

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
this is a the corner where do you turn

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.679 
this is a the corner where do you turn
so<00:03:16.620> we<00:03:16.709> made<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:16.889> really<00:03:17.250> wide<00:03:17.700> corner<00:03:18.239> I'll<00:03:18.389> try

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
so we made a really wide corner I'll try

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.500 
so we made a really wide corner I'll try
and<00:03:18.840> show<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.639> make<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.819> turn<00:03:21.180> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
and show you so you can make a turn and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.710 
and show you so you can make a turn and
then<00:03:22.290> cut<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.129> switchback<00:03:23.699> right<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.329> I'll

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
then cut a switchback right and I'll

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.430 
then cut a switchback right and I'll
show<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.989> where<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.379> whole<00:03:25.560> road<00:03:25.889> was<00:03:27.440> this

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
show you where the whole road was this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.379 
show you where the whole road was this
is<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.799> cliff<00:03:29.099> right<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:29.639> this<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:29.940> how<00:03:30.090> much

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
is the cliff right here this is how much

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.080 
is the cliff right here this is how much
we<00:03:30.599> cut<00:03:30.840> out<00:03:31.109> of<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.310> hill<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:32.760> took<00:03:32.909> out

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
we cut out of this hill we took out

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.289 
we cut out of this hill we took out
probably<00:03:33.629> about<00:03:33.720> 10<00:03:34.229> to<00:03:34.349> 12<00:03:34.620> feet<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:35.129> slope<00:03:36.030> on

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
probably about 10 to 12 feet of slope on

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.899 
probably about 10 to 12 feet of slope on
this<00:03:36.479> total<00:03:36.810> road<00:03:37.139> on<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.500> way<00:03:37.530> up<00:03:37.829> but<00:03:38.699> that's

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
this total road on the way up but that's

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.500
