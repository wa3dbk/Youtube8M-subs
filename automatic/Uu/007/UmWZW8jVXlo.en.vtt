interior itself would probably be the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.660 
interior itself would probably be the
infotainment<00:00:20.170> system<00:00:20.650> it's<00:00:21.250> something<00:00:21.550> that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
infotainment system it's something that

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.640 
infotainment system it's something that
you<00:00:21.730> normally<00:00:21.849> see<00:00:22.300> in<00:00:22.570> your<00:00:22.779> home<00:00:22.990> but<00:00:23.529> we

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
brought that kind of technology into the

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.939 
brought that kind of technology into the
vehicle<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:26.199> we<00:00:26.349> felt<00:00:26.589> that<00:00:26.650> it<00:00:26.859> was

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
vehicle and we felt that it was

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.409 
vehicle and we felt that it was
important<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.339> kind<00:00:27.490> of<00:00:27.580> have<00:00:27.789> that<00:00:27.820> sensation

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419

we started this program we really wanted

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.160 
we started this program we really wanted
to<00:01:02.410> focus<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.490> cluster<00:01:03.730> itself<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.900> very

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
to focus on the cluster itself is a very

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.650 
to focus on the cluster itself is a very
clean<00:01:05.530> design<00:01:05.979> our<00:01:06.280> influences<00:01:07.150> were<00:01:07.299> really

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
clean design our influences were really

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.110 
clean design our influences were really
on<00:01:07.870> wrist<00:01:08.230> watches<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.760> middle<00:01:10.000> of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
on wrist watches but in the middle of

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.060 
we started the program we really wanted
to<00:01:46.540> try<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.780> maximize<00:01:47.020> storage<00:01:47.560> with<00:01:47.950> this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
to try to maximize storage with this

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.070 
to try to maximize storage with this
interior<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.210> when<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.390> look<00:01:49.570> at<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.780> doors

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
interior so when you look at the doors

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.719 
interior so when you look at the doors
themselves<00:01:50.320> you'll<00:01:50.799> notice<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.159> map<00:01:51.340> pocket

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
themselves you'll notice a map pocket

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.880 
themselves you'll notice a map pocket
down<00:01:51.909> below<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.659> also<00:01:52.810> have<00:01:53.080> storage<00:01:53.409> under

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
down below you also have storage under

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.680 
down below you also have storage under
the<00:01:53.979> armrest<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.490> allows<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.909> put<00:01:55.180> loose

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
the armrest that allows you to put loose

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.110 
the armrest that allows you to put loose
change<00:01:56.110> an<00:01:56.380> umbrella<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.400> pool<00:01:57.580> cup<00:01:57.790> itself

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
change an umbrella the pool cup itself

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.200 
change an umbrella the pool cup itself
can<00:01:58.510> work<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:58.990> storage<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.460> again<00:02:00.820> utilizing

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
can work as storage so again utilizing

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.750 
can work as storage so again utilizing
space<00:02:01.810> if<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.740> look<00:02:02.890> at<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.130> council<00:02:03.549> to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
space if you look at the council to
