new rate i believe and it is a sleeper
stimulant<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.050> believe<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.440> called<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
stimulant i believe it's called that and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
stimulant i believe it's called that and
that<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.700> weapon<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.930> could<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.320> either

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that is the weapon this could go either

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
that is the weapon this could go either
way<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.160> opinion<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
way in my opinion it could be a good and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
way in my opinion it could be a good and
bad<00:00:54.719> thing<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.550> opinion<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
bad thing at it because in my opinion is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
bad thing at it because in my opinion is
super<00:00:57.180> simulans<00:00:57.570> me<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
super simulans me one of the one of the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.130 
super simulans me one of the one of the
more<00:00:59.219> powerful<00:00:59.609> weapons<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.570> taking<00:01:00.989> king

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
more powerful weapons in taking king

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
more powerful weapons in taking king
like<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.980> necessarily<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> gala<00:01:02.879> whore<00:01:03.210> gala

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
like not necessarily the gala whore gala

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
like not necessarily the gala whore gala
horn<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.439> maybe<00:01:04.710> something<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.610> its

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
horn but maybe something up to its

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.899 
horn but maybe something up to its
standards<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.320> could<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.220> good<00:01:08.760> idea

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
standards so this could be a good idea

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
standards so this could be a good idea
scattering<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> many<00:01:10.380> pieces<00:01:10.680> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
scattering it with this many pieces so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
scattering it with this many pieces so
it's<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> challenge<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.810> rather

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's actually a challenge to get rather

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
it's actually a challenge to get rather
than<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.860> luck<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.119> actually

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
than just luck because I like actually

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.700 
than just luck because I like actually
going<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.900> doing<00:01:16.170> something<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
going out and doing something and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
going out and doing something and
getting<00:01:16.830> rewarded<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.729> rather<00:01:17.880> than<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
getting rewarded for it rather than just

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
getting rewarded for it rather than just
the<00:01:18.600> killing<00:01:19.530> night<00:01:20.220> falls<00:01:20.460> doing<00:01:20.790> stuff<00:01:21.060> like

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the killing night falls doing stuff like

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
the killing night falls doing stuff like
that<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.689> receiving<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> gala<00:01:22.259> horn<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that and then receiving a gala horn I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
that and then receiving a gala horn I
don't<00:01:22.890> feel<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.220> reward<00:01:23.729> full<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.180> actually

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
don't feel as reward full as actually

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.240 
don't feel as reward full as actually
maybe<00:01:24.810> doing<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.380> 50<00:01:25.740> pieces<00:01:25.979> maybe

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
maybe doing these 50 pieces maybe

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
maybe doing these 50 pieces maybe
getting<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.600> might<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.960> my

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
getting them all that might just be my

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.560 
getting them all that might just be my
opinion<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> could<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> bad<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.240> I'm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
opinion but it could be a bad thing I'm

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
opinion but it could be a bad thing I'm
not<00:01:30.720> sure<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> speculations

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
not sure it's just the speculations

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
not sure it's just the speculations
right<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.470> other<00:01:34.590> thing<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> want

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.440 
taken King a little complicated in my
opinion<00:01:40.920> along<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.460> these<00:01:41.850> 50<00:01:42.210> pieces

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
opinion along with these 50 pieces

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.969 
opinion along with these 50 pieces
because<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> seems<00:01:43.049> complicated<00:01:43.409> these<00:01:43.710> 50

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
because it seems complicated these 50

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.410 
because it seems complicated these 50
pieces<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.729> maybe<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.270> gotta

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
pieces what if it's maybe like you gotta

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.819 
pieces what if it's maybe like you gotta
get<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> other<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.409> can't<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
get one to get the other you can't just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.929 
get one to get the other you can't just
round<00:01:47.009> let<00:01:47.100> me<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.220> around<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.460> find<00:01:47.729> them<00:01:47.850> we

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
round let me go around and find them we

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.639 
round let me go around and find them we
don't<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.240> another<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
don't know another thing is that it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.310 
don't know another thing is that it
could<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:49.920> too<00:01:50.220> complicated<00:01:51.320> discarding

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
could be too complicated discarding

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
could be too complicated discarding
light<00:01:52.530> from<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> levels<00:01:53.369> bringing

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
light from the levels bringing

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.429 
light from the levels bringing
everything<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> 20<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> wit

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
everything back to 20 and then it wit

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
everything back to 20 and then it wit
and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.040> making<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.000> 40<00:01:57.659> again

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and then making your way up to 40 again

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
and then making your way up to 40 again
I<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.070> seems<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> little

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I don't know it just seems a little

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.679 
I don't know it just seems a little
complicated<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.299> they're<00:02:00.450> gonna<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.630> doing

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
complicated what they're gonna be doing

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
complicated what they're gonna be doing
I<00:02:01.140> hope<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.920> complicated<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I hope it's not as complicated as it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
I hope it's not as complicated as it
looks<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.149> call<00:02:03.390> duty<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.899> kills

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
looks just like call duty get kills

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.319 
looks just like call duty get kills
level<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:06.210> really

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
level up I was like that I don't really

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
level up I was like that I don't really
I<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:07.049> them<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> implement<00:02:07.619> something

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
I don't want them to implement something

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
I don't want them to implement something
other<00:02:08.099> than<00:02:08.250> light<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:08.700> maybe<00:02:08.879> something

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
other than light now maybe something

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.660 
other than light now maybe something
different<00:02:09.679> it's<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:10.860> necessarily<00:02:11.340> cold

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
different it's not necessarily cold

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.040 
different it's not necessarily cold
light<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.060> something<00:02:12.420> different<00:02:12.989> they

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
light but something different they

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.790 
light but something different they
implement

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
implement

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
implement
I<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.550> hope<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:15.030> maybe

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
I really just hope it's like maybe

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.630 
I really just hope it's like maybe
getting<00:02:15.570> kills<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.350> doing<00:02:16.650> stuff<00:02:16.890> getting<00:02:17.190> XP

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
getting kills and doing stuff getting XP

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.950 
getting kills and doing stuff getting XP
and<00:02:17.790> that's<00:02:17.910> high<00:02:18.060> level<00:02:18.360> up<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.750> back<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
and that's high level up just back to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.810 
and that's high level up just back to
the<00:02:19.080> old<00:02:19.320> days<00:02:19.500> because<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.400> seems<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> most

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the old days because that seems the most

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.340 
the old days because that seems the most
logical<00:02:21.180> that's<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:21.870> I'm<00:02:21.960> thinking<00:02:22.320> right

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
logical that's what I'm thinking right

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.960 
logical that's what I'm thinking right
now<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.740> what<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.820> what<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
now that's what I see that that's what I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.850 
now that's what I see that that's what I
think<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.630> my<00:02:24.780> opinion<00:02:24.900> believe<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
think it is in my opinion believe a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.200 
think it is in my opinion believe a
comment<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.250> below<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.640> these<00:02:26.850> two<00:02:27.060> things
