allows it pretty much brings back the
quality<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.759> lost<00:01:18.000> during<00:01:18.380> compressing

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
quality that's lost during compressing

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
quality that's lost during compressing
and<00:01:19.560> transferring<00:01:20.070> over<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.030> know

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and transferring over and you know

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
and transferring over and you know
turning<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.960> regular<00:01:22.140> audio<00:01:22.530> into<00:01:22.799> mp3

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
turning you know regular audio into mp3
format<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.110> basically<00:01:25.470> trying<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
format so it's it's basically trying to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.050 
format so it's it's basically trying to
be<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:27.200> sonos<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.439> software<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
be a sonos of software so it kind of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
be a sonos of software so it kind of
gives<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> good<00:01:30.960> high<00:01:31.200> quality<00:01:31.229> hifi<00:01:32.130> kind

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.219 
gives you a good high quality hifi kind
of<00:01:32.610> sound<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.689> most<00:01:33.810> part<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.110> works

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
of sound and for the most part it works

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.380 
of sound and for the most part it works
pretty<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:35.970> back<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
pretty well it's we go back to the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.140 
pretty well it's we go back to the
settings<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.530> actual<00:01:38.040> live<00:01:38.250> stage<00:01:38.670> which

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
settings the actual live stage which

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
settings the actual live stage which
only<00:01:39.329> works<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.720> headphones<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:41.040> pretty

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
only works in headphones it's pretty

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.660 
only works in headphones it's pretty
interesting<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> gives<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:43.549> not<00:01:44.549> an

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
interesting it kind of gives you not an

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850 
interesting it kind of gives you not an
acoustic<00:01:45.210> effect<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.720> kind<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
acoustic effect but kind of it's kind of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.249 
acoustic effect but kind of it's kind of
like<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> reverb<00:01:47.460> where<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.119> sounds<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.810> your

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
like a reverb where it sounds like your

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.950 
like a reverb where it sounds like your
listen<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> perform<00:01:50.399> live<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.750> kind

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
listen to it perform live if that kind

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.350 
listen to it perform live if that kind
of<00:01:52.079> makes<00:01:52.229> any<00:01:52.439> sense<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.280> mean<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
of makes any sense so I mean for the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.899 
of makes any sense so I mean for the
most<00:01:54.509> part<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.930> works<00:01:55.110> ok<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.369> um<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.850> think

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
most part that works ok but um I think

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.459 
most part that works ok but um I think
clarify<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.320> where<00:01:58.590> the

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
clarify is really really where the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.810 
clarify is really really where the
potential<00:02:01.469> lever<00:02:01.649> everything<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.869> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
potential lever everything of this is so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.190 
potential lever everything of this is so
instead<00:02:05.820> clarify<00:02:06.360> sounds<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:06.990> good<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
instead clarify sounds pretty good I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.830 
instead clarify sounds pretty good I
just<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.280> hate<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> fragmentation<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just I just hate the fragmentation of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500 
just I just hate the fragmentation of
this<00:02:10.739> being<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.190> separate<00:02:11.610> device<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.300> kind

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
this being a separate device and I kind

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.710 
this being a separate device and I kind
of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680 
of

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920

now<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.870> been<00:03:34.320> available<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.070> know<00:03:35.430> this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
now it's been available so you know this

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.160 
now it's been available so you know this
will<00:03:35.940> probably<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.300> for<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.660> select<00:03:36.959> few<00:03:37.019> people

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
will probably go for a select few people

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.590 
will probably go for a select few people
so<00:03:37.709> i'm<00:03:37.769> not<00:03:37.920> sure<00:03:37.980> i<00:03:38.160> don't<00:03:38.280> work<00:03:38.550> out<00:03:38.730> i

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
so i'm not sure i don't work out i

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.660 
so i'm not sure i don't work out i

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
actually gives this Abby I mean

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.570

essentially<00:03:42.360> it's<00:03:42.660> kind<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.019> same<00:03:43.080> device

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
essentially it's kind of the same device

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.740 
essentially it's kind of the same device
when<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.670> read<00:03:44.880> when<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.150> hear<00:03:45.330> about<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.690> you

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
when you read when you hear about it you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.259 
when you read when you hear about it you
kind<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:45.989> think<00:03:46.110> okay<00:03:46.519> what's<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.700> easy<00:03:48.000> thing

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
kind of think okay what's the easy thing

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.880 
kind of think okay what's the easy thing
one<00:03:48.510> or<00:03:48.600> two<00:03:48.690> things<00:03:48.720> what's<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.470> difference

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
one or two things what's the difference

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.210 
one or two things what's the difference
or<00:03:50.070> why<00:03:50.580> does<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.910> exist<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:52.220> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
or why does this exist so the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.370 
or why does this exist so the
differences<00:03:53.640> are<00:03:53.760> cool<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.959> gotta

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
differences are cool you know you gotta

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.050 
differences are cool you know you gotta
pay<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> 30-dollar<00:03:56.040> premium<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.700> it's<00:03:56.790> only<00:03:56.940> a

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
pay a 30-dollar premium and it's only a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.800 
pay a 30-dollar premium and it's only a
sprint<00:03:57.810> exclusive<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.790> it's<00:03:59.790> kind<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.299> hard<00:04:00.570> to

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
sprint exclusive so it's kind of hard to

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
them staying in my ear I mean I don't

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.009 
them staying in my ear I mean I don't
have<00:04:13.910> small<00:04:14.910> ears<00:04:15.150> or<00:04:15.450> big<00:04:15.600> years<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.930> guess
