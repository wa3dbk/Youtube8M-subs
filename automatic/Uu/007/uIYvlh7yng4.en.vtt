one week without spending a dollar of

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.859 
one week without spending a dollar of
anything<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.560> card<00:02:02.310> reads<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.719> know

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
march first to march six there will be

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999

no<00:02:08.099> entries<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:08.789> pink<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.720> deposit

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
no entries on my pink the deposit

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220 
no entries on my pink the deposit
and<00:02:11.159> I<00:02:11.849> think<00:02:12.239> it'd<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> pretty<00:02:12.720> fun<00:02:12.989> thing

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and I think it'd be a pretty fun thing

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.289 
and I think it'd be a pretty fun thing
to<00:02:13.260> see<00:02:13.620> how<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.189> if<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.459> actually<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:15.060> get

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
to see how then if we actually can get

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.929 
to see how then if we actually can get
you<00:02:15.629> know<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:16.500> fact<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.980> i<00:02:17.310> mean<00:02:17.340> we're

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
you know the fact is i mean we're

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.640 
you know the fact is i mean we're
actually<00:02:18.060> trying<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.659> no<00:02:18.840> prep<00:02:19.110> time<00:02:19.319> for

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
actually trying to do no prep time for

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.350 
actually trying to do no prep time for
the<00:02:19.860> reason<00:02:20.159> is<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:20.849> we<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.299> of

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the reason is like if we kind of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.670 
the reason is like if we kind of
cheating<00:02:21.659> if<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:21.870> prepped<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.379> we<00:02:22.500> bought

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
cheating if we prepped like we bought

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.710 
cheating if we prepped like we bought
enough<00:02:22.950> food<00:02:23.189> to<00:02:23.220> last<00:02:23.340> us<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:23.760> five<00:02:24.060> days<00:02:24.390> or

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
enough food to last us for five days or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
enough food to last us for five days or
if<00:02:25.349> we<00:02:25.470> had<00:02:25.650> enough<00:02:25.950> toilet<00:02:26.159> paper<00:02:26.340> without

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
if we had enough toilet paper without

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.470 
if we had enough toilet paper without
checking<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:28.620> cutting<00:02:29.010> ourselves<00:02:29.129> off<00:02:29.579> for

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
checking just cutting ourselves off for

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.399 
checking just cutting ourselves off for
five<00:02:30.690> days<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.799> market<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.290> an

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
five days of the market so that's an

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.869 
five days of the market so that's an
idea<00:02:34.709> I've<00:02:34.829> had<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> I'm<00:02:35.340> gonna<00:02:35.489> try<00:02:35.730> that

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
idea I've had and I'm gonna try that

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.580 
idea I've had and I'm gonna try that
starting<00:02:36.360> march<00:02:36.569> first<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.109> march<00:02:37.379> first

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590

through the fifth I will not be spending
a<00:02:39.959> dollar<00:02:40.819> obviously<00:02:41.819> you're<00:02:42.150> spending<00:02:42.510> money

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599

every day that you breathe obviously the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
every day that you breathe obviously the
water<00:02:44.609> stays<00:02:44.909> on<00:02:45.150> obviously<00:02:45.569> electricity

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
water stays on obviously electricity

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.229 
water stays on obviously electricity
stays<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.620> those<00:02:46.799> are<00:02:46.950> things<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:48.090> know

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
stays on those are things that you know

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.509 
stays on those are things that you know
we're<00:02:49.170> not<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.739> without<00:02:50.040> mainly

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
we're not going to go without mainly

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.089 
we're not going to go without mainly
because<00:02:51.049> that'd<00:02:52.049> be<00:02:52.170> five<00:02:52.349> days<00:02:52.620> without<00:02:52.769> work

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
because that'd be five days without work

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.430 
because that'd be five days without work
and<00:02:53.430> things<00:02:53.609> like<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:55.019> for<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.290> most

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and things like that but for the most

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.930 
and things like that but for the most
part<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.920> figured<00:02:56.579> it'd<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.700> pretty

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
part I figured it'd be pretty

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.610 
part I figured it'd be pretty
