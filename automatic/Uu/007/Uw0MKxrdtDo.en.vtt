00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.560
 this strong package around flies 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.099
 we're already sick and need meat 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.020
 minced I took pork and veal 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.449
 so it is tastier and softer 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.720
 also with pork then stale bread 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:38.390

 it takes abundant cheese the salt and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.040
 the eggs after we have in the past the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.690

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.160
 I squeeze and then I crumble it very well 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.960
 then if a marghera a but I'm already fine 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.059
 with the meat when it has revised 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.309

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:17.979

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.979
 as he thought those almost 103 years 100 g 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.670
 of type I realize the whole 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.090
 the bread with the meat that appeals 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 soft of course it must be ours 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.040
 I think I think of his past possessions 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.579
 I always do a little like a pivot 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.579

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.680

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:52.400
