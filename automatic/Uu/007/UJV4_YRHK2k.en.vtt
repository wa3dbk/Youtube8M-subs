00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.590
 you have to transfer it's like stable but 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.330
 that there is very good today and in this 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.790
 video will teach them how to generate a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.690
 enormous and infinite amount of orbs in 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.140
 which I do not think have a limit 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.750
 Now I show you how you have to do it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 for to generate these orbs well what 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.750
 first thing you have to do is put the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.600
 defender class to take into account 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.400
 that I did not feel so I have not seen I have not 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.100
 tried to do it with another player 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.760
 because I do not think it has generators of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.750
 yes but good these are not us 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.550
 they serve a lot 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 Robert Helvey to teach maybe this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 armor of light yes but right now I tell you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 how and how good we have this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.980
 disintegrate that by killing an enemy with 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.100
 the blow causes a shield to be generated 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 around us 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.070
 and good we have this stability gives us 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.410
 other different skills that is 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.240
 so generate that recharge is very much 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.090
 faster your weapons 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.580
 and that you continue to regenerate your barrier 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.020
 even when they hurt you and so on and we have 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 the gift of light that we are going to 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.190
 use that when they killed common enemy with the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 hit while the armor is activated 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.770
 and an orb is generated that's why he criticized 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.450
 not that there is no limit teo 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.030
 Generated orbs until you 're removing 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.210
 shield obviously 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.010
 because it is not in super in superama se 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.320
 I think it has a limit of 9 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.320
 if you have helmets or armor that give you 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.030
 one more orbs 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.860
 and well I use this one that increases the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.440
 duration of the force barrier if the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 want to use or there are others these do not 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.729
 I see very 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.330
 very useful when you want to generate orbs 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.490
 maybe this one if when you take 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.360
 damage while this bubble is the best and if 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.300
 serve you well this is not not much and then 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.540
 this one in truth does not increase either 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.280
 benefits of barcelos and all that and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.830
 let's go to themselves 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.100
 my states should study what else 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.810
 they need to improve it I use this is 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.140
 no auxiliary plan something like that is called 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.140
 lower 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.290
 increases the duration of the force of 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.290
 his shield it increases the effort 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.990
 and well now he taught them what it is like to be 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.600
 spends when they come here there is 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.830
 true 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.830
 and good shared 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.180
 and for having the 54 hours again 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.590
 but no 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.590
 require 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.010
 d 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.599
 If you want enough, it's enough strength 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 which I have nothing I have more 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.239
 discipline have intellect I have 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.880
 for the barrier but if they can continue 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.490
 generating quite quite important 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.750
 young without worry 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.200
 he taught me that a present of the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 Destinations 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.360
 from metal 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.209
 it's super pretty pretty good 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.829
 they manage to carry that cargo model 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.130
 this thread 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.010
 to the video 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.950
 It is useful 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.820
 I will not use good comes so wanting 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.820
 Blessings 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.639
 since they generate orbs singles idea of 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.490
 super and there are times that you need or can 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.150
 make a mess with super sexy that 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.750
 you fucking want 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.750
 Let's see 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.610
 divide us 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.980
 and a lot
