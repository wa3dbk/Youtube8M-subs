00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
are going to just go ahead and try
setting<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.829> seeing<00:01:35.310> sort<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
setting it up seeing sort of what we

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.999 
setting it up seeing sort of what we
need<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.079> mainly<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.470> simple<00:01:37.979> stuff

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
need to do it's mainly just simple stuff

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
need to do it's mainly just simple stuff
like<00:01:38.280> language<00:01:39.090> country<00:01:39.900> Wi-Fi<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.479> then

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
like language country Wi-Fi and then

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
like language country Wi-Fi and then
once<00:01:43.020> we've<00:01:43.290> gotten<00:01:43.860> through<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.189> sort<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
once we've gotten through that sort of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
once we've gotten through that sort of
stuff<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.119> get<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> more<00:01:45.659> important

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
stuff we do get to the more important

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.090 
stuff we do get to the more important
stuff<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:47.000> enable<00:01:48.000> location<00:01:48.360> services

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
stuff like enable location services

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.310 
stuff like enable location services
which<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.490> track<00:01:50.729> where<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.329> set<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.170> as

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
which can track where you are set up as

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
which can track where you are set up as
a<00:01:52.350> new<00:01:52.500> iPad<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.310> putting<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.149> pile<00:01:54.360> ID

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
a new iPad and then putting in a pile ID

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.740 
a new iPad and then putting in a pile ID
or<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.930> or<00:01:55.170> skipping<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> step<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.219> did

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
or not or skipping the step like I did

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.149 
or not or skipping the step like I did
then<00:01:57.750> terms<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.320> conditions<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.860> will<00:01:59.009> need

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
to agree to and you can either set up a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.370 
to agree to and you can either set up a
passcode<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.280> later<00:02:03.020> choose<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.200> use

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
just amazing and there's a much much

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.530 
just amazing and there's a much much
better<00:02:16.130> screening<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> original<00:02:17.240> iPad

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540

better screening on the original iPad
Mini<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.960> believe<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.440> actually<00:02:18.530> twice<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
Mini I believe it's actually twice the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.410 
Mini I believe it's actually twice the
pixel<00:02:20.180> per<00:02:20.390> inch<00:02:20.500> density<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.580> obviously

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
pixel per inch density but obviously

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.880 
pixel per inch density but obviously
they'll<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.990> more<00:02:24.170> coming<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> review
