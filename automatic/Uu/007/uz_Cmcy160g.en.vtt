00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
2004 for the last two I do in lesson

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
2004 for the last two I do in lesson
take<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> quick<00:01:44.550> look<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> give<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> few

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
take a quick look at it give you a few

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.470 
take a quick look at it give you a few
pointers<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.650> what<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> happening<00:01:47.760> in<00:01:47.940> those

pointers of what is happening in those

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.530 
pointers of what is happening in those
two<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.650> mostly<00:01:49.830> take<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.430> look<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.120> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
two but we mostly take a look at the the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.170 
two but we mostly take a look at the the
beat<00:01:51.690> goes<00:01:51.900> on<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.350> performance<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:53.910> only

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
beat goes on the performance so only

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.100 
beat goes on the performance so only
five<00:01:54.480> chords<00:01:54.900> in<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:56.130> song<00:01:56.160> there<00:01:56.960> emailer

a<00:02:00.430> major<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.120> pretty<00:02:01.740> doable<00:02:02.740> I'd<00:02:03.490> say<00:02:03.729> but

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
a major so pretty doable I'd say but

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.480 
a major so pretty doable I'd say but
throughout<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.080> song<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.590> mostly<00:02:06.100> play

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
throughout the song you mostly play

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.609 
throughout the song you mostly play
those<00:02:06.729> chords<00:02:07.030> as<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.630> power<00:02:07.990> chord<00:02:08.350> shapes

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
those chords as in power chord shapes

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.889 
those chords as in power chord shapes
which<00:02:09.069> are<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.399> free<00:02:09.640> bottom<00:02:10.119> notes<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.539> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
which are the free bottom notes of a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:11.610 
which are the free bottom notes of a
barre<00:02:11.290> chord

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
barre chord

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.580 
barre chord
so<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.520> e<00:02:12.670> actually<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.569> would<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:13.780> B<00:02:14.260> minor

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
so for e actually it would be B minor

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.410 
so for e actually it would be B minor
chord<00:02:14.709> shape<00:02:15.130> actually<00:02:15.520> but<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.820> only<00:02:16.030> play

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
chord shape actually but you only play

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.660

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
show you all those chords and how to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.590 
show you all those chords and how to
lure<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.380> play<00:02:53.560> those<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:54.400> course<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.850> couple<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
lure to play those of course a couple of

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.620 
lure to play those of course a couple of
techniques<00:02:56.220> happening<00:02:57.220> for<00:02:57.670> both<00:02:57.940> hands

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
techniques happening for both hands

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.800 
techniques happening for both hands
actually<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:59.739> there<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.480> damping<00:03:01.480> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
actually because there is damping and
