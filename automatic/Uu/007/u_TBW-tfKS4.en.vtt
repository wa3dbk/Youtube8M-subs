have made amazing progress since the
launch<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.780> 23<00:01:25.409> weeks<00:01:25.439> ago<00:01:25.890> though<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.549> they

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
launch about 23 weeks ago though so they

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.980 
launch about 23 weeks ago though so they
should<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.000> earn<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.390> pretty<00:01:27.540> fast<00:01:27.750> I
