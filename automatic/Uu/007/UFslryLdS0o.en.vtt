00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.580
 maybe one or the other

 activate or trigger 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 but then it usually goes from whole 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.370
 alone 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.159

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.620
 rating force

 this is the task of a cinema in 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.460
 would be my movie heal thyself 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.700
 Of course , first of all 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.020
 successful self-healing methods 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.170

 the so-called questioning techniques 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.960
