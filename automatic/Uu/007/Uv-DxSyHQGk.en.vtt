standard<00:01:29.970> size<00:01:30.890> Swiss<00:01:31.890> Army<00:01:32.280> knife<00:01:34.460> there<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
standard size Swiss Army knife there you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
standard size Swiss Army knife there you
go<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.540> they're<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.439> same

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
go so you can see they're about the same

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
go so you can see they're about the same
size

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.310 

so<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.400> say<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> sleeve<00:01:45.479> board<00:01:45.840> frame

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so what can I say the sleeve board frame

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
so what can I say the sleeve board frame
is<00:01:46.799> literally<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:48.900> takes<00:01:49.140> its<00:01:49.350> name<00:01:49.439> from

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
is literally that it takes its name from

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.219 
is literally that it takes its name from
back<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> day<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.420> had<00:01:51.990> your

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
back in the day when you had your

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.030 
back in the day when you had your
ironing<00:01:52.619> board<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.790> sleeve<00:01:54.150> board<00:01:55.040> kind

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
ironing board and the sleeve board kind

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
ironing board and the sleeve board kind
of<00:01:56.159> had<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> tapered<00:01:56.970> shape<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> frame

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
of had this tapered shape and the frame

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.200 
of had this tapered shape and the frame
I<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> gives<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.580> an<00:01:59.790> awesome<00:02:00.210> looking

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360 
the whole pole right so pretty stiff
pretty<00:04:57.000> stiff<00:04:57.330> clicks<00:04:58.080> open<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:59.310> course

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
pretty stiff clicks open of course

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.280 
pretty stiff clicks open of course
there's<00:04:59.730> a<00:04:59.790> half<00:04:59.970> stop<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.450> there<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:00.990> these

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
there's a half stop in there but these

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.290 
there's a half stop in there but these
and<00:05:01.920> as<00:05:02.070> both<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.310> them<00:05:02.640> sell<00:05:02.880> it's<00:05:03.000> not<00:05:03.150> an

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
and as both of them sell it's not an

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.410 
and as both of them sell it's not an
anomaly<00:05:06.230> pretty<00:05:07.230> easy<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.280> open<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:08.880> would<00:05:09.030> say

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
anomaly pretty easy to open I would say

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.620 
anomaly pretty easy to open I would say
almost<00:05:09.810> like<00:05:10.230> a<00:05:10.260> six<00:05:10.940> but<00:05:11.940> then<00:05:12.060> after<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.390> get

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
almost like a six but then after you get

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.150 
almost like a six but then after you get
to<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:12.870> half<00:05:13.110> stop<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:13.740> pull<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:13.980> out

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
to this half stop and you pull it out

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.909 
to this half stop and you pull it out
all<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.490> way<00:05:14.930> tightens<00:05:15.930> up<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.230> about<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.440> seven

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
all the way tightens up to about a seven

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.770 
all the way tightens up to about a seven
which<00:05:17.700> is<00:05:17.760> great<00:05:19.190> right<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.640> so<00:05:21.000> tightens<00:05:21.600> up

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
which is great right so so tightens up

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.850 
which is great right so so tightens up
on<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.260> second<00:05:22.740> click<00:05:24.200> not<00:05:25.200> quite<00:05:25.440> sure<00:05:25.470> how

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
on that second click not quite sure how

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.080 
on that second click not quite sure how
they<00:05:26.010> achieve<00:05:26.310> that<00:05:26.340> because<00:05:26.700> it's<00:05:26.820> not<00:05:26.940> like

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
they achieve that because it's not like

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.390 
they achieve that because it's not like
this<00:05:27.240> spring<00:05:27.600> can<00:05:27.900> clamp<00:05:28.380> down<00:05:28.620> any<00:05:28.890> harder<00:05:29.280> it

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
this spring can clamp down any harder it

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.550 
this spring can clamp down any harder it
just<00:05:29.669> must<00:05:29.850> be<00:05:29.970> because<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.870> angles<00:05:31.380> they

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
just must be because of the angles they

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.850 
just must be because of the angles they
have<00:05:31.740> on<00:05:31.890> their<00:05:32.040> tank

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.460 

so<00:05:37.610> you<00:05:37.670> may<00:05:38.060> be<00:05:38.120> able<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.540> actually<00:05:38.990> even<00:05:39.200> hear

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
so you may be able to actually even hear

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.470 
so you may be able to actually even hear
that<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.800> see<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.510> pretty<00:05:41.510> easy<00:05:43.450> like<00:05:44.450> it

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
that and see it pretty easy like it

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.340 
that and see it pretty easy like it
snaps<00:05:47.980> anyways<00:05:48.980> just<00:05:49.840> great<00:05:50.840> never<00:05:51.140> seen

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
snaps anyways just great never seen

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.480 
snaps anyways just great never seen
anything<00:05:51.590> like<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.800> in<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.070> slip-joint

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490
