00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 please 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.700
 To change the key in a score we can use other 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.039
 tools we can use the tetouan tool 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.039
 3 / minton in the key with a drawing of our beauty 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.010
 the tool 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.329
 this faculty 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.829
 What is the staff tool with a drawing of a 'treble clef' 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.689
 olarra while selection 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.220
 which is the tool with a drawing an arrow 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 and that allows us to do almost all the operations in this case we are going to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.830
 use the tool 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.760
 selection 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.530
 if we want to change this key of sun for example key of fa it would be enough with 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 barbot a right on the key 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.269
 choose the happy definition option and congratulate the definition of the key 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.480
 and we get the option the change window declared 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.740
 in this key change window we have keys to select the one that 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.250
 they go from the key of sun keys of the new 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.320
 foa third gate fan 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.140
 tablature keys bass percussion keys even without class b common in this 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.980
 case 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.780
 if we want to select the head 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.040
 'we would use click on the key that is we want and we would directly give it 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.120
 okay 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.330
 to the lens and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 the program changes the key in the whole score 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.850
 if we want to make a key change in an intermediate measure that does not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.970
 be from the beginning of line for example the measure 3 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.050
 we should right button 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.940
 inside the compass 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.110
 i would choose the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.170
 the supreme key 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 here we could take for example a changed in third 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.250
 we would have other options within this window 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.540
 On the one hand we have the option to show the key 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 that we have the option to select when necessary 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.090
 never 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.480
 Or always 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.540
 in dation of always we also have the option to change the size d of 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.360
 visualization of the key 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.580
 we are going to leave it when necessary 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.390
 and then we also have the option to tell the program 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.450
 enke compases we want to make 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.959
 in creation of measures we want to make the change declared for example we can 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 select from being counted 3 6 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.899
 or from measure 3 to the end of the piece 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.749
 podés of measure 3 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 until the next truck 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.889
 then finally it gives us an option who tells us if we want to place 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.269
 i the key 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.369
 behind d 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.719
 all right of the dividing line 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.429
 ahead of the German of the dividing line 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.429
 of the compass and we will leave it 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.990
 ahead of the dividing line 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.669
 when we give to the one who today 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.409
 the computer we are going to make the change 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.459
 year in third and we put it 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.409
 just ahead of the lic 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.439
 If this key change we want to make it 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.459
 p in a region as in the other tools just select 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.539
 the region by clicking 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:07.289
 from the first compass of the region and consists the last measure of the 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:08.159
 region 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.479
 yasky 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.859
 we would give him right button 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.049
 and here we can catch 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:15.900
 the kind of 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.749
 with declaré that we want for example a key 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.019
 p percussion 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.359
 already by default the same program tells us that the region of measures is going to be 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.079
 from 5 to 7 the waiter that there is and then we change the password from five to 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.510
 the 7 and then return and be for sale peter 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.649
 suppose 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.299
 what we want to do 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.239
 a key change but 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.939
 in the middle of a compass 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.039
 parce the key change half a beat the best way is 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.549
 select only 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.039
 tel fragment of compass that we believe can be this half 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.589
 or it can be a room 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.629
 it can not be any 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.019
 suppose I want to make a key change 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.330
 exclusively 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.780
 in this part that would be more or less from the second part of the compass 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.769
 so far 13 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.879
 we give right button in the selection we select key and for example if 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.669
 I put here the key of the sun 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.809
 although it tells us that it is from measure 10 to measure 10 what it is going to do to us 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:18.819
 3 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.239
 a change of password 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.990
 inside the same compass 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.780
 if we wanted to prevent the position of these percent of these 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.550
 keys 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.040
 we would need to select the tool 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.099
 class you sorry is the key 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.830
 when we select the resale click between the studio we see some 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.689
 small selection squares in each of the keys and these boxes 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.150
 of selection will allow us to move the key where we want
