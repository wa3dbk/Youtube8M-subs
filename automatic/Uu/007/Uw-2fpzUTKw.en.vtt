00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.080
 the need is targeted that's what I did 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 insofar as it belongs 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.510
 the national decrees follow 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.410

 the destiny of these two instruments unfortunately he had a flying alibi 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.670
 obviously it's surprising 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.020
 and he is still 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.970
 why not that 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.490
 so to say more 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.240
 welcoming volunteers from 1830 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.810

 the concerto for piano and women's orchestra common another year 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 because it's even collins 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.819
 the number one 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.849

 dan boyle's movie 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:26.569
 the innovative concept 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.170
 often at the piano and thus seize the dry 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.519
 he launches armstrong 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.699
 lack of statistics 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.859
 but they have great composers 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.409
 6 this kind of busy is still not so good 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.909
 betting parties evolves 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.280
 others followed the second part of course of course 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.500
 until the end I'll be there 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.579
 who in the department 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.639
 I spoke very orchestrated ten volumes here they are 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.379
 but since things are being rehabilitated to this difficult 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.180
 only one useful vote 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.889
 and the major grain producers concerned 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.509
 this desire the profession they worked a lot on the board because or 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.459
 thanks to his deputies 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.739
 casillas then as soon as there is a big success in europe that allows these 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.780
 layoffs 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.169
 bartok 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.169
 malignant 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.429
 I forget a lot of course but we would have liked to be in 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.229
 the volume team 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.279
 then 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.339
 the Moroccan striker is a talented player 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.779
 the famous concerto of engines will appear in the collection 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.349
 also the first goal league league 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.549
 ydd 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.209
 so many elements 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.779
 2 fidel 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:57.169
 abhisit threatened to use the search 89 'the author's hometown 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.439
 so I'm sure of what is written in this edition 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.679
 but for only 6th 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.849
 today 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.189
 and then they want 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.310
 why not 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.369
 in l'oréal 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.369
 I was a student admit it's a price 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:20.159
 jean-sébastien allard example what role he settled in early 2013 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.460
 we never found in a final 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.319
 so why not reach expectations 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.580
 thank you 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.949
 very probably sincere it never gave me the alert 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.960
 in any case it is exactly at the same time the monitor 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.689
 my level but it is very important the pledges of donations 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.710
 diawara heinze taiwo l after having 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.590
 then gilles laporte then in july 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.199
 the gigantic 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.689
 from his burial 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.439
 for a contemporary adaptation this is the third part of my approach 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.559
 and it is widely proven south of Damascus 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.559
 which is starting to interest 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.229
 a concerto for the concerto for guitar clientele of bernard algret life 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.620
 of professor paris 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.610
 then the kindness of levis with the concerto that I created in 1997 had 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.749
 marked his liszt sonata 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:24.279
 he is also artistic director for an employee is among those for proof 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.210
 she is gogo 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.059
 there also composer 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.569
 bolloré 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:31.819
 yogo ensures 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:37.639
 who has similarly strangled the piece because the capital the life of sailors alone e 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.639
 children's education 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.249
 uncertain in formula 1 in Bahrain 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:47.490
 TV series3 character pieces 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.569
 for m this year 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.080
 narcissus in an audition to his wife who attends so this one 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.620
 who wrote the story of the filming location of the video 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.199
 the villages 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.379
 all the players who did not deserve 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.809
 already there 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:07.749
 for example 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:09.400
 patrice evra 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.589
 composer activity 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.349
 it's a concept 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.580
 to reduce dubai world debt and what to do 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.449
 and that I have the honor of all ages I do not know exactly when and when 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.059
 but also Russian composers 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.259
 they were interested in this galley 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.330
 I went to Moscow 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.889
 and well I discovered a certain threshold did not come to win and they 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.190
 can see their ambitions a work from 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.819
 such support measures 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.080
 a town 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.119
 to another level before this date if ali 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.749
 Russian means business gerard in the world of art 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.139
 that's what happened the day before and waiting for new elections 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.139
 another of those eco-labels this year where the government 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.499
 still muscovite 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:01.939
 the idea is to say 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:03.689
 but hey that's true 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.689
 to regain freedom in all regions 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.419
 here we are 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.839
 a TV and movie 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:19.039
 did you forget that I had written of the afp parisian composer there was 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.789
 invited they come in minnesota for europe altogether a 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:25.839
 minimum bounds 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.460
 wizzgo or two 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.879
 the player's agent 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:34.839
 through his works and an average specialized bank abi taleb 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:39.269
 there are enough risks like seniors in the baguette for example give the 

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:39.789
 form 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:40.889
 thirty years ago 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.119
 vincent was considered an instrument of minors 

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:45.979
 now with the flourish 2 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:47.819
 it's a rare instrument yesterday 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:49.569
 well this game 

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:50.679
 of this state 

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.740
 I hope this film 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.300
 for the future of the planet and make the public understand who had not everything 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.499
 single country 

00:07:57.499 --> 00:08:00.139
 all those who had participated in the head 

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:01.990
 everything has been adapted to the cinema 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.610
 as a full member 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.319
