00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
make sure it doesn't stick to itself if

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.140 
make sure it doesn't stick to itself if
you<00:02:00.410> do<00:02:00.620> it<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.920> way<00:02:00.980> it's<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.850> little<00:02:01.970> bit

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
you do it this way it's a little bit

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.940 
you do it this way it's a little bit
safer<00:02:03.490> okay<00:02:04.490> now<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:05.600> safe<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.020> handle<00:02:06.200> make

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
safer okay now it's safe to handle make

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.530 
safer okay now it's safe to handle make
sure<00:02:07.130> your<00:02:07.280> hands<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.670> also<00:02:07.850> very<00:02:08.240> clean

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
while doing this now you're gonna set it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.010 
while doing this now you're gonna set it
on<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.940> will<00:02:14.240> have<00:02:14.480> some<00:02:14.660> time<00:02:14.840> to

installing in direct sunlight which you
should<00:02:18.710> not<00:02:18.890> be<00:02:19.040> doing<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:19.940> chose<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.450> take<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
should not be doing we chose to take the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.410 
should not be doing we chose to take the
shield<00:02:21.050> off<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> bite<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.610> can<00:02:22.910> leave<00:02:23.270> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
shield off of the bite you can leave it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.360 
shield off of the bite you can leave it
on<00:02:23.540> there's<00:02:24.140> nothing<00:02:24.470> wrong<00:02:24.800> with<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.040> but

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
on there's nothing wrong with that but

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.420 
on there's nothing wrong with that but
you<00:02:25.490> will<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.120> remove<00:02:26.390> your<00:02:26.570> hardware

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you will have to remove your hardware

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.860 
you will have to remove your hardware
now<00:02:28.430> also<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:29.090> notice<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:29.690> left

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
now also to you notice that we left

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.800 
now also to you notice that we left
these<00:02:30.080> black<00:02:30.500> rubber<00:02:30.860> grommets<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:32.600> is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
these black rubber grommets in this is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.170 
these black rubber grommets in this is
so<00:02:32.959> it's<00:02:33.170> easier<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.560> us<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.830> line<00:02:34.220> up<00:02:34.400> if<00:02:34.850> all

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so it's easier for us to line up if all

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.850 
so it's easier for us to line up if all
of<00:02:35.330> these<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.690> holes<00:02:35.990> are<00:02:36.380> lining<00:02:36.620> up

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
of these little holes are lining up

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.650 
of these little holes are lining up
correctly<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.850> will<00:02:38.000> know<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.480> whole

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
correctly you will know that the whole

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.780 
correctly you will know that the whole
shield<00:02:39.050> will<00:02:39.440> line<00:02:39.680> up<00:02:39.709> correctly<00:02:40.040> once<00:02:40.550> it's

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
shield will line up correctly once it's

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.970 
shield will line up correctly once it's
on<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.230> we're<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.350> gonna<00:02:42.530> take<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> few

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
on there so we're just gonna take a few

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.190 
on there so we're just gonna take a few
moments<00:02:43.160> here<00:02:43.640> make<00:02:44.090> sure<00:02:44.270> we<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.020> how<00:02:45.140> we

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
moments here make sure we have it how we

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800 
moments here make sure we have it how we
want<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.620> try<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> get<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.520> nice<00:02:46.760> even<00:02:47.060> gap<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
want it try to get a nice even gap the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.050 
want it try to get a nice even gap the
whole<00:02:47.990> way<00:02:48.140> around<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:49.190> shield<00:02:49.490> here<00:02:49.790> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
whole way around the shield here it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.420 
whole way around the shield here it
should<00:02:50.300> not<00:02:50.480> be<00:02:50.720> directly<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.440> edge<00:02:51.650> you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
should not be directly to edge you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.400 
should not be directly to edge you
should<00:02:52.610> have<00:02:52.820> probably<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.480> sixteenth<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.290> an

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
should have probably a sixteenth of an

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.470 
should have probably a sixteenth of an
inch<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:55.100> an<00:02:55.220> eighth<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.640> an<00:02:55.760> inch<00:02:55.850> gap<00:02:56.209> from

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
inch to an eighth of an inch gap from

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.570 
inch to an eighth of an inch gap from
the<00:02:56.540> edge<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.019> shield<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:57.709> that's<00:02:58.310> to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
the edge of the shield in that's to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.570 
the edge of the shield in that's to
ensure<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.120> nothing<00:02:59.330> starts<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.989> peel<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.260> up

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
ensure that nothing starts to peel it up

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.340 
ensure that nothing starts to peel it up
so<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.670> has<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> nice<00:03:02.180> bond<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.019> rolling

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
so it has a nice bond it's not rolling

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.710 
so it has a nice bond it's not rolling
over<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.800> edges<00:03:04.220> or<00:03:04.340> anything<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.850> so

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
over the edges or anything like that so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.380 
over the edges or anything like that so
if<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.019> see<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.500> your<00:03:06.800> space<00:03:07.700> around<00:03:08.150> these

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
if you see that your space around these

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.320 
if you see that your space around these
is<00:03:08.690> pretty<00:03:09.080> even<00:03:09.500> with<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.519> holes<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.209> know

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
is pretty even with the holes you know

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.360 
is pretty even with the holes you know
you're<00:03:11.510> good<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.290> what<00:03:12.830> we're<00:03:13.010> gonna<00:03:13.070> do
