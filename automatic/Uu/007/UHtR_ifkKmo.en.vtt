00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.789 
hey what's going on guys surgery case
here<00:00:01.740> and<00:00:01.890> today's<00:00:02.490> video<00:00:02.959> showcases<00:00:03.959> hallo

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
here and today's video showcases hallo

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.099 
here and today's video showcases hallo
API<00:00:05.160> so<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.730> might<00:00:05.940> be<00:00:05.970> asking<00:00:06.180> yourself<00:00:06.359> what

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
API so you might be asking yourself what

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.629 
API so you might be asking yourself what
exactly<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.740> hallo<00:00:07.980> API

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
exactly is hallo API

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.480 
exactly is hallo API
well<00:00:08.940> hallo<00:00:09.210> API<00:00:09.599> allows<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.980> spawn<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
well hallo API allows you to spawn and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.789 
well hallo API allows you to spawn and
entities<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.240> invisible<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.469> so

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
entities that are invisible and so

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.709 
entities that are invisible and so
obviously<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.250> can't<00:00:14.429> see<00:00:14.639> him<00:00:14.730> but<00:00:15.450> they

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
obviously you can't see him but they

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.810 
obviously you can't see him but they
retain<00:00:16.139> their<00:00:16.320> name<00:00:16.619> tag<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.609> don't

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
retain their name tag and they don't

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
retain their name tag and they don't
move<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.380> useful<00:00:19.830> for<00:00:19.859> let's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
move so this is very useful for let's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.859 
move so this is very useful for let's
say<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.760> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> give<00:00:21.180> directions<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.840> your

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
say you want to give directions on your

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.480 
say you want to give directions on your
server<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.410> want<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> point<00:00:22.890> things<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.310> or

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
server you want to point things out or

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.130 
server you want to point things out or
you<00:00:23.550> want<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> grab<00:00:23.939> people's<00:00:24.240> attention<00:00:24.269> they

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
you want to grab people's attention they

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
you want to grab people's attention they
can<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.439> another<00:00:25.830> text<00:00:26.160> form<00:00:26.400> image<00:00:26.730> form<00:00:27.029> or

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
can be another text form image form or

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
can be another text form image form or
even<00:00:27.390> animation<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.529> let's<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.189> ahead<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
even animation so let's go ahead and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.550 
even animation so let's go ahead and
showcase<00:00:30.240> some<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> features<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> holo

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
showcase some of the features that holo

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.100 
showcase some of the features that holo
API<00:00:31.920> offers<00:00:32.219> let's<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> slash<00:00:33.450> holo<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
API offers let's do a slash holo and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
API offers let's do a slash holo and
then<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.090> that's<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> base<00:00:36.360> class

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
then you can see that's the base class

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.770 
then you can see that's the base class
so<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.899> slash<00:00:37.620> holo<00:00:37.860> help<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.760> allow<00:00:39.210> us<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so this slash holo help will allow us to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
so this slash holo help will allow us to
check<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> available<00:00:40.739> commands<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.550> as

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
check out the available commands so as

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750 
check out the available commands so as
you<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.379> create<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.980> lot<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you can see we can create a lot of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
you can see we can create a lot of
things<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.239> create<00:00:45.450> an<00:00:45.690> image<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:46.200> off

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
things we can create an image first off

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
things we can create an image first off
so<00:00:46.770> let's<00:00:47.039> create<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.629> got

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so let's create one right here you got

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
so let's create one right here you got
to<00:00:48.840> make<00:00:49.200> sure<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> defined<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.129> your

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to make sure you defined it in your

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.900 
to make sure you defined it in your
config<00:00:50.730> dot<00:00:51.090> yml<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.230> over<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.039> I've<00:00:53.489> created

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
config dot yml so over here I've created

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
config dot yml so over here I've created
a<00:00:54.420> an<00:00:54.809> images<00:00:55.620> path<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.399> test<00:00:56.910> test<00:00:57.510> dot<00:00:57.660> PNG

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a an images path so test test dot PNG

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.910 
a an images path so test test dot PNG
and<00:00:58.710> its<00:00:59.190> default<00:00:59.609> height<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.000> set<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> 20<00:01:00.920> now

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and its default height is set to 20 now

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.729 
and its default height is set to 20 now
we<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> course<00:01:03.329> change<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
we can of course change that but you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800 
we can of course change that but you
gotta<00:01:04.890> also<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.369> sure<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.939> put<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
gotta also make sure that you put the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
gotta also make sure that you put the
test<00:01:07.320> two<00:01:07.470> dot<00:01:07.619> PNG<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.729> images<00:01:09.150> folder

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
test two dot PNG in your images folder

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
test two dot PNG in your images folder
so<00:01:10.020> let's<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.560> happens<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.100> such

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so let's see what happens when I do such

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.730 
so let's see what happens when I do such
Paulo<00:01:11.750> create<00:01:12.799> image<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.430> test<00:01:14.909> its

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
Paulo create image and then test its

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.890 
Paulo create image and then test its
test<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> supposed<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> diamond

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
test so this is supposed to be a diamond

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
test so this is supposed to be a diamond
pickaxe<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.159> looks<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.549> funky<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
pickaxe and it looks a little funky so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
pickaxe and it looks a little funky so
let's<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:21.900> ahead<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> increase<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.860> size<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
let's go ahead and increase the size of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.679 
let's go ahead and increase the size of
that<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:24.299> change<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> 240<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.939> slash<00:01:27.210> holo

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that it's change a 240 and do slash holo

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.100 
that it's change a 240 and do slash holo
reload<00:01:28.549> okay<00:01:29.579> formerly<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> minor<00:01:30.750> reload<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
reload okay formerly a minor reload of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.469 
reload okay formerly a minor reload of
all<00:01:31.320> Holograms<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.070> images<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
all Holograms and images so if you can

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
all Holograms and images so if you can
see<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.930> disappeared<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:34.979> back

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
see it's disappeared and now it's back

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.770 
see it's disappeared and now it's back
so<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.450> taken<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> shape<00:01:38.610> might<00:01:39.600> not

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so it's taken more of a shape might not

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.370 
so it's taken more of a shape might not
be<00:01:39.900> big<00:01:40.110> enough<00:01:41.030> let<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.119> bump<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
be big enough let me bump that to I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.240 
be big enough let me bump that to I
don't<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.990> 60<00:01:45.990> I'll<00:01:46.799> show<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
don't know 60 I'll show you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.030 
don't know 60 I'll show you
strings<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> second<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.079> let's<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.860> hollow

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
strings in a second so let's do hollow

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
strings in a second so let's do hollow
reload<00:01:50.369> again<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.030> wait<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.020> guy<00:01:52.259> to
