alright<00:00:15.310> guys<00:00:15.460> here's<00:00:15.760> a<00:00:15.820> little

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
alright guys here's a little

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.940 
alright guys here's a little
demonstration<00:00:16.240> of<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:17.140> original<00:00:17.650> pit

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
demonstration of the original pit

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.460 
demonstration of the original pit
controller<00:00:18.340> that<00:00:19.180> I<00:00:19.210> was<00:00:19.540> using<00:00:19.720> for<00:00:19.900> my

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
controller that I was using for my

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.550 
controller that I was using for my
smoker<00:00:20.890> and<00:00:21.820> what<00:00:22.570> I'm<00:00:22.660> gonna<00:00:22.750> do<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.200> just<00:00:23.439> do

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
smoker and what I'm gonna do is just do

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.560 
smoker and what I'm gonna do is just do
a<00:00:23.590> couple<00:00:23.770> little<00:00:24.010> changes<00:00:24.070> on<00:00:24.730> it<00:00:24.880> putting<00:00:25.510> on

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
a couple little changes on it putting on

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.269 
a couple little changes on it putting on
a<00:00:25.660> new<00:00:25.779> case<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:26.080> things<00:00:26.590> like<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:26.950> because

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
a new case and things like that because

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.409 
a new case and things like that because
I<00:00:27.340> want<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.580> be<00:00:27.640> able<00:00:27.760> to<00:00:27.850> use<00:00:28.029> it<00:00:28.180> for

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
I want to be able to use it for

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.810 
I want to be able to use it for
sous-vide<00:00:28.990> cooking<00:00:29.050> as<00:00:29.500> well<00:00:29.680> however<00:00:30.490> I<00:00:30.790> just

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
sous-vide cooking as well however I just

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.339 
sous-vide cooking as well however I just
thought<00:00:31.210> I'd<00:00:31.300> give<00:00:31.450> a<00:00:31.480> little<00:00:31.630> explanation<00:00:31.900> on

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
thought I'd give a little explanation on

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.790 
thought I'd give a little explanation on
how<00:00:32.380> I<00:00:32.500> have<00:00:32.740> it<00:00:32.829> set<00:00:33.010> up<00:00:33.040> right<00:00:33.280> now<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.680> what

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
how I have it set up right now so what

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.950 
how I have it set up right now so what
we<00:00:35.890> have<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.310> gonna<00:00:36.460> be<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:36.970> basic<00:00:37.720> pit

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
we have is gonna be a basic pit

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.260 
we have is gonna be a basic pit
controller<00:00:38.320> here<00:00:38.710> you<00:00:39.520> have<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.940> current

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
controller here you have the current

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.200 
controller here you have the current
temperature<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:41.079> set<00:00:41.320> temperature<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.250> what

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
temperature the set temperature and what

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.510 
temperature the set temperature and what
I've<00:00:43.300> done<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.899> modified<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.950> little<00:00:45.160> bit<00:00:45.280> so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
I've done is modified it a little bit so

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.570 
I've done is modified it a little bit so
it's<00:00:45.790> running<00:00:46.090> on<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.600> 24<00:00:47.320> volt<00:00:47.620> power<00:00:48.130> supply

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
it's running on a 24 volt power supply

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.630 
it's running on a 24 volt power supply
for<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.090> external<00:00:49.600> power<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.070> fan<00:00:51.430> that

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
for the external power for the fan that

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.070 
for the external power for the fan that
I<00:00:51.700> used<00:00:51.880> to<00:00:52.000> use<00:00:52.120> for<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.420> smoker<00:00:55.080> regular

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
I used to use for the smoker regular

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.970 
I used to use for the smoker regular
thermal<00:00:56.440> coupler<00:00:56.710> right<00:00:56.920> here<00:00:58.740> that's<00:00:59.740> pretty

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
thermal coupler right here that's pretty

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.640 
thermal coupler right here that's pretty
much<00:01:00.130> it<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.640> as<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.270> can<00:01:01.360> see<00:01:01.420> here<00:01:01.990> I<00:01:02.140> just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
much it so as you can see here I just

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.950 
much it so as you can see here I just
have<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.370> voltmeter<00:01:03.610> here<00:01:04.059> what<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.809> does

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
have the the voltmeter here what it does

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.130 
have the the voltmeter here what it does
is<00:01:05.199> produce<00:01:05.379> 24<00:01:06.070> just<00:01:06.310> over<00:01:06.549> 24<00:01:06.850> volts<00:01:07.240> when

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
is produce 24 just over 24 volts when

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.920 
is produce 24 just over 24 volts when
the<00:01:08.380> temperature<00:01:08.860> is<00:01:09.130> lower<00:01:10.060> than<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.689> set

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
the temperature is lower than the set

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.770 
the temperature is lower than the set
temperature<00:01:11.170> here<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:13.090> if<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.329> were<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.509> just

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
temperature here now if I were to just

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.520 
temperature here now if I were to just
hang<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.920> this<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:17.170> can<00:01:17.290> see<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
hang on to this you can see the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.180 
hang on to this you can see the
temperature<00:01:17.950> increasing<00:01:18.700> increasing

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
temperature increasing increasing

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.440 
temperature increasing increasing
getting<00:01:21.190> over<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.960> 78<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.140> now<00:01:23.320> 82<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
getting over that 78 is now 82 and that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.780 
getting over that 78 is now 82 and that
brings<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.290> voltage<00:01:26.650> down<00:01:26.860> turning<00:01:27.370> off<00:01:27.580> the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
brings the voltage down turning off the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.460 
brings the voltage down turning off the
fan<00:01:29.550> now<00:01:30.550> what<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:30.760> will<00:01:31.060> do<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.240> actually

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
fan now what that will do is actually

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.810 
fan now what that will do is actually
stop<00:01:32.850> giving<00:01:33.850> air<00:01:34.120> to<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.390> fire<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:35.820> thus

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
stop giving air to the fire and thus

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.969 
stop giving air to the fire and thus
reducing<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.390> heat<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.930> very<00:01:38.650> simple

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
reducing the heat and it very simple

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.130 
reducing the heat and it very simple
design<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:40.390> makes<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.659> for<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.840> lot

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
design and it makes it for a lot

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.870 
design and it makes it for a lot
steadier<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.740> temperature<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.370> know<00:01:42.700> if<00:01:42.790> I

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
steadier of a temperature you know if I

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.700 
steadier of a temperature you know if I
were<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.120> let<00:01:43.240> go<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.750> now<00:01:43.930> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
were to let go of it now the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.760 
were to let go of it now the
thermocoupler<00:01:45.280> here<00:01:45.990> give<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.020> some<00:01:47.229> time<00:01:47.470> it

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
thermocoupler here give it some time it

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.160 
thermocoupler here give it some time it
will<00:01:47.799> set<00:01:48.070> back<00:01:48.280> down<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.970> we<00:01:49.840> should<00:01:50.049> be

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
will set back down and we should be

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.719 
will set back down and we should be
seeing<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.590> voltmeter<00:01:50.860> go<00:01:51.220> back<00:01:51.400> up<00:01:51.610> to

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
seeing this voltmeter go back up to

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.960 
seeing this voltmeter go back up to
about<00:01:51.820> 24<00:01:52.390> volts

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.460 

so<00:01:58.970> I've<00:01:59.150> taken<00:01:59.330> apart<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.840> original<00:02:00.229> pit

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
so I've taken apart the original pit

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.550 
so I've taken apart the original pit
controller<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.170> necessary

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
controller and all the the necessary

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.490 
controller and all the the necessary
parts<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.979> had<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.700> original<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:06.290> couple

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
parts I had on the original and a couple

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.889 
parts I had on the original and a couple
new<00:02:06.619> things<00:02:06.650> here<00:02:07.100> as<00:02:07.280> well<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.569> gonna<00:02:08.690> be

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
new things here as well this is gonna be

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.479 
new things here as well this is gonna be
the<00:02:09.020> new<00:02:09.170> solid-state<00:02:09.770> relay<00:02:10.160> because<00:02:10.310> I'm

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
the new solid-state relay because I'm

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.920 
the new solid-state relay because I'm
gonna<00:02:10.580> be<00:02:10.670> controlling<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.770> 120<00:02:12.770> volts<00:02:13.010> AC<00:02:13.930> so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
gonna be controlling the 120 volts AC so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.979 
gonna be controlling the 120 volts AC so
we<00:02:15.050> had<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.230> beat<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.530> guy<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.100> little<00:02:16.280> bit

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
we had to beat that guy up a little bit

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.290 
we had to beat that guy up a little bit

things like that so I'll able to cook
sous<00:02:33.410> vide<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:34.970> wanted<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.750> get<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
sous vide now I just wanted to get a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.449 
sous vide now I just wanted to get a
little<00:02:36.200> more<00:02:36.290> room<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.800> box<00:02:37.069> because<00:02:37.250> we

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
little more room in that box because we

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.050 
little more room in that box because we
rule<00:02:38.290> tight<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.530> there<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.340> what<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:40.760> is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
rule tight in there so what I have is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.890 
rule tight in there so what I have is
just<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.420> Tupperware<00:02:41.840> container<00:02:42.230> here<00:02:43.900> very

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
just a Tupperware container here very

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.699 
just a Tupperware container here very
simple<00:02:45.580> nice<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.790> cheap<00:02:46.970> as<00:02:47.150> well<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
simple nice and cheap as well and the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.710 
simple nice and cheap as well and the
first<00:02:48.950> step<00:02:49.160> here<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.670> you're<00:02:50.000> gonna<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.390> to

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
first step here is you're gonna have to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.670 
first step here is you're gonna have to
measure<00:02:51.650> everything<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.760> get<00:02:52.910> an<00:02:53.030> idea<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.690> how

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
measure everything to get an idea of how

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.759 
measure everything to get an idea of how
you<00:02:54.739> want<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.640> placement<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.660> here<00:02:56.870> so

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
you want to get a placement in here so

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:58.930 
you want to get a placement in here so
I've<00:02:57.890> got<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> couple<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.400> ideas<00:02:58.459> whereas

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
I've got a couple of ideas whereas

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.000 
I've got a couple of ideas whereas
thinking<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.360> putting<00:02:59.630> this<00:02:59.780> guy<00:03:00.019> in<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
thinking is putting this guy in here and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.880 
thinking is putting this guy in here and
then<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:05.150> actual<00:03:05.390> plug<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.380> back<00:03:06.560> there

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
then the actual plug in the back there

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.160 
then the actual plug in the back there
now<00:03:07.730> nice<00:03:08.239> thing<00:03:08.420> about<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.720> Tupperware

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
now nice thing about the Tupperware

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.830 
now nice thing about the Tupperware
it's<00:03:09.680> gonna<00:03:09.799> be<00:03:09.980> watertight<00:03:10.310> as<00:03:10.760> well<00:03:11.090> which

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
it's gonna be watertight as well which

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.870 
it's gonna be watertight as well which
is<00:03:11.989> always<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.320> good<00:03:12.500> thing

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
is always a good thing

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.780 
is always a good thing
so<00:03:13.880> measure<00:03:14.480> up<00:03:14.720> where<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.049> want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.650> cut<00:03:16.430> and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
so measure up where you want to cut and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.430 
so measure up where you want to cut and
take<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:17.630> dremel<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.709> case<00:03:18.890> here<00:03:19.280> or

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
take a dremel to the the case here or

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.940 
take a dremel to the the case here or
exacto<00:03:21.440> knife<00:03:21.620> whatever<00:03:21.980> works<00:03:22.220> for<00:03:22.310> you

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
alright guys as you can see I've already

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.650 
alright guys as you can see I've already
made<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.959> cut<00:03:32.260> into<00:03:32.620> my<00:03:33.370> container<00:03:33.670> here<00:03:34.090> I've

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
made you cut into my container here I've

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.740 
made you cut into my container here I've
fitted<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.470> socket<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.970> I've

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
fitted the socket on here and I've

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.380 
fitted the socket on here and I've
already<00:03:37.870> done<00:03:38.050> some<00:03:38.200> wiring<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.099> hot<00:03:40.090> glue

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
already done some wiring and hot glue

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.720 
already done some wiring and hot glue
down<00:03:40.720> my<00:03:41.080> relay<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.830> have<00:03:41.950> an<00:03:42.040> idea<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.370> where

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
down my relay so I have an idea of where

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.509 
down my relay so I have an idea of where
everything's<00:03:43.090> gonna<00:03:43.209> go<00:03:44.130> now<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.310> just<00:03:45.400> a

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
everything's gonna go now it's just a

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.100 
everything's gonna go now it's just a
matter<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.760> doing<00:03:46.000> all<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.630> different<00:03:46.900> wiring

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
matter of doing all the different wiring

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.190 
matter of doing all the different wiring
and<00:03:47.440> testing<00:03:47.800> on<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.099> as<00:03:48.970> far<00:03:49.239> as<00:03:49.420> kinematics

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
and testing on it as far as kinematics

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.690 
and testing on it as far as kinematics
go<00:03:50.849> you're<00:03:51.849> probably<00:03:52.180> better<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:53.170> go<00:03:53.319> on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
go you're probably better just to go on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.220 
go you're probably better just to go on
whatever<00:03:54.700> website<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.180> buy<00:03:55.420> your<00:03:55.630> kid<00:03:55.959> and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
whatever website you buy your kid and

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.850 
whatever website you buy your kid and
your<00:03:57.040> solid<00:03:57.610> state<00:03:57.790> relay<00:03:58.120> from<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:59.319> go<00:03:59.680> buy

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
your solid state relay from and go buy

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.479 
your solid state relay from and go buy
that<00:04:00.989> they<00:04:01.989> probably<00:04:02.530> change<00:04:02.739> model<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.190> model

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
that they probably change model to model

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.039 
that they probably change model to model
so<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.670> don't<00:04:03.850> want<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.060> give<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.299> any<00:04:04.420> improper

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
so I don't want to give you any improper

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.650 
so I don't want to give you any improper
information<00:04:05.290> here<00:04:05.890> but<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:07.360> only<00:04:07.510> other

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
information here but the only other

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.320 
information here but the only other
thing<00:04:07.900> that<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.140> will<00:04:08.560> add<00:04:08.799> later<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:09.970> don't

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
thing that I will add later that I don't

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.140 
thing that I will add later that I don't
have<00:04:10.480> at<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.690> moment<00:04:10.750> would<00:04:11.530> be<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> 15<00:04:12.489> amp<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
have at the moment would be a 15 amp to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.420 
have at the moment would be a 15 amp to
use<00:04:13.299> for<00:04:13.569> this<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.709> way<00:04:14.860> it's<00:04:15.010> all<00:04:15.160> safe

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
use for this so that way it's all safe

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.039 
use for this so that way it's all safe
in<00:04:15.670> case<00:04:15.849> there's<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.150> short<00:04:16.479> or<00:04:16.600> anything<00:04:16.780> in

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
in case there's a short or anything in

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.219 
in case there's a short or anything in
there<00:04:17.229> so<00:04:18.030> all<00:04:19.030> what<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.269> got<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.479> do<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.870> take

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
there so all what I got to do is take

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.600 
there so all what I got to do is take
the<00:04:20.470> kid<00:04:21.810> let's<00:04:22.810> guy<00:04:22.990> here<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.530> start<00:04:24.490> to

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the kid let's guy here and start to

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.290 
the kid let's guy here and start to
water<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:25.030> all<00:04:25.150> up<00:04:25.389> in<00:04:25.630> there<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.410> then<00:04:27.300> it'll

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
water it all up in there and then it'll

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.360 
water it all up in there and then it'll
be<00:04:28.389> all<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:28.690> hopefully<00:04:29.200> do<00:04:29.740> some<00:04:29.770> testing

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
be all is that hopefully do some testing

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.830 
be all is that hopefully do some testing
and<00:04:30.430> then<00:04:30.700> hot<00:04:30.940> glue<00:04:30.970> everything<00:04:31.600> make<00:04:31.810> sure

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
and then hot glue everything make sure

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.180 
and then hot glue everything make sure
it's<00:04:32.110> all<00:04:32.260> sealed<00:04:32.680> nice<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.039> tight

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
it's all sealed nice and tight

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.450 
it's all sealed nice and tight
watertight

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.700 

but<00:04:39.970> here<00:04:40.120> we<00:04:40.210> go<00:04:40.330> let's<00:04:40.600> try<00:04:40.750> connecting<00:04:41.620> this

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
but here we go let's try connecting this

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.939 
but here we go let's try connecting this
up<00:04:41.949> to<00:04:42.160> some<00:04:42.819> electricity<00:04:43.240> here<00:04:43.690> see<00:04:44.560> if<00:04:44.710> any

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
up to some electricity here see if any

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.120 
up to some electricity here see if any
of<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.160> magical<00:04:45.550> sparks<00:04:45.910> come<00:04:46.120> out<00:04:46.889> or<00:04:47.889> if<00:04:47.979> I

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
of the magical sparks come out or if I

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.249 
of the magical sparks come out or if I
actually<00:04:48.310> wired<00:04:48.729> everything<00:04:49.000> correct<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:53.139> as

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
actually wired everything correct so as

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.600 
actually wired everything correct so as
you<00:04:53.380> can<00:04:53.440> see<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.770> pic<00:04:53.919> turned<00:04:54.220> on<00:04:56.220> no<00:04:57.220> smoke

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
you can see the pic turned on no smoke

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.510 
you can see the pic turned on no smoke
everything<00:04:58.150> looks<00:04:58.360> good<00:04:58.800> now<00:04:59.830> what<00:05:00.310> I'm<00:05:00.400> going

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
everything looks good now what I'm going

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.480 
everything looks good now what I'm going
to<00:05:00.550> do<00:05:00.699> is<00:05:01.030> test<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.169> power<00:05:02.710> supply<00:05:03.160> coming

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
to do is test the power supply coming

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.390 
to do is test the power supply coming
out<00:05:03.759> of<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.360> hundred<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:04.900> twenty<00:05:05.080> volt

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
out of the hundred and twenty volt

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.490 
out of the hundred and twenty volt
receptacle<00:05:06.400> there<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:07.349> that's<00:05:08.349> how<00:05:08.440> I

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
receptacle there and that's how I

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.499 
receptacle there and that's how I
connect<00:05:08.949> my<00:05:09.039> smoker<00:05:09.460> through<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:09.940> little<00:05:10.150> RCA

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
connect my smoker through the little RCA

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.140 
connect my smoker through the little RCA
connection<00:05:10.990> up<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.259> front<00:05:11.470> here<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:12.150> what

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
connection up in the front here so what

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.159 
connection up in the front here so what
I'm<00:05:13.240> gonna<00:05:13.330> do<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:13.810> just<00:05:13.870> take<00:05:14.530> my<00:05:14.560> multimeter

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
I'm gonna do is just take my multimeter

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.360 
I'm gonna do is just take my multimeter
positives<00:05:17.169> on<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.410> inside<00:05:17.710> negatives<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.280> the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
positives on the inside negatives on the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:27.240 
positives on the inside negatives on the
out<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:23.470> as<00:05:23.650> we<00:05:23.800> can<00:05:23.889> see<00:05:25.650> really<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.860> coming<00:05:27.130> on

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
out so as we can see really is coming on

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.830 
out so as we can see really is coming on
and<00:05:27.460> off<00:05:27.550> at<00:05:27.820> this<00:05:27.970> temperature<00:05:28.330> it's<00:05:28.630> just

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
and off at this temperature it's just

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.529 
and off at this temperature it's just
how<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.020> pit<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.410> controlled<00:05:29.860> at<00:05:30.009> the<00:05:30.039> moment

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
how the pit is controlled at the moment

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.570 
how the pit is controlled at the moment
it's<00:05:31.539> not<00:05:31.630> actually<00:05:32.050> set<00:05:32.289> up<00:05:32.470> for<00:05:33.070> what<00:05:33.460> we're

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
it's not actually set up for what we're

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.390 
it's not actually set up for what we're
doing<00:05:33.610> here<00:05:34.590> because<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:36.039> have<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.310> go

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
doing here because you have to go

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.370 
doing here because you have to go
through<00:05:36.669> a<00:05:36.699> little<00:05:36.789> diagnostic<00:05:37.509> test<00:05:37.780> and<00:05:38.080> you

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
through a little diagnostic test and you

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.800 
through a little diagnostic test and you
will<00:05:38.470> control<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:38.830> better<00:05:39.479> well<00:05:40.479> let's<00:05:40.599> just

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
will control it better well let's just

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.370 
will control it better well let's just
see<00:05:40.990> if<00:05:41.229> I<00:05:41.620> give<00:05:41.770> it<00:05:41.889> some<00:05:42.009> heat<00:05:43.080> there<00:05:44.080> we<00:05:44.199> go

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
see if I give it some heat there we go

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.430 
see if I give it some heat there we go
it<00:05:44.650> turned<00:05:44.889> off<00:05:46.110> that's<00:05:47.110> all<00:05:47.289> working

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
it turned off that's all working

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.620 
it turned off that's all working
correctly<00:05:47.830> let's<00:05:48.820> see<00:05:48.970> if<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.120> take<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.330> cold

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
correctly let's see if I take a cold

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.360 
correctly let's see if I take a cold
drink

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
drink

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.899 
drink
put<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.550> thermal<00:05:51.880> coupler<00:05:52.240> in<00:05:52.419> there<00:05:52.740> and

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
put that thermal coupler in there and

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.990 
put that thermal coupler in there and
the<00:05:54.909> temperature<00:05:55.270> should<00:05:55.300> start<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.870> drop<00:05:57.000> as

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
the temperature should start to drop as

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.930 
the temperature should start to drop as
it<00:05:58.060> is<00:05:58.469> and<00:05:59.469> immediately<00:06:00.219> as<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:00.550> scents<00:06:00.849> the

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
it is and immediately as it scents the

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.719 
it is and immediately as it scents the
temperature<00:06:01.360> dropping<00:06:01.690> at<00:06:02.289> a<00:06:02.380> rapid<00:06:02.919> rate<00:06:02.949> it

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
temperature dropping at a rapid rate it

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:13.050 
temperature dropping at a rapid rate it
kicks<00:06:04.060> back<00:06:04.150> in<00:06:04.479> that<00:06:04.630> relay

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060
