00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.750
 just obviously fundamental to the king 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.480
 the planer this is a plague of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.450
 stars 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 let's say a red making planer 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 it is important that it has the breadth of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 adjustable mouth this because if we will have 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 a very wide mouth ie fixed design 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.680
 for example set so we go to 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 planing we will raise the bamboo a lot with 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.700
 the risk of chipping it and then it goes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.780
 kept very close by her mother but 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 will have to detect if very little bamboo 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.250
 another thing that is important 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 adjustable and blade depth in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.110
 this case is adjustable with this life 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 circle is screwed the more a blade will come 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260
 out 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:09.960
 this is the blade you can disassemble 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:15.119
 obviously now it will be sharpened first 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:24.360
 to start for spinning are used 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:28.049
 usually water stones are 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.570
 stones that must always be kept at 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.939
 always in the water bath 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 water stone and in this case my a 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:46.549
 two sides this side here is bigger 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 let's say to a great alert thousand 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.470
 this instead for the finish and the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 fine 8,000 granularity and succeeds 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 make a blade that cuts practically 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.920
 like that of a razor to maintain 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.170
 the blade in let's say with the right angle 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.030
 on the water stone 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:16.440
 it takes a guide 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:21.060
 I use this one of the veritas that it was 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.240
 a language and mk2 guides that I think is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.630
 very good to you practically in what 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:33.570
 consists we have this guide on which 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.100
 the blade is positioned the blade comes 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.940
 mass 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.500
 strung this way and we have this 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 a roller that lived to rest on 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.650
 stone and then it is slid into 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.610
 this way and then sharpen the blade in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:57.500
 plus there is a support that comes 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.500
 mounted on the rail in this way here 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:10.800
 which serves to give the right depth 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:14.180
 to the blade to make various angles this 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.180
 I thread it at 30 degrees 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.400
 moving this pawl is possible 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.470
 vary the angles the angle and you can 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.760
 also vary by changing the position of 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.799
 this is precisely by looking at the various colors 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.010
 according to the colors that I am here tells us 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:41.989
 which corner we do yo yo precisely use 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.989
 in the corner of type to singles at 30 degrees 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.590
 therefore before starting we sharpen the 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.079
 blade usually the blade I thread years a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.079
 we cut well we say every 2 streep 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:01.130
 then you put the fix on 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.130
 driving support 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.750
 then we go to put the blade in this 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.940
 so that it is parallel to the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.700
 support 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:26.190
 and then you go to tighten the two screws that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:28.140
 block the hook ok 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:39.320
 in this way we have real 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:39.320
 locked to sharpen at 30 degrees 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:48.510
 then start on the larger side 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.370
 ie side one thousand start to slide 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.930
 gently without pushing if not 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:59.340
 it goes to ruin the stone because anyway 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:03.590
 It is very tender a knife but forget it 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.180
 stone should be rectified from time to time 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.530
 sell identifiers on purpose that me 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:17.880
 I have not otherwise can use 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:19.860
 very fine 2000 grit sandpaper that 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.169
 it is placed on a sheet of paper 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.550
 abundantly wet the sheet of 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.380
 paper is put on a glass and way 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.180
 be perfectly in fc plan you do 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.180
 team over the stone 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.980
 meanwhile check that the work comes 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.440
 well this stone has already been entrusted 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:53.790
 to this ram and has been entrusted enough 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:06:00.030
 a few passes then you turn the stone yes 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:04.080
 passes from the finer side 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.350
 sometimes it is useful to go through this 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.350
 Stone 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.110
 I honestly don't remember the name I am 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.890
 three Japanese caught a carefully 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:17.400
 such moment is practically necessary 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:22.460
 to make the finest stone create 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:25.710
 like a kind of baby food we say 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:31.250
 which helps us to sharpen the blade is 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:33.090
 this that goes to spin the wool you see 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.700
 rectified well because this stone 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:42.540
 keep the jaeger stuck there are not 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.550
 because beautiful plan that created him 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.750
 this kind of white wand that 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.940
 then it is the stone that breaks up and stuff from 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:56.120
 pass to the mother you are always without ever 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:07:00.650
 if you push and if you go to push you 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.650
 create furrows of the stone tender 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.500
 you can see that the blade is entrusted 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:29.560
 because in the st pappetta that being 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:32.000
 white becomes gray we are say 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:42.860
 tiny metal particles that 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:48.949
 will be removed from the blade then we wanted 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:51.529
 from the guide and I go to pass it simple 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:54.289
 never without just pushing 

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:56.750
 in this way by rotating on 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.629
 stone because anyway you create one 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:10.370
 small bib on the other side and so 

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:13.810
 you go in and remove the blade there 

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.810
 will be entrusted
