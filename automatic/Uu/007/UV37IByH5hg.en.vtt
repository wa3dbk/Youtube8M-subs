00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the one touch scanner here and it should

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
the one touch scanner here and it should
load<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:21.930> away<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.670> will<00:01:23.759> pop

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
load it right away and then it will pop

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.469 
load it right away and then it will pop
up<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.299> computer<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:27.299> you'll

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
up on my computer right here and you'll

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
up on my computer right here and you'll
see<00:01:27.740> there<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.920> imported<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> image<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> the

see there it imported the image of the
PDF<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:32.130> example<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.790> also<00:01:32.880> do

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
PDF and then for example we can also do

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.899 
PDF and then for example we can also do
some<00:01:33.420> other<00:01:33.509> things<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.290> simple<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909

our NeatDesk software that it also comes
with<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.829> has<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> tool<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> allows

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
with it actually has a tool that allows

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.020 
with it actually has a tool that allows
you<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.649> OCR<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> imports<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you to OCR it and then it imports and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.609 
you to OCR it and then it imports and
directly<00:01:48.270> syncs<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:48.899> outlook<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
directly syncs with your outlook and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
directly syncs with your outlook and
then<00:01:49.770> I'll<00:01:49.890> show<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.030> one

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
then I'll show you how to do that in one

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
then I'll show you how to do that in one
of<00:01:51.450> our<00:01:51.600> other<00:01:51.750> tutorial<00:01:52.380> YouTube<00:01:52.770> videos<00:01:53.130> so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
of our other tutorial YouTube videos so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
of our other tutorial YouTube videos so
don't<00:01:53.759> worry<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.930> really

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
don't worry about that but it's really

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.819 
don't worry about that but it's really
cool<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.840> would<00:01:57.960> take<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> small<00:01:58.259> something

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
cool so it would take a small something

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
cool so it would take a small something
like<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> kick<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.000> boom<00:02:00.240> there<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
like that kick it out and boom there you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.690 
like that kick it out and boom there you
go<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.409> see<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:01.979> available

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
go and you can see it there available

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.319 
go and you can see it there available
right<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> PDF<00:02:04.969> also<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> want

if you want to do multiple documents and
see<00:02:10.379> how<00:02:10.800> fast<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.370> baby<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.849> move<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> holds

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
see how fast this baby can move it holds

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.650 
see how fast this baby can move it holds
up<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.720> 50<00:02:13.020> sheets<00:02:13.530> at<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> time<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.459> well<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
up to 50 sheets at a time as well as it

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.809 
up to 50 sheets at a time as well as it
can<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:16.110> load<00:02:17.450> close<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:19.650> 30<00:02:20.430> pages

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
can then load close to about 30 pages

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.580 
can then load close to about 30 pages
per<00:02:21.270> minute<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:22.129> 300<00:02:23.129> dpi<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.940> about<00:02:24.510> 50<00:02:25.020> PPF

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
per minute at 300 dpi and about 50 PPF

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.059 
per minute at 300 dpi and about 50 PPF
pages<00:02:26.340> per<00:02:26.489> minute<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.940> 150<00:02:27.750> dpi<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.920> you'll

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
pages per minute at 150 dpi so you'll

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.680 
pages per minute at 150 dpi so you'll
see<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.520> real<00:02:29.730> quick<00:02:30.000> about<00:02:30.239> how<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> can

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
see that real quick about how it can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.009 
see that real quick about how it can
scan<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.470> pretty<00:02:32.340> fast<00:02:32.790> here<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.870> is

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
scan and this pretty fast here this is

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.559 
scan and this pretty fast here this is
actually<00:02:34.379> running<00:02:34.590> at<00:02:34.830> 200<00:02:35.459> dpi<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.390> is

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
actually running at 200 dpi and this is

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.150 
actually running at 200 dpi and this is
about<00:02:36.890> it's<00:02:37.890> about<00:02:38.069> 20<00:02:38.459> pages<00:02:39.950> but<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
about it's about 20 pages but it's a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.699 
about it's about 20 pages but it's a
pretty<00:02:41.400> cool<00:02:41.610> design<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.470> hopefully<00:02:43.470> you
