 the program that is called city 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180
 The first thing we have to do is configure the

 let's go to this section 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.130

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.070
 bezos

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.440
 our eyes 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.460
 the moser 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.140
 is this button here with the little cross 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.850
 and the green circle 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.440
 we shelter we select it and to be able to download the legs we will give in 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.439
 defending 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.760
 or that once they're all in place we can go to the patent section that 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.179
 been from the communal power and csif 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.989
 and we are going to look 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.639
 the program with the application that we want to install in this case I would 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.919
 I commented that the mobile is the jump-off 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.239
 is this for the version 2 points point one of the selected ones palomean 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.009
 you 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.309
 i the continuation we will give you in the district to 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.089
 Sanchez DÃ­az has downloaded 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:33.859
 it's not that we already have everything downloaded and will automatically create each other 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.789
 upon meeting 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.819
 good is going to create one of the applications precisely 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:46.209
 and then we go to the act option to synchronize where the disk was 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.989
 nothing simple in itself 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.189
 we select them as we see here is the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.700
 the local application cache 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.060
 and in the selection both in the master will be sent to Syria cache 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.060
 It is as follows 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.700
 the method of g 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.700
 they do not know it 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:14.869
 i 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.869
 Yes now 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:25.339
 which we select it we pass this side and then we synchronize the pc to 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.519
 the epo 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.849
 there it is and stockpiled 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.069
 once they have copied it they will open it for insua epo 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.890
 while 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.289
 allow moment 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
 then we will know if ours well to the people 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.099
 we doubt peace and well 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.339
 We wait for you to upload it will seem like a mistake for not having connection 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:53.259
 Wifi 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.829
 I use them to visualize or can not tell you why 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.699
 I will not have a way to show them how it is handled but they will be marked 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.159
 an error that can not load or no connection 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.819
 be a little faster 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.749
 because obviously they have nothing to charge 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.159
 then we're going to go to the ages here 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.509
 I do not know what to do 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.509
 we wait for it to end I have 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
 we hope we wait 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.129
 the months he's here 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.689
 one 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.389
 Lets put 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.090
 in room and its impact if they realize kibo appearance so it goes for you 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.430
 we only think that the one above 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.729
 because the fuel that I mentioned that I could install these points point 1 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.879
 because three points of the eighth in the subway 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.509
 is for me a version we select them 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.589
 we are going to give him in minustah and then 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.589
 I already have it in the end I would give the option to install 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.509
 and will only be installed, it will no longer be necessary to download only 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.270
 it goes 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.879
 will be installed 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.460
 once we do that we reboot the alcohol whether it afflicted him to give birth 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.539
 houk get app called now 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.089
 bolton 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:44.509
 remember that it does not affect if we pay our high 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.430
 sanchez 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.430
 already spoke we rebooted and once I turned on 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.029
 we go down denied 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.099
 nothing 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.289
 to say this is an accomplice on his part 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.289
 once it turns on we're going to put 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.710
 a free application 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.039
 that tutorials and repaired things 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.740
 to know how to get the syrup onces 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.369
 and to be able to turn applications off from the itu without having to stop 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.879
 I hope it is understandable victorial in case you do not understand it 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.729
 You can make your comments in 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.869
 there is with whom common point together with 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.259
 and it was a big thank you again to the people who 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.999
 that have already registered 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.409
 there the community grows there 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:36.259
 but what 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.029
 that for everyone it was to your liking 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:40.979
 maicon time 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:44.720
 but well that's all for the moment I hope it serves the 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.039
 the tutorial 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.020
 And until next time
