let's<00:03:58.799> talk<00:03:59.010> about<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.340> suite<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.639> safety

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
let's talk about the suite of safety

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.270 
let's talk about the suite of safety
features<00:04:00.599> of<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:00.989> car<00:04:01.230> offers<00:04:01.439> and<00:04:01.859> it's<00:04:02.069> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
features of this car offers and it's a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.489 
features of this car offers and it's a
lot<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.579> them<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.749> of<00:04:03.780> them<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:03.989> Lane

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:04.499 
lot of them one of them is Lane

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.369 
lot of them one of them is Lane
detection<00:04:04.939> so<00:04:05.939> when<00:04:06.150> some<00:04:06.629> of<00:04:06.719> the<00:04:06.780> cars<00:04:07.019> clear

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
detection so when some of the cars clear

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.470 
detection so when some of the cars clear
out<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.829> will<00:04:08.010> go<00:04:08.159> ahead<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.549> drift<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.269> little

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
out I will go ahead and drift a little

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.349 
out I will go ahead and drift a little
bit<00:04:09.629> into<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.989> other<00:04:10.019> Lane<00:04:10.469> and<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:11.909> will<00:04:12.120> see

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
bit into the other Lane and we will see

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.209 
bit into the other Lane and we will see
what<00:04:12.540> happens<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.560> right<00:04:13.620> we<00:04:13.799> have<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> clear

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
what happens all right we have a clear

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.860 
what happens all right we have a clear
spot<00:04:14.489> right<00:04:14.700> up<00:04:14.849> here<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.659> start

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
spot right up here you can start

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.900 
spot right up here you can start
drifting<00:04:16.079> drifting<00:04:17.840> maybe<00:04:18.840> maybe<00:04:19.669> get<00:04:20.669> back

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
drifting drifting maybe maybe get back

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.180 
drifting drifting maybe maybe get back
in<00:04:21.060> their<00:04:21.180> Lane<00:04:21.389> Jessica<00:04:22.079> what<00:04:22.530> are<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.710> doing

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
in their Lane Jessica what are you doing

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.300 
in their Lane Jessica what are you doing
maybe<00:04:23.820> maybe<00:04:24.180> that's<00:04:24.539> not<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.780> VP's<00:04:25.310> speak

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
maybe maybe that's not the VP's speak

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.180 
maybe maybe that's not the VP's speak
part<00:04:26.690> another<00:04:27.690> safety<00:04:28.020> feature<00:04:28.169> that's<00:04:28.949> kind

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
part another safety feature that's kind

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.029 
part another safety feature that's kind
of<00:04:29.220> cool<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.729> collision<00:04:30.240> prevention<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:31.470> when

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
of cool is collision prevention so when

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.520 
of cool is collision prevention so when
for<00:04:32.520> example<00:04:32.550> we<00:04:33.060> were<00:04:33.180> doing<00:04:33.509> the<00:04:34.020> front<00:04:34.199> shot

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
for example we were doing the front shot

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.870 
for example we were doing the front shot
of<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.830> car<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.250> had<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.490> drive<00:04:35.669> my<00:04:35.849> car

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
of the car and I had to drive my car

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.700 
of the car and I had to drive my car
really<00:04:36.270> close<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.840> car<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.050> front<00:04:37.229> of<00:04:37.590> us

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
really close to the car in front of us

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.469 
really close to the car in front of us
so<00:04:37.949> we<00:04:38.070> can<00:04:38.220> get<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> cool<00:04:38.610> camera<00:04:39.060> angle

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
so we can get the cool camera angle

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.840 
so we can get the cool camera angle
queen<00:04:39.720> sir

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.810 

so<00:04:44.330> basically<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.020> car<00:04:45.230> was<00:04:45.620> pushing<00:04:46.160> back<00:04:46.190> on

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
so basically the car was pushing back on

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.750 
so basically the car was pushing back on
the<00:04:47.210> gas<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:48.020> saying<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:49.010> know<00:04:49.100> stop<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.610> car

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
the gas and saying you know stop the car

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.000 
the gas and saying you know stop the car
and<00:04:49.910> it<00:04:50.000> put<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.990> brakes<00:04:51.230> for<00:04:51.350> me<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:51.830> if

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
and it put on the brakes for me so if

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.860 
and it put on the brakes for me so if
you're<00:04:52.130> driving<00:04:52.310> down<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.640> road<00:04:52.790> and<00:04:53.330> maybe

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
you're driving down the road and maybe

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.180 
you're driving down the road and maybe
you<00:04:54.080> look<00:04:54.230> down<00:04:54.380> you're<00:04:54.680> like<00:04:54.800> I'm<00:04:54.950> through

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
you look down you're like I'm through

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.700 
you look down you're like I'm through
the<00:04:55.280> radio<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.940> somebody<00:04:56.270> comes<00:04:56.690> up<00:04:56.900> really

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
the radio and somebody comes up really

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.670 
the radio and somebody comes up really
soon<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.310> was<00:04:58.460> completely<00:04:58.910> safe<00:04:59.120> by<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.360> way

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
soon that was completely safe by the way

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.770 
soon that was completely safe by the way
then<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.860> car<00:05:01.040> will<00:05:01.330> assist<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.600> stop
