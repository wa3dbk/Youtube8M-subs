and<00:00:32.400> that's<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.090> think<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> thought

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and that's just I think what I thought

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.160 
and that's just I think what I thought
my<00:00:34.350> fate<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.010> guess<00:00:35.609> sometimes<00:00:35.879> I<00:00:36.480> felt

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
my fate was I guess sometimes I felt
like<00:00:37.350> maybe<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.649> wanted<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.039> hair<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
like maybe I wanted more hair with if I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
like maybe I wanted more hair with if I
feel<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> almost<00:00:40.320> wash<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.829> every

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
feel like I have to almost wash it every

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.849 
feel like I have to almost wash it every
day<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> sort<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.359> volumous<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
day to sort of get it volumous and I

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.529 
day to sort of get it volumous and I
remember<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.430> stage<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.090> life<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.420> had

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
remember one stage of my life I had

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
remember one stage of my life I had
short<00:00:45.840> hair<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> had<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> tease<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.120> like

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
short hair and so I had to tease it like

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
short hair and so I had to tease it like
notoriously<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.160> any<00:00:50.340> sort<00:00:50.609> of<00:00:50.699> volume

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
notoriously to get any sort of volume

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.369 
notoriously to get any sort of volume
out<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.690> otherwise<00:00:51.929> it<00:00:52.260> would

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
out of it because otherwise it would

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
out of it because otherwise it would
just<00:00:52.559> stay<00:00:52.769> flat<00:00:53.039> against<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> back<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.179> my

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
just stay flat against the back of my

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
just stay flat against the back of my
head<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.839> it<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.379> very<00:00:55.559> obvious<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
head and it was a very obvious when I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.919 
head and it was a very obvious when I
used<00:00:56.339> like<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> mirror<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.149> sort<00:00:57.359> of<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
used like the mirror to sort of look in

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.479 
used like the mirror to sort of look in
the<00:00:58.019> back<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.530> oh<00:00:58.679> there's<00:00:59.010> nothing<00:00:59.190> there

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the back and go oh there's nothing there

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.009 
the back and go oh there's nothing there
so<00:00:59.670> I'd<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.999> like<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> mousse<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
so I'd have to like get the mousse and

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.169 
so I'd have to like get the mousse and
the<00:01:01.199> hairspray<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> sort<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> tease<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.999> to

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
the hairspray and sort of tease it to

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.929

get<00:01:03.390> them<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:04.440> lift<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:05.460> me<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.760> crown

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
extension was more of an accessory as a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.819 
extension was more of an accessory as a
hair<00:01:08.850> product<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.450> opposed<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.079> necessity

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
hair product as opposed to a necessity

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.460 
hair product as opposed to a necessity
and<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.720> noticed<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.259> it<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and I really noticed that when it the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
and I really noticed that when it the
first<00:01:13.680> day<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.310> wore<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.450> actually

getting changed on the fly to go to an

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
getting changed on the fly to go to an
evening<00:01:17.640> wedding<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.780> remember<00:01:19.079> I'm

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
evening wedding and I remember I'm

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.840

if you sort of yeah just looking for an
extra<00:01:34.799> boost<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.219> not<00:01:35.340> feel<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.880> what

example and you just want to pop it on
it's<00:01:44.820> really<00:01:45.270> easy<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.590> in

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it's really easy to just kind of go in

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.450 
it's really easy to just kind of go in
and<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.070> fly<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.880> only<00:01:47.969> have<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
and on the fly because you only have to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.460 
and on the fly because you only have to
should<00:01:48.640> say<00:01:49.450> every<00:01:49.870> week<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:50.200> you're<00:01:50.290> wearing

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
should say every week if you're wearing

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.050 
should say every week if you're wearing
it<00:01:50.619> every<00:01:50.770> day<00:01:50.799> but<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.159> lot<00:01:51.250> less<00:01:51.430> frequent

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
it every day but a lot less frequent

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.310 
it every day but a lot less frequent
than<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.299> if<00:01:52.450> you're<00:01:52.600> not<00:01:52.720> wearing<00:01:53.049> it<00:01:53.140> every

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
than that if you're not wearing it every

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.530 
than that if you're not wearing it every
day<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.950> think<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.520> quite<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.909> convenient

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
day so I think it's quite a convenient

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.600 
day so I think it's quite a convenient
thing<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.750> be<00:01:55.990> able<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.320> use<00:01:56.530> very<00:01:56.830> much

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
thing to be able to use very much

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.609 
thing to be able to use very much
I<00:01:57.640> recommend<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.360> crown<00:01:58.540> extension<00:01:59.050> it

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
I recommend the crown extension it

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.770 
I recommend the crown extension it
certainly<00:02:00.280> gives<00:02:00.550> you<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.119> guess<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.450> bit<00:02:01.690> of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
certainly gives you I guess a bit of

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.810 
certainly gives you I guess a bit of
that<00:02:01.930> glam<00:02:02.170> feel<00:02:02.560> especially<00:02:02.920> if<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.430> go<00:02:03.640> into

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
that glam feel especially if you go into

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.399 
that glam feel especially if you go into
a<00:02:03.850> big<00:02:04.060> event<00:02:04.180> or<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.720> wanted<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.050> get<00:02:05.140> dressed

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
a big event or you wanted to get dressed

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.010 
a big event or you wanted to get dressed
up<00:02:05.650> for<00:02:05.860> something<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:07.330> kind<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.659> makes<00:02:07.930> you

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
up for something it kind of makes you

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.749 
up for something it kind of makes you
feel<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.350> you've<00:02:08.950> sort<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.190> been<00:02:09.280> Hollywood

but<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.400> can<00:02:51.610> see<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.239> can<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.570> wear

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
but I can see that you can actually wear

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.569 
but I can see that you can actually wear
your<00:02:53.200> hair<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.590> as<00:02:53.920> well<00:02:54.130> you're<00:02:54.280> not<00:02:54.370> just

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
your hair up as well you're not just

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.610 
your hair up as well you're not just
limited<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> having<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.350> can<00:02:56.470> do

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
limited to having it down and you can do

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.080 
limited to having it down and you can do
things<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.070> top<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.910> would

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
things with the top just like you would

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.509 
things with the top just like you would
to<00:02:58.239> any<00:02:58.390> other<00:02:58.630> scalp<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.920> style<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.370> and

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
to any other scalp just style it and

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.400 
to any other scalp just style it and
make<00:03:00.700> it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
make it

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.440 
make it
I<00:03:01.440> also<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.459> fact<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.940> can<00:03:03.120> style

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
I also like the fact that you can style

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.570 
I also like the fact that you can style
it<00:03:03.569> when<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.200> your<00:03:04.500> hair<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.250> can

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
it when it's not on your hair so you can

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.190 
it when it's not on your hair so you can
actually<00:03:05.819> control<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> stalling<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.080> bit

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
actually control the stalling a bit

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.510 
actually control the stalling a bit
better<00:03:07.349> sometimes<00:03:07.830> when<00:03:08.010> you're<00:03:08.160> styling

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
better sometimes when you're styling

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.160 
better sometimes when you're styling
your<00:03:08.640> own<00:03:08.760> hair<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.750> find<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.110> really

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
your own hair you find it's really

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.380 
your own hair you find it's really
tricky<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.650> get<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.400> hairdryer<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.239> all

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
tricky to get the the hairdryer and all

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000 
tricky to get the the hairdryer and all
sort<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.690> food<00:03:12.900> becomes<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> right<00:03:13.739> place

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
sort of food becomes in the right place

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.170 
sort of food becomes in the right place
but<00:03:14.250> when<00:03:14.400> you're<00:03:14.489> actually<00:03:14.700> looking<00:03:14.819> at<00:03:15.090> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
but when you're actually looking at it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.270 
but when you're actually looking at it
and<00:03:15.330> you're<00:03:15.420> dialing<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.890> something<00:03:17.099> else

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and you're dialing it on something else

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.979 
and you're dialing it on something else
you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.790> actually<00:03:17.940> control<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.600> stall<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> lot

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
you can actually control the stall a lot

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.440 
you can actually control the stall a lot
better<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.709> bit<00:03:19.950> easier<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.250> do<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:21.330> was

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
better so it's a bit easier to do it was

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.240 
better so it's a bit easier to do it was
really<00:03:21.480> easy<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.500> straightforward<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
really easy and straightforward in the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.400 
really easy and straightforward in the
process<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:24.840> kind<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.050> fun<00:03:25.230> with

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
process and so it's kind of fun with

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.440 
process and so it's kind of fun with
Andrew<00:03:25.709> picking<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> color<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.000> seeing

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
Andrew picking out the color and seeing

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.170 
Andrew picking out the color and seeing
how<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.720> matched<00:03:27.930> my<00:03:28.350> natural<00:03:29.040> tone<00:03:29.310> as<00:03:29.640> well

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
how it matched my natural tone as well

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
how it matched my natural tone as well
when<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.569> colors<00:03:30.840> came<00:03:31.050> in<00:03:31.200> kind<00:03:31.410> of

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
when the colors came in kind of

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.830 
when the colors came in kind of
reviewing<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.790> product<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.269> cutting<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.690> in

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
reviewing the product and cutting it in

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.660 
reviewing the product and cutting it in
as<00:03:34.080> well<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.100> make<00:03:35.130> sure<00:03:35.370> there<00:03:35.550> wasn't

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
as well just to make sure there wasn't

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.400 
as well just to make sure there wasn't
too<00:03:35.940> much<00:03:36.090> because<00:03:36.330> sometimes<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.019> products

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
too much because sometimes the products

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.870 
too much because sometimes the products
might<00:03:37.590> reveal<00:03:37.920> who<00:03:38.069> don't<00:03:38.370> don't<00:03:38.550> have<00:03:38.700> very

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
might reveal who don't don't have very

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.789 
might reveal who don't don't have very
much<00:03:39.060> hair<00:03:39.299> at<00:03:39.390> all<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.319> making<00:03:40.500> sure

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that it was seamless as opposed to look

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.120 
that it was seamless as opposed to look
