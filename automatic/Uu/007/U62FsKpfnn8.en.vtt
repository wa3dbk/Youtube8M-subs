here inside the reservoir at the bottom

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.939 
here inside the reservoir at the bottom
of<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.350> brass<00:00:49.800> piece<00:00:51.469> every<00:00:52.469> time<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> pump

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
of this brass piece every time I pump

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.860 
of this brass piece every time I pump
the<00:00:53.070> handle<00:00:53.550> water<00:00:53.879> goes<00:00:54.149> back<00:00:54.449> into<00:00:54.690> the

the handle water goes back into the
reservoir<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.149> need<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
reservoir we don't want that we need to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.819 
reservoir we don't want that we need to
build<00:00:57.629> pressure<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> turn

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
build pressure so we're going to turn

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.549 
build pressure so we're going to turn
this<00:00:59.070> knob<00:00:59.430> toward<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> negative<00:01:00.420> side<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this knob toward the negative side just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.450 
this knob toward the negative side just
a<00:01:01.859> little<00:01:01.890> path<00:01:02.399> snug<00:01:03.439> okay<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.739> now<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
a little path snug okay and now the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.359 
a little path snug okay and now the
water<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.970> coming<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> hole<00:01:07.369> okay

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
water is coming out of the hole okay

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.760 
water is coming out of the hole okay
what<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.930> tighten<00:01:10.530> up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
what we're going to do now is tighten up

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
what we're going to do now is tighten up
this<00:01:11.640> fitting<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.650> your<00:01:13.650> water<00:01:14.159> system<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
this fitting on your water system that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.560 
this fitting on your water system that
you<00:01:14.939> need<00:01:15.119> tested<00:01:16.729> last<00:01:17.729> thing<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> do

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you need tested last thing we want to do

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.050 
you need tested last thing we want to do
is<00:01:18.750> lead<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.799> our<00:01:20.060> fancy

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
is lead so we're going to use our fancy

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
is lead so we're going to use our fancy
adjustable<00:01:21.840> wrench<00:01:22.020> wrench<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
adjustable wrench wrench on here and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.490 
adjustable wrench wrench on here and
tighten<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> just

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
tighten it down and we're going to just

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
tighten it down and we're going to just
pump<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> handle<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> start<00:01:27.119> building

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
pump the handle and start building

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.350 
pump the handle and start building
pressure<00:01:28.189> now<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.369> system<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> full<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
pressure now this system is full of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.280 
pressure now this system is full of
water<00:01:30.570> right<00:01:30.810> now<00:01:31.400> from<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> previous<00:01:33.140> video<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
water right now from a previous video I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
water right now from a previous video I
did<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.430> i'm<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> pump<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
did but i'm just going to pump the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
did but i'm just going to pump the
handle<00:01:36.600> until<00:01:36.720> i<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.140> watch<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.770> gauge<00:01:38.100> here

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
handle until i can watch this gauge here

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.359 
handle until i can watch this gauge here
get<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> whatever<00:01:39.509> PSI<00:01:40.020> i<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.009> right

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
get to whatever PSI i want and right

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
get to whatever PSI i want and right
here<00:01:41.610> i'm<00:01:41.820> looking<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.210> above<00:01:42.810> 200<00:01:43.439> PSI

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
here i'm looking right above 200 PSI

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
here i'm looking right above 200 PSI
when<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> pressure<00:01:45.299> i<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.750> I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
when i get to the pressure i want I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.460 
when i get to the pressure i want I'm
going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> lock<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> down<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> half

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.399 

okay<00:01:53.270> everything's<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.509> tight<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
okay everything's good and tight and the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.010 
okay everything's good and tight and the
pressure<00:01:55.680> should<00:01:56.390> stabilize<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> doesn't

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
pressure should stabilize if it doesn't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.859 
pressure should stabilize if it doesn't
stabilize<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:59.280> means<00:01:59.640> one<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.390> fittings

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
stabilize that means one of my fittings

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.010 
stabilize that means one of my fittings
here<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.649> leaking<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.659> that's<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.869> we're

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
here is leaking and that's what we're

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.649 
here is leaking and that's what we're
trying<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.290> test<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.630> a
