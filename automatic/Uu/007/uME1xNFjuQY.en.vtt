where<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> snows<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
where it snows you can see that there to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
where it snows you can see that there to
kind<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.820> need<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> Phat<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.360> makes<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.659> look

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
kind of need a Phat it makes it look

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.109 
kind of need a Phat it makes it look
like<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.140> moving<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> little<00:02:07.469> bit<00:02:07.879> and<00:02:08.879> then

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like it's moving a little bit and then

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
like it's moving a little bit and then
there's<00:02:09.479> dimension<00:02:09.959> plus<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.709> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
there's dimension plus this is kind of a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.490 
there's dimension plus this is kind of a
weird<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:12.270> one<00:02:12.480> would<00:02:12.629> be<00:02:12.660> similar

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
weird one this one would be similar

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.640 
weird one this one would be similar
I<00:02:13.560> guess<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.460> we've<00:02:14.580> got<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:16.230> iOS<00:02:16.620> but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I guess to what we've got on on iOS but

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.870 
I guess to what we've got on on iOS but
we<00:02:16.890> take<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.070> picture<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.490> sort<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> move

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
we take a picture you can sort of move

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.210 
we take a picture you can sort of move
it<00:02:18.000> around<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.960> image<00:02:19.170> will<00:02:19.410> sort<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> move

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
it around the image will sort of move

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.820 
it around the image will sort of move
with<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.900> sort<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.990> looks<00:02:22.230> distorted<00:02:22.590> as

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
with it and sort of looks distorted as

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.380 
with it and sort of looks distorted as
you<00:02:22.920> move<00:02:23.280> around<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.120> a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
you move around and this is not a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
you move around and this is not a
picture<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:25.260> isn't<00:02:25.530> sort<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.710> live<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> can

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
picture this isn't sort of live I can

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.320 
picture this isn't sort of live I can
move<00:02:26.250> these<00:02:26.340> guys<00:02:26.580> try<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> move

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
move these guys try on it because I move

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.660 
move these guys try on it because I move
there<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:30.209> can<00:02:30.330> sort<00:02:30.600> of

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
there but you can see you can sort of

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.610 
there but you can see you can sort of
get<00:02:32.670> around<00:02:33.030> there

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
get around there

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.020 
get around there
it's<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.770> neat<00:02:34.950> trick<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:35.730> know<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:35.880> often

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it's a neat trick I don't know how often

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's a neat trick I don't know how often
I<00:02:36.180> would<00:02:36.209> use<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.500> there<00:02:37.680> these<00:02:37.860> are

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I would use it but it is there these are

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.130 
I would use it but it is there these are
all<00:02:38.010> sort<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.310> built<00:02:38.520> right<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.390> what

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
all sort of built right in to what

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720 
all sort of built right in to what
you've<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.370> camera<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.670> course

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you've got on the camera of course

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.400 
you've got on the camera of course
you've<00:02:42.000> got<00:02:42.030> filters<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.750> frames<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.290> some

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
you've got filters and frames and some

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.260 
you've got filters and frames and some
other<00:02:43.530> cropping<00:02:43.920> stuff<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.820> there's<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.060> lot

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
other cropping stuff but there's a lot

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.210 
other cropping stuff but there's a lot
of<00:02:45.420> neat<00:02:45.570> features<00:02:45.900> sort<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.290> unfocus<00:02:47.070> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
of neat features sort of the unfocus I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.070 
of neat features sort of the unfocus I
think<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.459> one<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> coolest<00:02:48.120> features<00:02:48.209> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
think is one of the coolest features of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840 
think is one of the coolest features of
the<00:02:49.290> duo<00:02:49.470> Cameron<00:02:50.010> might<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.370> reason<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.640> pick

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
the duo Cameron might be reason to pick

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.699 
the duo Cameron might be reason to pick
up<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.300> HTC<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.350> for<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
up the HTC one just for that the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.870 
up the HTC one just for that the
practical<00:02:52.950> applications<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.730> think

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
practical applications of that I think

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.850 
practical applications of that I think
are<00:02:54.150> really<00:02:54.720> significant<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:55.739> do<00:02:55.800> you

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
are really significant so what do you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.800 
are really significant so what do you
guys<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:55.980> duo<00:02:56.640> camera<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.239> reason<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
guys think duo camera a reason to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320 
guys think duo camera a reason to
upgrade<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.800> all-new<00:02:59.160> HTC<00:02:59.340> One<00:03:00.060> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
that enough the selling point is a nice

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.860 
that enough the selling point is a nice
