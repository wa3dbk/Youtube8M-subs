the thing up it's really neat how it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.560 
the thing up it's really neat how it
works<00:02:05.070> I'll<00:02:05.580> try<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> show<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.149> these<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
works I'll try to show you these are the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.169 
works I'll try to show you these are the
best<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.130> but<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.759> lifts<00:02:09.060> up

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
best I can but you can see it lifts up

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
best I can but you can see it lifts up
I'm<00:02:09.360> pushing<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.690> button<00:02:09.989> lifts<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.770> just

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
I'm pushing the button lifts up just

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.699 
I'm pushing the button lifts up just
like<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.720> top<00:02:13.020> comes<00:02:13.320> out<00:02:13.530> not

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
like that and then the top comes out not

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.800 
like that and then the top comes out not
even<00:02:13.739> I'm<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.430> pushing<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> button<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.690> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
even I'm just pushing the button this is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.100 
even I'm just pushing the button this is
all<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> push<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.830> button<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.370> then

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
all at the push of a button and then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.449 
all at the push of a button and then
that<00:02:19.110> will<00:02:19.230> close<00:02:19.470> back<00:02:19.800> down<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:23.250> neat

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that will close back down really neat

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.860 
that will close back down really neat
how<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.880> works<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.420> mean<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:24.720> don't

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
how that works I mean you really don't

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.540 
how that works I mean you really don't
see<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:26.160> any<00:02:26.400> other<00:02:26.610> vehicle<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
see that on any other vehicle and you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.310 
see that on any other vehicle and you
can<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.850> latch<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.600> down<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:31.050> like<00:02:31.260> that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
can just latch it down just like that

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.460 
can just latch it down just like that
and<00:02:31.980> you're<00:02:32.459> ready<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.820> go<00:02:33.320> anyway<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and you're ready to go anyway the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.280 
and you're ready to go anyway the
vehicle<00:02:34.799> has<00:02:34.890> about<00:02:35.180> 83,000<00:02:36.180> miles<00:02:36.330> 83,000

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
vehicle has about 83,000 miles 83,000

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.680 
vehicle has about 83,000 miles 83,000
450<00:02:38.010> miles<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.489> time<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.450> has<00:02:39.540> not

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
450 miles of this time and it has not

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
450 miles of this time and it has not
been<00:02:39.750> through<00:02:40.049> service<00:02:40.410> yet<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:40.980> has<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> low

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
been through service yet so it has a low

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.150 
been through service yet so it has a low
blow<00:02:41.459> tire<00:02:42.299> pressure<00:02:42.510> gauge<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:44.070> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
blow tire pressure gauge on but that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.250 
blow tire pressure gauge on but that
shouldn't<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> problem<00:02:44.610> there<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.750> here<00:02:46.080> we

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
shouldn't be a problem there up here we

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.710 
shouldn't be a problem there up here we
have<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> few<00:02:46.830> more<00:02:47.000> gauges<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.269> can<00:02:48.420> see<00:02:48.600> this

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
have a few more gauges you can see this

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.270 
have a few more gauges you can see this
is<00:02:48.900> your<00:02:49.019> information<00:02:49.500> center<00:02:49.830> toes<00:02:50.100> your

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
is your information center toes your

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.009 
is your information center toes your
distance<00:02:50.670> wimp<00:02:50.940> t<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.269> lot<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.900> other

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
distance wimp t a lot of other

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.340 
distance wimp t a lot of other
information<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:53.310> there<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:53.610> well<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:55.170> is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
information on there as well this is

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.100 
information on there as well this is
your<00:02:55.709> old<00:02:55.980> pressure

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
your old pressure

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.740 
your old pressure
and<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.860> would<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.070> your<00:02:59.220> battery<00:02:59.580> voltage

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and that would be your battery voltage

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.150 
and that would be your battery voltage
and<00:03:00.750> anyway<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.530> bose<00:03:01.740> sound<00:03:02.070> system

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
and anyway you got the bose sound system

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.250 
and anyway you got the bose sound system
actually<00:03:02.580> has<00:03:02.760> an<00:03:02.970> extra<00:03:03.270> speaker<00:03:03.660> behind<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
actually has an extra speaker behind the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.650 
actually has an extra speaker behind the
driver's<00:03:04.710> seat<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.760> actually<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.060> sub<00:03:06.330> woofer

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
driver's seat it's actually a sub woofer

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.330 
driver's seat it's actually a sub woofer
I<00:03:06.720> believe<00:03:07.050> has<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> six<00:03:08.010> disc<00:03:08.220> changer<00:03:08.520> and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
I believe has a six disc changer and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.710 
I believe has a six disc changer and
also<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.760> said<00:03:11.910> automate<00:03:12.180> transmission

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
also like I said automate transmission

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240 
also like I said automate transmission
semi-automatic<00:03:13.620> transmission<00:03:13.680> got<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
semi-automatic transmission got the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.940 
semi-automatic transmission got the
plus/minus<00:03:14.760> capabilities<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
plus/minus capabilities there and

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.110 
plus/minus capabilities there and
there's<00:03:16.950> your<00:03:17.130> climate<00:03:17.460> control<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:17.940> right

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
there's your climate control was right

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.600 
there's your climate control was right
there<00:03:18.330> for<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:19.130> anyway<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.400> steering

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
there for you anyway on the steering

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.250 
there for you anyway on the steering
wheel<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> have<00:03:20.940> your<00:03:21.180> stereo<00:03:21.480> controls<00:03:21.690> got

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
wheel you have your stereo controls got

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.890 
wheel you have your stereo controls got
the<00:03:22.380> cruise<00:03:22.590> control<00:03:22.680> there<00:03:23.100> as<00:03:23.190> well<00:03:23.900> and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
the cruise control there as well and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.050 
the cruise control there as well and
let's<00:03:25.890> say<00:03:26.070> don't<00:03:26.310> leave<00:03:26.430> anything<00:03:26.580> out<00:03:26.820> got

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
let's say don't leave anything out got

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.670 
let's say don't leave anything out got
the<00:03:27.180> remote<00:03:27.330> lots<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> key<00:03:29.030> can't<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.330> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
the remote lots on the key can't see the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.770 
the remote lots on the key can't see the
they<00:03:31.680> faded<00:03:32.160> off<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:33.060> still<00:03:33.240> of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
they faded off but you can still of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.810 
they faded off but you can still of
