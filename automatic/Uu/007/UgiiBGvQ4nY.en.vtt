up<00:03:09.780> what<00:03:10.780> kind<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.110> tires<00:03:11.500> these<00:03:11.800> are<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
up what kind of tires these are the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.430 
up what kind of tires these are the
trend<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.150> rims<00:03:13.360> are<00:03:13.569> really<00:03:13.900> scratched<00:03:14.200> up

so I'm hoping the positive kind of takes

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.910 
so I'm hoping the positive kind of takes
those<00:03:16.660> scratches<00:03:16.959> out<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.530> makes<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.829> little

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
those scratches out and makes a little

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.310 
those scratches out and makes a little
bit<00:03:18.100> better<00:03:18.250> for<00:03:18.549> me<00:03:18.700> but<00:03:19.269> that's<00:03:19.900> one

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
