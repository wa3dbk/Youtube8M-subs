glowing bed of embers and no biochar
production<00:01:16.509> this<00:01:17.320> does<00:01:17.590> mean<00:01:17.800> however<00:01:17.979> we<00:01:18.310> get

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
production this does mean however we get

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.499 
production this does mean however we get
twice<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.790> gas<00:01:19.180> out<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.479> refuel<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:21.790> more

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
twice the gas out of refuel well more

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.580 
twice the gas out of refuel well more
gas<00:01:22.720> means<00:01:23.080> longer<00:01:23.290> cook<00:01:23.560> times<00:01:23.979> or<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:26.409> can

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
gas means longer cook times or we can

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.120 
gas means longer cook times or we can
add<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:27.130> lot<00:01:27.430> more<00:01:27.490> gas<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.380> force<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.680> bigger

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
add a lot more gas and force a bigger
