00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
thing that could have made it better is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.590 
thing that could have made it better is
if<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.290> could<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.620> done<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.730> designer<00:00:42.149> self

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
if we could have done the designer self

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
if we could have done the designer self
but<00:00:44.899> we<00:00:45.899> had<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.500> input<00:00:46.770> into<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
but we had very little input into the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
but we had very little input into the
design<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:48.960> basically<00:00:49.230> had<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.860> what

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
design we basically had to go with what

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.180 
design we basically had to go with what
they<00:00:50.219> sent<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.180> otherwise<00:00:52.140> we've<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.590> more

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they sent to us otherwise we've got more

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
they sent to us otherwise we've got more
creative<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.469> probably<00:00:55.469> give<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
creative with this probably give it a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
creative with this probably give it a
little<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.100> pop<00:00:57.020> but<00:00:58.020> they've<00:00:58.170> gotten

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
little bit more pop but they've gotten

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.889 
little bit more pop but they've gotten
belts<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.250> other<00:00:59.730> belt<00:01:00.030> makers<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> past

belts from other belt makers in the past

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.280 
belts from other belt makers in the past
and<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.129> gemstones<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:03.030> fell<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> such

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and the gemstones have fell out and such

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.490 
and the gemstones have fell out and such
as<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.360> they<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.510> wanting<00:01:06.750> gemstones<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
as that so they got wanting gemstones in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.969 
as that so they got wanting gemstones in
them<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:09.540> basically<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> say

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
them and I basically just like to say

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.300 
them and I basically just like to say
gave<00:01:11.189> us<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> artwork<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.100> fit

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
gave us the artwork but I think the fit

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
gave us the artwork but I think the fit
