00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
slow with this process you know so you

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.819 
slow with this process you know so you
don't<00:03:58.450> get<00:03:58.689> it<00:03:58.870> too<00:03:59.079> thin<00:03:59.409> you<00:03:59.439> don't<00:03:59.650> have

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
so you got to play with the blender here

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.330 
so you got to play with the blender here
a<00:04:29.110> little<00:04:29.229> bit<00:04:29.380> we'll<00:04:29.530> go<00:04:29.560> real<00:04:29.860> slow<00:04:30.160> we'll

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
a little bit we'll go real slow we'll

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.909 
a little bit we'll go real slow we'll
pop<00:04:30.550> out<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:30.910> air<00:04:31.060> bubbles<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.500> we'll<00:04:32.680> hit<00:04:32.770> it

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
pop out the air bubbles and we'll hit it

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:45.649 
pop out the air bubbles and we'll hit it
again<00:04:33.160> on<00:04:33.460> low<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.900> then<00:04:35.020> dripping

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.089 

now<00:04:46.659> see<00:04:46.870> it's<00:04:46.990> nice<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.500> thick<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:47.889> want

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
now see it's nice and thick and I want

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.409 
now see it's nice and thick and I want
to<00:04:48.189> leave<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.490> like<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.759> it<00:04:48.879> should<00:04:49.030> be<00:04:49.210> just

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
to leave it like that it should be just

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.409 
to leave it like that it should be just
nice<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.169> thick<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:50.740> we<00:04:50.860> can<00:04:51.009> spread<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.150> be

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
nice and thick so we can spread it so be

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.089 
nice and thick so we can spread it so be
really<00:04:52.870> careful<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.470> don't<00:04:53.620> get<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.919> too

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
really careful that you don't get it too

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.980 
really careful that you don't get it too
thin<00:04:54.400> you'll<00:04:54.759> have<00:04:54.909> to<00:04:55.030> bring<00:04:55.629> some<00:04:55.840> more

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
thin you'll have to bring some more

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.379 
thin you'll have to bring some more
beans<00:04:56.199> in<00:04:56.469> to<00:04:56.620> thicken<00:04:56.860> it<00:04:57.009> up<00:04:57.159> so<00:04:57.789> just<00:04:58.090> go<00:04:58.240> in

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
beans in to thicken it up so just go in

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.240 
beans in to thicken it up so just go in
stages<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:58.990> did<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.289> pretty<00:04:59.560> good<00:04:59.740> on<00:05:00.039> two

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
stages I did it pretty good on two

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.830 
stages I did it pretty good on two
stages<00:05:00.580> sometimes<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.210> got<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.419> go<00:05:01.479> three<00:05:01.719> or

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
stages sometimes you got to go three or

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.899 
stages sometimes you got to go three or
four<00:05:02.080> bump<00:05:03.069> it<00:05:03.219> up<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.430> little<00:05:03.550> bit<00:05:03.729> it<00:05:03.879> looks

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
four bump it up a little bit it looks

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.640 
four bump it up a little bit it looks
like<00:05:04.330> we<00:05:04.449> just<00:05:04.479> got<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:05.080> though<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:05.319> I<00:05:05.379> want<00:05:05.560> to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
like we just got it though but I want to

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.020 
like we just got it though but I want to
make<00:05:05.770> sure<00:05:05.889> it's<00:05:06.069> nice<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.610> smooth<00:05:06.879> and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
make sure it's nice and smooth and

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.520 
make sure it's nice and smooth and
creamy<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.360> don't<00:05:07.509> want<00:05:07.629> any<00:05:07.780> bean<00:05:08.020> chunks<00:05:08.439> in

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
creamy you don't want any bean chunks in

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.080 
creamy you don't want any bean chunks in
there<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:08.800> want<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.069> make<00:05:09.520> sure<00:05:09.550> that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
there and you want to make sure that

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.149 
there and you want to make sure that
these<00:05:10.270> proteins<00:05:10.780> all<00:05:11.020> get<00:05:11.439> nice<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.830> culture

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
these proteins all get nice and culture

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.890 
these proteins all get nice and culture
eyes<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.669> digestion<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.449> really<00:05:13.719> high

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
eyes so the digestion is really high

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.050 
eyes so the digestion is really high
with<00:05:14.409> the<00:05:14.530> probiotics

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060

going to put that in a jar on the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.469 
going to put that in a jar on the
counter<00:05:34.639> for<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.669> little<00:05:35.850> while<00:05:36.030> I'll<00:05:36.240> make<00:05:36.449> a

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
counter for a little while I'll make a

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.670 
counter for a little while I'll make a
nice<00:05:36.840> big<00:05:37.169> batch<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.650> that<00:05:37.830> here<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:39.680> then

nice big batch of that here and then
I'll<00:05:40.830> let<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.040> culture<00:05:41.490> eyes<00:05:41.639> for<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:41.970> while

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
I'll let it culture eyes for a while

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.760 
I'll let it culture eyes for a while
we'll<00:05:42.389> bust<00:05:42.600> out<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.990> collard<00:05:43.199> greens<00:05:43.590> all

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
when you if you try to eat beans without

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.670 
when you if you try to eat beans without
just<00:06:12.479> you<00:06:12.660> know<00:06:12.840> they're<00:06:13.169> hard<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.500> digest

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
just you know they're hard to digest

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.070 
just you know they're hard to digest
harder<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.580> digest<00:06:14.820> but<00:06:15.300> people<00:06:15.660> really<00:06:15.810> like

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
harder to digest but people really like

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.080 
harder to digest but people really like
them<00:06:16.350> so<00:06:16.530> if<00:06:16.949> you<00:06:17.100> are<00:06:17.340> going<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.669> eat<00:06:17.820> beans

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
them so if you are going to eat beans

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.879 
them so if you are going to eat beans
keep<00:06:18.750> them<00:06:18.870> raw<00:06:19.050> keep<00:06:19.289> them<00:06:19.410> real<00:06:19.590> because<00:06:19.710> the

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
keep them raw keep them real because the

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.550 
keep them raw keep them real because the
proteins<00:06:20.520> are<00:06:20.789> all<00:06:21.120> intact<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.780> amino<00:06:22.110> acids

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
here if you cook them you really do

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.360 
here if you cook them you really do
destroy<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.139> nutritional<00:06:25.710> value<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.310> the

destroy the nutritional value and the

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.580 
destroy the nutritional value and the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
really these cut types of proteins can

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.290 
really these cut types of proteins can
be<00:06:28.710> really<00:06:28.979> really<00:06:29.220> good<00:06:29.430> for<00:06:29.669> growing<00:06:30.060> people

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
be really really good for growing people

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.240 
be really really good for growing people
people<00:06:31.260> that<00:06:31.289> feel<00:06:31.560> like<00:06:31.680> they<00:06:31.860> need<00:06:32.039> more
