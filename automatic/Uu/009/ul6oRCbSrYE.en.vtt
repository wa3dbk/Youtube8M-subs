00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
a lame excuse but at the time I just

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.410 
a lame excuse but at the time I just
wanted<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.770> feel<00:01:14.860> close<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.189> my<00:01:15.430> friend<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.210> I

after<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.360> grew<00:01:19.600> up<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:20.020> realized<00:01:20.590> why<00:01:20.829> I<00:01:20.860> never

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
after I grew up I realized why I never

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.450 
after I grew up I realized why I never
liked<00:01:21.520> this<00:01:21.729> show<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:23.229> one<00:01:23.380> thing<00:01:23.650> I<00:01:23.920> find<00:01:24.310> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
liked this show for one thing I find the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.149 
liked this show for one thing I find the
characters<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:25.119> very<00:01:25.509> weak<00:01:25.780> each<00:01:26.740> one<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.070> them

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
characters be very weak each one of them

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.770 
characters be very weak each one of them
only<00:01:27.280> has<00:01:27.460> one<00:01:27.670> or<00:01:27.729> two<00:01:27.790> traits<00:01:28.240> about<00:01:28.390> them

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
only has one or two traits about them

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.600 
only has one or two traits about them
and<00:01:28.990> those<00:01:29.439> traits<00:01:29.829> get<00:01:29.979> exploited<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.579> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
and those traits get exploited to the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.800 
and those traits get exploited to the
point<00:01:30.939> where<00:01:31.090> they<00:01:31.210> get<00:01:31.390> old

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
point where they get old

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.710 
point where they get old
that's<00:01:32.470> not<00:01:32.710> how<00:01:32.829> characters<00:01:33.340> work<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:34.509> can't

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
that's not how characters work you can't

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.389 
that's not how characters work you can't
just<00:01:34.930> let<00:01:35.079> each<00:01:35.110> character<00:01:35.740> have<00:01:35.920> only<00:01:36.100> one

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
just let each character have only one

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.399 
just let each character have only one

if Angelica is always lying to the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.069 
if Angelica is always lying to the
babies<00:02:16.370> then<00:02:16.969> why<00:02:17.150> do<00:02:17.209> they<00:02:17.329> keep<00:02:17.599> believing

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
babies then why do they keep believing

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.589 
babies then why do they keep believing
everything<00:02:18.469> she<00:02:18.650> says<00:02:19.030> that's<00:02:20.030> one<00:02:20.359> hole

everything she says that's one hole

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.559 
everything she says that's one hole
that's<00:02:20.810> hard<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:21.109> ignore<00:02:21.939> but<00:02:22.939> my<00:02:23.420> overall

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
that's hard to ignore but my overall

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.360 
that's hard to ignore but my overall
reason<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.349> not<00:02:24.530> liking<00:02:24.769> this<00:02:24.980> show<00:02:25.189> is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
reason of not liking this show is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.270 
reason of not liking this show is
because<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:25.849> find<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.629> very<00:02:26.659> very<00:02:28.540> boring<00:02:29.890> yes<00:02:30.890> I

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
because I find it very very boring yes I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.089 
because I find it very very boring yes I
know<00:02:31.549> it's<00:02:31.939> about<00:02:32.209> babies<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.260> then<00:02:33.470> again<00:02:33.620> it

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
know it's about babies but then again it

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.869 
know it's about babies but then again it
makes<00:02:34.579> sense<00:02:34.939> why<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:35.329> would<00:02:35.689> find<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.079> boring<00:02:36.290> I

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
makes sense why I would find it boring I

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.220 
makes sense why I would find it boring I
feel<00:02:37.879> you<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.269> can't<00:02:38.540> make<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:38.870> lives<00:02:39.079> of
