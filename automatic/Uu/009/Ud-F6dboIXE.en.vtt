00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
asking around and a lot of people

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.390 
asking around and a lot of people
actually<00:00:13.710> don't<00:00:13.920> know<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.250> possible

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
actually don't know it's possible

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.490 
actually don't know it's possible
because<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.420> way<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.199> kind<00:00:16.440> of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
because the way to do it is kind of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
because the way to do it is kind of
confusing<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.340> would<00:00:17.490> think<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.820> it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
confusing and you would think that it

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.000 
confusing and you would think that it
wouldn't<00:00:18.930> work<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.830> gonna

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
wouldn't work like that so I'm gonna

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.830 
wouldn't work like that so I'm gonna
