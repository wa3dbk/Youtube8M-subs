00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
just east of the 30 mile which gives a

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.230 
just east of the 30 mile which gives a
lot<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.749> twink<00:00:19.140> rise<00:00:19.640> so<00:00:20.640> we're<00:00:20.759> going<00:00:20.880> putting

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
lot of twink rise so we're going putting

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.339 
those on and see how the bike is so we
got<00:00:25.739> two<00:00:26.099> 12<00:00:26.369> millimeter<00:00:27.119> bolts<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.839> unbolt

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349

the<00:00:28.499> stock<00:00:28.769> bars<00:00:34.940> before<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.210> unbolt<00:00:36.629> them

the stock bars before we unbolt them

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.470 
the stock bars before we unbolt them
you'll<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.260> take<00:00:37.379> off<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.620> little

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
you'll want to take off these little

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.669 
you'll want to take off these little

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
retainer clips on the side because these

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.919 
retainer clips on the side because these
are<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.039> to<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:42.120> let<00:00:42.929> your<00:00:43.109> cables<00:00:43.679> loose

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
are going to just let your cables loose

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.220 
are going to just let your cables loose
focused<00:00:46.640> there<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> go<00:00:47.839> so<00:00:48.839> you<00:00:48.899> should<00:00:49.109> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
focused there you go so you should be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 
focused there you go so you should be
able<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> pull<00:00:49.949> that<00:00:50.039> tab<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.519> and<00:00:51.000> slide<00:00:51.239> them

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
able to pull that tab up and slide them

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
able to pull that tab up and slide them
forward<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:52.589> cables<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:52.980> likely<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
forward the cables are likely going to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.189 
forward the cables are likely going to
meet<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.609> little<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:53.910> length<00:00:54.149> once<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.629> raise

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
meet a little more length once we raise

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.349 
meet a little more length once we raise
them<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:56.519> I'm<00:00:56.609> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> loosen<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
them up so I'm going to loosen these for

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.900 
them up so I'm going to loosen these for
now<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.660> we'll<00:00:57.749> put<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.820> once<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
now and we'll put them back on once you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.070 
now and we'll put them back on once you
get<00:01:00.030> our<00:01:00.149> risers<00:01:00.480> installed<00:01:05.660> so<00:01:06.660> I<00:01:06.690> got<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
get our risers installed so I got the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
get our risers installed so I got the
stock<00:01:07.140> bolt<00:01:07.620> out<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.370> see<00:01:08.610> there's<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
stock bolt out you can see there's a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
stock bolt out you can see there's a
substantial<00:01:10.050> difference<00:01:10.200> between<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
substantial difference between the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
substantial difference between the
aftermarket<00:01:11.430> ones<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.090> makes<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.480> for

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
aftermarket ones and that makes up for

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.640 
aftermarket ones and that makes up for
the<00:01:13.530> extra<00:01:13.620> inch<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.760> bit<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.030> those<00:01:15.150> risers<00:01:15.650> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the extra inch a bit of those risers and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.350 
the extra inch a bit of those risers and
once<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.250> take<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> stock<00:01:17.670> why<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.000> actually

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
once you take the stock why not actually

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000 
once you take the stock why not actually
sits<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:18.720> nicely<00:01:18.930> has<00:01:19.290> little<00:01:19.620> grips<00:01:19.860> on

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
sits there nicely has little grips on

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.790 
sits there nicely has little grips on
the<00:01:20.100> top<00:01:20.330> then<00:01:21.330> we'll<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.650> new

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
the top then we'll take it up with new

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560 
the top then we'll take it up with new
ones<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.550> of<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> tug<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.270> get

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
ones a little bit of a tug we can get

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.670 
ones a little bit of a tug we can get
the<00:01:24.720> bars<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> put<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.350> riser

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the bars up and put in a little riser

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.240 
the bars up and put in a little riser
pads<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> those<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.860> been<00:01:32.010> going<00:01:32.130> side

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.130 

as<00:01:37.250> always<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.820> never<00:01:38.000> hurts<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.390> add<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.870> couple

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
as always it never hurts to add a couple

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.660 
as always it never hurts to add a couple
drops<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.790> Loctite<00:01:42.100> once<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.190> got<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.430> bolts

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670

drops of Loctite once you got the bolts
on<00:01:43.820> there<00:01:43.940> loosely<00:01:44.420> it's<00:01:44.540> always<00:01:44.720> good<00:01:44.900> idea

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
on there loosely it's always good idea

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.480 
on there loosely it's always good idea
