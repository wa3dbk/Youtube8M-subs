00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the left of the torques which is really

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
the left of the torques which is really
hard<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> say<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.720> honest<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.260> the

right is a very very very small

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.030 
right is a very very very small
flat-head<00:01:09.960> screwdriver<00:01:12.770> extension<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
flat-head screwdriver extension really

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.340 
flat-head screwdriver extension really
it<00:01:14.640> works<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:15.810> tell<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it works as you could tell here the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.929 
it works as you could tell here the
torques<00:01:16.710> works<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.820> only

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
torques works pretty well the only

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.960 
torques works pretty well the only
problem<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.650> 100<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
problem is that if it's not 100 that it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.190 
problem is that if it's not 100 that it
could<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.150> fickle<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.659> doesn't<00:01:21.869> always<00:01:21.990> work

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
could be fickle it doesn't always work

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.219 
could be fickle it doesn't always work

screws with small locking mechanisms

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.230 
screws with small locking mechanisms
which<00:02:38.560> quite<00:02:38.770> frankly<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.850> don't<00:02:39.940> even<00:02:40.090> have

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
which quite frankly you don't even have

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
and it should work all right so here's a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.690 
and it should work all right so here's a
hard<00:02:49.510> drive<00:02:49.980> essentially<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.460> just

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
hard drive essentially it's just

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.910 
hard drive essentially it's just
protected<00:02:52.090> by<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.240> metal<00:02:52.990> casing<00:02:53.500> here<00:02:53.740> and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
protected by this metal casing here and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.770 
protected by this metal casing here and
this<00:02:54.010> actually<00:02:54.190> has<00:02:54.490> four<00:02:54.880> more<00:02:55.300> torque

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
this actually has four more torque

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.380 
this actually has four more torque
screws<00:02:56.350> which<00:02:57.160> are<00:02:57.400> larger<00:02:57.850> size<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.300> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
screws which are larger size in the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.310 
screws which are larger size in the
original<00:02:58.570> four<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.710> what<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.400> need<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.700> do<00:03:00.880> is

original four so what you need to do is
grab<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.560> appropriate<00:03:03.130> screw<00:03:03.520> which<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.210> can

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
grab the appropriate screw which you can

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
they're really small so it's not really

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.070 
they're really small so it's not really
anything<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.000> worry<00:03:37.180> about<00:03:37.270> it's<00:03:37.930> probably

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
anything to worry about it's probably

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.840 
anything to worry about it's probably
the<00:03:38.260> more<00:03:38.440> gentle<00:03:39.070> part<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.520> process

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the more gentle part of the process

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.030 
the more gentle part of the process
because<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.140> breast<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.770> know<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
because it's the the breast you know the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.800 
because it's the the breast you know the
casing<00:03:42.459> or<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.730> hard<00:03:42.850> drives<00:03:43.090> really<00:03:43.360> right

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
casing or the hard drives really right

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.470 
casing or the hard drives really right
back<00:03:44.020> there<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:45.610> know<00:03:45.790> need<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.209> super

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
back there so you know need to be super

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.970 
back there so you know need to be super
forceful<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:47.020> it's<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.170> simple<00:03:47.470> job<00:03:47.709> something

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
forceful but it's a simple job something

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.640 
forceful but it's a simple job something
to<00:03:48.220> do<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.550> here's<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.690> aluminum<00:03:50.230> case<00:03:50.410> very

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
to do and here's the aluminum case very

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.970

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
hard drive pull up enough for the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.940 
hard drive pull up enough for the
aluminum<00:04:22.720> 22<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:24.060> get<00:04:25.060> out<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.419> then<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.570> can

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
aluminum 22 to get out and then you can

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.400 
aluminum 22 to get out and then you can
go<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.039> just<00:04:27.250> yank<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.550> out
