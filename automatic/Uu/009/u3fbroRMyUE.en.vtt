00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello hello today I am making a video about 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.649
 how to sew a skirt the sun for an hour 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.660
 hands and for this we with you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.750
 need a half meter thick black 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 Fabric fabrics can choose on your 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 taste and color and wallet but I decided that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.640
 I will be such a fabric is dense on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 winter time of the year that is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 You can come to the store and ask you 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 will bring exactly the fabric that you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 need on 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.399
 for a given period of time is suitable here 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 such cotton thick black fabric 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.050
 to wear a skirt with sweaters with 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.370
 some beautiful blouses 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.469
 than not to freeze for this to us 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.559
 It takes only one and a half meters and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.950
 The principle of operation is very simple. I mean 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 already folded the fabric in half as you see 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.989
 I have everything marked here 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 just tell you that is for this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.289
 we only need two measurements 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 There is the width of your waist and the length of the product 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.820
 let's say the width of my waist is 65 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.970
 centimeters you divide this width in half 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.090
 that is, it turns out about 32 s 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 half in my case you can already 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.759
 draw this semicircle but i decided that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.939
 my skirt will be so small 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.830
 metal assemblies and that is 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.430
 accordingly if you do the assemblies you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.460
 must add a few centimeters 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 not even a half of what 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.790
 you got it, that is, if I 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.350
 thirty two and a half that is but i 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:48.600
 I decided that there will be 60 and have already noted this 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.189
 semicircle and that's basically all steel 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.939
 now we need to mark the length 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.210
 our product is made very easy 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.579
 that is, from those upper points that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.549
 we are already excellent here at first 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.239
 measure 50 centimeters from this side and 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.069
 from this side now we need these 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.999
 points smooth communication lines 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.030
 this is done very easily that is 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:20.790
 measuring tape 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.999
 from the edge of our semicircle and 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.480
 50 centimeters measured here such 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:29.849
 small strokes that is, you lead 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.760
 rearrange a little bit here and here 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.409
 Generally connect then these here 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.730
 shtrishki 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.609
 such smooth lines but that's basically 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.139
 everything is already possible to cut everything very easily and 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.299
 just then we will make a belt 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:48.829
 but in principle with a skirt it's all like you 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.169
 made sure to sew it all can 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.620
 here and so our skirt looks like I already 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:03:00.719
 all cut out and now we work with this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.109
 waist here as I said width 60 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:06.060
 centimeters here this one part of us her 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.919
 need to turn in thirty two with 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.019
 half a centimeter well i mean you already 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:13.019
 Guided by your waist how much 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.040
 what do you need to subtract or add 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.650
 that is, the girl has already said that if you 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.939
 do not do the assembly, that is, you immediately 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.310
 cut like the width of your waist I'm 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:30.840
 I do with assemblies, respectively 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.970
 you need to reduce this width but here 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.829
 already our skirt looks nice 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.519
 Here nowhere appeared such here 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.220
 beautiful assemblies make them very easy 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.659
 and just that is one piece of fabric 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.759
 bent in one direction and the other part 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.239
 bends the other way and by the same 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.680
 principle, I did everything all all here such 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.739
 here 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.359
 I mean , I did not measure anything 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.419
 all about eye 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.790
 that is width but if you haven't 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.629
 it turns out of course in advance you can 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.120
 chalk down the width of your analysis of the hearth I 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.639
 nothing measured out and that's why so here 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.780
 everything worked out beautifully 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.090
 girls final so we are with you 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.799
 do a search for our skirt do it too 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.979
 very easy and simple for this us 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.479
 need a piece of cloth small 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.840
 we will need a centimeter tape 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.290
 to measure 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.860
 the reach of our waist girls for those who 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.810
 sews a zipper skirt you look so 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.570
 your reach and your waist meaning 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.150
 matched your coverage italy 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.699
 which you have ie if it is like 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.550
 I have 65 centimeters it should not be 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.360
 65 centimeters if you sew a skirt on 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.580
 elastic band you have to add 10 there 15 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.050
 centimeters so you could sweat into it 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.600
 climb accordingly I have here I 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.780
 65 and I added and there about 10 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.630
 I got 75 centimeters 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.910
 accordingly you measure out 75 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.370
 centimeters from this point to this point 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.290
 next we take with you the gum 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.110
 don't pay attention to me 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.940
 white I have no other black 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.340
 gum unfortunately ended me but 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.979
 as if white drops also fit in 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.020
 principle there will not be a prominent girl 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.550
 still want to say choose 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.620
 gum in the store is more dense since 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.160
 they will keep our shape well 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.350
 skirt it you will not fly off 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.570
 that is, here is such a tip more such 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.660
 stretching rubber bands they are suitable for 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.849
 summer light fabrics for ours such 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.130
 thick fabric we need accordingly i 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:45.669
 gum that is tight that is you 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.830
 measure your width and my rubber bands 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.060
 three and a half centimeters 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.520
 accordingly here you measure three with 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.919
 half a centimeter and and the second part you 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.130
 measure three and a half centimeters 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:59.830
 because our belt is like this 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:03.849
 we will do it already here 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.669
 Sew on girls before 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:10.090
 sew belt I advise you first 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:16.570
 flash this whole thing and then remove 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:18.789
 here are these needles further belt here 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.130
 you are also flashing 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.500
 and accordingly after you 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.470
 sew you already choose needles and 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.340
 sew belt that is first one 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:34.240
 the part you sew when you're sewn 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.969
 you sew the second part already and we 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.599
 accordingly, then it will turn out 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:43.259
 belt after all of you came already 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:46.049

 it is said to try on a skirt if you need something 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:50.219
 not like the length you like want 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:53.159
 make it smaller you accordingly 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:56.159
 you can prune down there and only then 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:59.129
