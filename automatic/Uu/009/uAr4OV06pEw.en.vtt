00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 and I had problems difficult to solve in 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.540
 a difficult ethic of my life is between 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.830
 the space and the walls and holding the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.830
 opinion of my family 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.300
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.949
 the guitar a song of the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.800
 authentic decadents they are a 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.390
 Ska band formed in the year of 1986 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.939
 in the city of buenos aires argentina 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.070
 we started well let's start 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.710
 learning the little strum which 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.470
 we will use for the whole song more or 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.030
 less would go this way is a meeting 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.320
 extremely easy which is what we do 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.909
 we only do two first up 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.190
 but there is a small shutdown technique 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.489
 We first turn off the note 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.010
 first we turn off landa if they can 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.519
 observe 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.519
 i 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.809
 that would be would be like the basic duster 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 for the music of scale more hands of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.610
 this way with a little bit of rhythm we can 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.610
 change chords 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.929
 that would be the little one the little one and 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.670
 first that I wanted to show you telesca 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.740
 well since we learned what is the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.960
 strumming let's start with the chords 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.140
 of the first part would be what is a 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.509
 yes more we will need what is a mime 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.890
 in this position the biggest crusader 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.490
 sustained minor 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.350
 and phases of the media 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.350
 then let's see direct 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:49.390
 structured we make the we go down here 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.390
 this sharp 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:02:00.080
 we go then we go up to talk and your well 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.820
 that would be the first part good for the 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.950
 second stanza let's add three 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.310
 new chords that would be this sharp 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.759
 higher 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.540
 we will use what is sustained lower 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.800
 and also 2 you did not feel ok 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.800
 then it would be late 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 according to the part we are not what we do 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.060
 this chord my rebel spirit laughed 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
 when we come from the second part we're going 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.860
 here 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.560
 and then we go to this already to finish 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.599
 the stanza I do not understand what is the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.849
 meaning now we are going to learn what 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.709
 is the part of the chorus for estribio 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.880
 let's use what is a step 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.120
 sustained minor 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.440
 a system 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:01.830
 let's use sustained minor 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.090
 we use this we use the we go back to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.340
 go down to that this is a sustained sun 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.860
 but we already learned that we are going to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.250
 also use what is phases had 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.250
 7 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.780
 this 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.630
 we can also do it but so that 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.290
 are a little better would be to feel and 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.390
 we will do for the end 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.390
 17 then it would be 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.050
 true 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:36.870
 and whatever I want in this life I'm going to 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:39.590
 fulfill my case that was the music of 5 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.590
 lifetime 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.659
 we are going to do it once more 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:51.310
 chorus would be for the race from 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:58.460
 who wants in this life I will fulfill my 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:00.530
 vocation was synthetic music life 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.820
 well that would be the refrain since 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.740
 we learn the chorus only we 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.960
 would subtract to learn the part of the choir 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.940
 well for the choir part we're going to 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.130
 need only a small circle 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.870
 musical we are going to give the chords of 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.210
 orderly way for us to do ourselves 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.550
 the idea of ​​how the song would go 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.120
 we will need what is my biggest here 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.290
 crossed then here this yes greater always 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.450
 crossed 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.810
 we go up that is consistent with C sharp 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.810
 less 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.650
 then we passed it to me again and here 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.650
 we make it easy 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:44.050
 and we fall to what is a yes then 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:46.289
 It would be me I do not want to work I do not want 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.289
 marry 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.100
 and now 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.259
 let's do one more time more slowly 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.259
 then it would be me 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.500
 I do not want to get married 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.030
 all day 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:25.400
 a little faster so mother matter 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:28.430
 because love money I'm going to talk 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.259
 you do not upset me good friends that would be the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.000
 tutorial for today's guitar 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.440
 the decadent authentic remembers that 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.419
 can you leave your suggestions here 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.310
 down in the comments give him lay 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.380
 video and share it if you can 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.650
 that would be all from me I see them until 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.650
 the next
