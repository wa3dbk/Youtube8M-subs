00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
done intentionally to get this reaction

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.659

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
cameras were rolling so the question

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.589 
cameras were rolling so the question
that<00:02:34.159> people<00:02:34.219> are<00:02:34.609> asking<00:02:34.669> when<00:02:35.239> they<00:02:35.359> take

that people are asking when they take
the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.970 
the
step<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.409> is<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:37.099> ever<00:02:37.370> okay<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.349> traumatize<00:02:39.349> a
