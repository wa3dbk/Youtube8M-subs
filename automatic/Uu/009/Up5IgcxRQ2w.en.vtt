00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 in a 30 - minute walk to 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619
 moderate intensity you will be burning 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 between 60 and 100 calories with this block 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 high strength training 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 intensity in eight minutes you're going to burn 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.300
 100 adds all this potential to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.830
 Exercise spends quality time with your 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.020
 dog and lass to strengthen glutes and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.870
 legs let's give him the first 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.910
 exercise are squats this is going to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.430
 serve to strengthen leg and gluteus 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 these are upsets to one leg in 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.060
 this kind of exert the effort 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 mainly going to be in the part of 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.899
 buttocks 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 the folds are ideal exercises for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.370
 the whole hip area is to say the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.949
 abductors and the adductors that is the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.350
 internal part in the side squat 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 the focus goes much more towards generating 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.540
 all the effort in one leg 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.150
 working thighs mainly 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.670
 heel lift this is for 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.520
 calf 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 heel pomp in this type of jumps is a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 cardiovascular work in which we can 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 have high intensities and it's going to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.130
 help raise the heart rate and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.229
 achieve our goal of 120 calories in 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.540
 this block of 8 minutes and exhaustion 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.100
 crossing leg back is an exercise in 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.659
 that the effort is also in a 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.460
 leg and that also involves a level 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.049
 extensive coordination all this routine 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.820
 is also aimed at strengthening the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.049
 trunk since you are loading your 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.759
 puppy we are generating a 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.350
 resistance and of course in the part 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.090
 of the shoulders that are supporting the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.830
 load remember that the weight of the dog 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.720
 it must be proportional to your strength like this 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.950
 always looking for a puppy that can 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.830
 be nice and let you finish 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.420
 this circuit successfully to give a 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.220
 variety to cardiovascular work that 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 we perform in which for 30 minutes you 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.850
 you burn more or less 300 calories now 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.679
 that we are training with the puppies 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.929
 who also need exercise and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.190
 get tired we are going to perform sprints that 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.569
 it's the sprints it's a job 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.670
 fractioned in which we will work 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.380
 the speed to be a work of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.149
 speed is a work of force that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.459
 It will help us to gain muscle tone 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.549
 both leg and gluteus and on 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.170
 all in the part of the center of the body 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.970
 let's run at high intensities 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.130
 for 15 or 20 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.990
 or the equivalent of 15 seconds you're going to 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.920
 rest the same amount of time and 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.290
 we repeat at least 15 minutes a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.580
 20 ideally or until your lost is 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.470
 tired 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.630
 go out for a walk your dog is a 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.580
 fundamental need both for them 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 to get distracted and do their things 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.090
 as for us to have certain 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.070
 physical activity and being in contact with 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.690
 the environment however having 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.050
 to be aware that they are 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.240
 listening or they're smelling or that 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.580
 do your needs many times this 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.130
 makes it not so productive is because 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.960
 that the proposal is to make certain 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.430
 strength exercises that give them a chance 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.260
 to them not to feel the mental pressure 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.440
 that they have to hurry and we 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.050
 of strengthening and toning legs and in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.460
 some moments arms also 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.230
 to bring the bag for the poop 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.300
 puppy do not forget to bring water so much for 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.920
 you as for him and of course a prize 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.160
 to reward him for the effort that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.160
 did
