00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
let's do some vocabulary today there is

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.470 
let's do some vocabulary today there is
a<00:00:02.220> Facebook<00:00:03.060> Nielsen<00:00:03.480> survey<00:00:04.140> which<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:05.450> got<00:00:06.450> a

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
a Facebook Nielsen survey which I got a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.870 
a Facebook Nielsen survey which I got a
presentation<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.259> at<00:00:07.470> attack<00:00:08.010> yesterday<00:00:08.639> at

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
presentation of at attack yesterday at

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.400 
presentation of at attack yesterday at
the<00:00:09.030> reception<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.780> basically<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
the reception and basically it's the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.190 
the reception and basically it's the
difference<00:00:10.800> between<00:00:10.860> earned<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.880> paid<00:00:12.200> media

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
difference between earned and paid media

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
difference between earned and paid media
so<00:00:13.799> there<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> lot<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.370> vocabulary<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:15.089> there

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so there is a lot of vocabulary in there

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.080 
so there is a lot of vocabulary in there
so<00:00:15.750> earn<00:00:15.960> media<00:00:16.560> paid<00:00:17.160> media<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.880> media

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so earn media paid media is the media

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
so earn media paid media is the media
you<00:00:18.240> buy<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.050> just<00:00:19.410> buying<00:00:19.619> ads<00:00:19.949> basically

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.050 
more complex
you<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.900> notion<00:00:25.380> where<00:00:26.130> basically<00:00:26.670> people

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
you know notion where basically people

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.919 
you know notion where basically people

recommended<00:02:08.369> form<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> friend<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.989> which<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
recommended form a friend which which is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.370 
recommended form a friend which which is
which<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.670> up

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
which is kind of up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.780 
which is kind of up
but<00:02:12.710> it's<00:02:12.860> interesting<00:02:13.010> because<00:02:13.430> they<00:02:13.640> have

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
but it's interesting because they have

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.440 
but it's interesting because they have
very<00:02:14.290> measured<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.760> when<00:02:16.940> vape<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
conclusion is basically buying social

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.050 
conclusion is basically buying social
media<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.710> different<00:02:22.160> than<00:02:22.310> buying<00:02:22.490> standard

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
and basically it's kind of a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.190 
and basically it's kind of a
recommendation<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.520> do<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:29.960> social

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
if you think about Twitter going they

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.430 
if you think about Twitter going they
tell<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.610> it's<00:02:38.210> basically<00:02:38.720> if<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.930> add<00:02:39.020> sucks

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
and no one endorses it talks about it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.180 
and no one endorses it talks about it
engage<00:02:41.960> with<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.560> kind<00:02:42.710> of<00:02:42.770> disappeared

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
engage with it it's kind of disappeared

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.460 
engage with it it's kind of disappeared
from<00:02:43.310> Twitter<00:02:44.020> kind<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.140> different

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
from Twitter kind of a different

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.140 
from Twitter kind of a different
approach<00:02:45.590> between<00:02:46.190> Facebook<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.790> Twitter<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
approach between Facebook and Twitter I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.500 
approach between Facebook and Twitter I
guess<00:02:47.210> Facebook<00:02:47.750> has<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> huge<00:02:49.120> huge<00:02:50.120> traffic

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
guess Facebook has a huge huge traffic

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.960 
guess Facebook has a huge huge traffic
much<00:02:51.230> bigger<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.950> again<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.490> probably<00:02:52.760> do

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
much bigger so again we can probably do

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.390 
much bigger so again we can probably do
this<00:02:53.120> what<00:02:53.750> means<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.260> what's<00:02:54.530> missing<00:02:54.740> for<00:02:55.160> me

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
this what means is what's missing for me

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.670 
this what means is what's missing for me
is<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.360> all<00:02:56.570> like<00:02:56.870> when<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.230> read<00:02:57.530> this

campaigns<00:03:07.970> campaign<00:03:08.390> campaigns<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.200> all

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
campaigns campaign campaigns it's all

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.690 
campaigns campaign campaigns it's all
about<00:03:09.560> campaigns<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.190> problem<00:03:10.490> is<00:03:10.550> that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
about campaigns the problem is that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.210 
about campaigns the problem is that
brands<00:03:11.150> think<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.720> terms<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.110> campaigns<00:03:12.530> well

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
brands think in terms of campaigns well

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.400 
brands think in terms of campaigns well
I<00:03:13.250> think<00:03:13.490> social<00:03:14.180> media<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.540> not<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.720> convey<00:03:15.080> or

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
I think social media is not a convey or

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.570 
I think social media is not a convey or
is<00:03:15.650> not<00:03:15.770> campaigns<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.390> very<00:03:17.840> long<00:03:18.140> term

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
is not campaigns it's a very long term

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.550 
is not campaigns it's a very long term
you<00:03:19.580> know<00:03:19.700> community<00:03:20.300> building<00:03:20.690> brand<00:03:21.170> trust

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.860 
you know community building brand trust
creation<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.490> engagement<00:03:23.060> with<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.510> brand

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
creation and engagement with a brand

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.980 
creation and engagement with a brand
which<00:03:24.770> is<00:03:24.800> cannot<00:03:25.610> be<00:03:25.760> seen<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.150> campaign<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
which is cannot be seen as campaign and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.290 
which is cannot be seen as campaign and
impressions<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.820> there's<00:03:29.000> something

impressions and so there's something

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.510
