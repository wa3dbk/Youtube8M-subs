cook asparagus it's really quick and
simple<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.629> it<00:00:06.720> makes<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:07.020> nice<00:00:07.259> vegetable<00:00:07.620> for

any<00:00:08.220> weekday<00:00:08.580> meal<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.690> go<00:00:14.719> that's<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
any weekday meal here we go that's the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.480 
any weekday meal here we go that's the
hardest<00:00:16.199> part<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.560> recipe<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.130> cutting

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
hardest part of this recipe is cutting

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.580 
hardest part of this recipe is cutting
the<00:00:17.609> stem<00:00:17.880> off<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.300> asparagus<00:00:18.750> now<00:00:19.080> some

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the stem off the asparagus now some

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
the stem off the asparagus now some
people<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.010> hold<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.580> between<00:00:20.730> their

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
people just hold it in between their

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.359 
people just hold it in between their
hands<00:00:21.390> bend<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> wherever<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> breaks<00:00:23.039> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
hands bend it and wherever it breaks is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.460 
hands bend it and wherever it breaks is
like<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.939> natural<00:00:24.150> breaking<00:00:24.960> point<00:00:25.260> for

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
like the natural breaking point for

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.220 
like the natural breaking point for
where<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.220> bad<00:00:26.430> meets<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.090> good<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.570> then

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
where the bad meets the good and then

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
where the bad meets the good and then
other<00:00:28.560> people<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.640> breaking<00:00:30.000> point<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
other people use that breaking point to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
other people use that breaking point to
measure<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> rest<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.650> Swagger's<00:00:32.130> then

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
measure all the rest in Swagger's then

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
measure all the rest in Swagger's then
they<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> slice<00:00:32.969> off<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.630> stems<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.469> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
they just slice off all the stems and I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.319 
they just slice off all the stems and I
think<00:00:34.800> that's<00:00:34.980> pretty<00:00:35.190> wasteful<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.120> all

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
think that's pretty wasteful because all

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
think that's pretty wasteful because all
the<00:00:36.630> asparagus<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.559> aren't<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> same

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the asparagus don't aren't the same

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
the asparagus don't aren't the same
length<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> same

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
length and they don't have the same

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
length and they don't have the same
breaking<00:00:40.050> points<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
breaking points so I'm just going to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
breaking points so I'm just going to
look<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> goes<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:42.989> white<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
look and see where it goes from white to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.250 
look and see where it goes from white to
green<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.239> where<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.840> starts<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
green like and see where it starts to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
green like and see where it starts to
thin<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:46.890> bit<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> cut<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> there

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
thin out a little bit and cut it there

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
thin out a little bit and cut it there
next<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> heat<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.829> olive<00:00:49.980> oil

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
next I'm going to heat up some olive oil

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
next I'm going to heat up some olive oil
and<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> large<00:00:51.090> skillet<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.809> medium-high

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
heat and add my asparagus to it it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
heat and add my asparagus to it it's
gonna<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.370> hot<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.850> they're<00:00:57.000> gonna

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

gonna get really hot and they're gonna
start<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.750> sizzle<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:58.590> when<00:00:58.770> I'm

till they get kind of wilting bit Dover
and<00:01:24.600> aren't<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.259> pleasing<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> eye

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
for today here's how my asparagus look

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.609 
for today here's how my asparagus look
and<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.390> must<00:01:33.600> say<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.930> were<00:01:33.990> delicious

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and I must say they were delicious

and I must say they were delicious
I<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.159> home<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.400> church<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.210> was

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
I just got home from church and I was

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.469 
I just got home from church and I was
really<00:01:36.509> hungry<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> ate<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> them<00:01:38.479> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
really hungry so I ate all of them but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
really hungry so I ate all of them but
they<00:01:39.600> were<00:01:39.659> well-seasoned<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.710> don't<00:01:40.920> need<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
they were well-seasoned you don't need a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280
