00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:14.670
 I tried to make a tongue vending machine in my high-end later Lego today 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.269
 First of all I would like to introduce you from around 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.840
 First is the horror lever 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:24.800
 It is 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.050
 The next is Wow. There is nothing and a common wall. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.560
 Here is a little behind 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.980
 I can see it 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.980
 Here Oh 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.170
 Thought 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.910
 Side 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.000
 Magically 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:47.820
 There is a place where money can be stored, and here is a place where goods are released 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.820
 It may be a bit b 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:57.680
 I would like to go there once 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:01:00.250
 First of all , if you try to turn the lever without putting any one salt 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.250
 This chapter 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.900
 Nothing came out from the dig Qi 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.660
 but 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.660
 Once 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.010
 of 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.509
 let me in 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.509
 I think 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.040
 In 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.380
 A little bit a bead if 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.790
 The following is said 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.050
 Content 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.040
 I recommend the contents 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.040
 Please wait a moment 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.430
 Yukinoshita 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.930
 Sorry 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.990
 Hmm 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:20.620
 Why products live here 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:24.030
 And if I turn this lever and turn it, it is said that it was locked. 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.030
 I was disturbed by my niece 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.170
 Marbles 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:35.770
 Is is is is good because I can not be earn 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.770
 Put a 1-yen coin through and say if this lever is evil 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.680
 When I put one yen 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.050
 It blows to this white pawn already 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.760
 Forcefully incident 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.790
 here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.350
 Even this white thing is disturbed and this is gone 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.300
 The lever can be turned so goods 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.300
 It is that I can do fruit trees 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.879
 So say one yen coin Well is thought that anywhere 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.250
 It is understood here if you see 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.680
 so 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.659
 Here is the way, Then 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.660
 It can be pulled out like a drawer 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.640
 In Ah 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.640
 ｰｰｰThank you for me to see to the end
