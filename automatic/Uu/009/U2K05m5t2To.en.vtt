00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
apparently this was for math as you can

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.100 
apparently this was for math as you can
see<00:04:02.940> like<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.150> math<00:04:03.390> symbols<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:04.049> there

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
that now mts was a huge gateway import

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.310 
that now mts was a huge gateway import
for<00:04:36.130> hackers<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.700> use<00:04:37.060> duped<00:04:37.720> items<00:04:37.960> that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
for hackers to use duped items that

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.990 
for hackers to use duped items that
would<00:04:38.410> sell<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.620> for<00:04:38.740> NX<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.370> they<00:04:39.760> would<00:04:39.880> be

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
would sell it for NX and they would be

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.690 
would sell it for NX and they would be
trading<00:04:40.510> shuffling<00:04:41.380> around<00:04:41.470> illegal<00:04:42.100> NX<00:04:42.430> as

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
trading shuffling around illegal NX as

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.150 
trading shuffling around illegal NX as
Wells<00:04:43.120> mesas<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.900> items<00:04:44.260> through<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.740> mts

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
Wells mesas and items through the mts

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.360 
Wells mesas and items through the mts
system<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.060> now<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.660> mts<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.200> gone<00:04:47.500> do<00:04:48.220> we

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
system so now that the mts is gone do we

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.650 
system so now that the mts is gone do we
think<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:48.970> market<00:04:49.330> will<00:04:49.419> stay

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
think that the market will stay

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.270 
think that the market will stay

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
gonna be huge but that does mean that us

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.680 
gonna be huge but that does mean that us
legit<00:05:08.410> players<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.220> use<00:05:09.400> those<00:05:10.210> items<00:05:10.419> to

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.550 
make NX that was our only income of NX
that<00:05:13.720> means<00:05:13.870> we<00:05:13.990> will<00:05:14.110> actually<00:05:14.260> have<00:05:14.500> to

style<00:05:26.140> but<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.560> know<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.830> could<00:05:26.979> be<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.160> good

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
style but you know it could be a good

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.760 
style but you know it could be a good
change<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.270> might<00:05:28.419> be<00:05:28.450> back<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.590> the

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
change and it might be back to the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.170 
change and it might be back to the
original<00:05:30.100> maplestory<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.640> we<00:05:30.729> love<00:05:30.940> so<00:05:30.970> much

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
original maplestory that we love so much

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.420 
original maplestory that we love so much
because<00:05:31.390> back<00:05:31.630> then<00:05:31.870> in<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.890> maplestory<00:05:33.340> I

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
because back then in the maplestory I

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.130 
because back then in the maplestory I
know<00:05:33.490> is<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.820> EXP<00:05:34.240> use<00:05:34.360> different<00:05:34.780> leveling

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
know is the EXP use different leveling

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.560 
know is the EXP use different leveling
is<00:05:35.229> easier<00:05:35.560> now<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:36.370> back<00:05:36.940> then<00:05:37.000> there<00:05:37.419> was<00:05:37.540> no

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
is easier now but back then there was no

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.320 
is easier now but back then there was no
mts<00:05:38.080> system<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.620> we<00:05:39.100> had<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.460> do<00:05:39.610> just<00:05:40.120> pure

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
mts system and we had to do just pure

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.090 
mts system and we had to do just pure
annex<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:40.990> but<00:05:41.260> then<00:05:41.440> back<00:05:41.620> then<00:05:41.830> there<00:05:42.010> was

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
annex and but then back then there was

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.250 
annex and but then back then there was
no<00:05:42.130> cubes<00:05:42.610> nothing<00:05:43.300> that<00:05:43.450> NX<00:05:43.870> made<00:05:44.080> you

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
no cubes nothing that NX made you

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.630 
no cubes nothing that NX made you
stronger<00:05:44.650> it<00:05:44.890> was<00:05:44.979> just<00:05:45.100> for<00:05:45.220> looks<00:05:45.490> and

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
stronger it was just for looks and

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.909 
stronger it was just for looks and
convenience<00:05:46.300> like<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.080> pets<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.680> all<00:05:47.770> that

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
convenience like the pets and all that

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.710 
convenience like the pets and all that
stuff<00:05:48.070> but<00:05:48.190> now<00:05:48.430> there's<00:05:48.610> cubes<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.330> alien

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
stuff but now there's cubes and alien

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.469 
stuff but now there's cubes and alien
cubes<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:50.470> rings<00:05:51.070> and/or<00:05:51.520> rings<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.330> don't

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
cubes and rings and/or rings and I don't

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.530 
cubes and rings and/or rings and I don't
it<00:05:52.810> cetera<00:05:53.620> for<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.190> dependents<00:05:55.060> lot<00:05:55.240> thing

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
it cetera for the dependents lot thing

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.030 
it cetera for the dependents lot thing
so<00:05:56.080> now<00:05:56.200> it's<00:05:56.380> a<00:05:56.440> lot<00:05:56.620> of<00:05:56.740> different<00:05:57.010> things

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
so now it's a lot of different things

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.800 
so now it's a lot of different things
that<00:05:57.310> NX<00:05:57.669> will<00:05:57.850> actually<00:05:58.120> make<00:05:58.210> you<00:05:58.390> stronger

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
that NX will actually make you stronger

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.140 
that NX will actually make you stronger
so<00:05:59.530> we<00:05:59.650> kind<00:05:59.860> of<00:05:59.919> need<00:06:00.100> NX<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.669> keep<00:06:00.850> up<00:06:01.000> with

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
so we kind of need NX to keep up with

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.420 
so we kind of need NX to keep up with
the<00:06:01.360> more<00:06:02.050> hard-hitting<00:06:02.590> players<00:06:03.130> out<00:06:03.400> there

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
the more hard-hitting players out there

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.040 
the more hard-hitting players out there
but<00:06:04.090> now<00:06:04.180> they're<00:06:04.300> taking<00:06:04.510> away<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.690> mts

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
but now they're taking away the mts

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.990 
but now they're taking away the mts
