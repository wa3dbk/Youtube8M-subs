the<00:02:16.710> chip<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.480> redundancies<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the chip to have redundancies in it so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.890 
the chip to have redundancies in it so
that<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.220> section<00:02:20.760> fell<00:02:21.360> over<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.750> other

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that if a section fell over in other

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.780 
that if a section fell over in other
words<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.170> no<00:02:22.500> longer<00:02:22.680> operational<00:02:23.100> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
words is no longer operational it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
words is no longer operational it
wouldn't<00:02:24.270> die<00:02:24.720> wouldn't<00:02:25.290> kill<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.530> entire

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
wouldn't die wouldn't kill the entire

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.700 
wouldn't die wouldn't kill the entire
chip<00:02:26.390> however<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> problem<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
chip however the problem with this is it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.470 
chip however the problem with this is it
makes<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.100> chip<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.550> more<00:02:29.670> convoluted<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
makes the chip a lot more convoluted and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.430 
makes the chip a lot more convoluted and
complicated<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:31.230> produce<00:02:31.700> therefore

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
complicated to produce therefore

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
complicated to produce therefore
churning<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.740> large<00:02:35.100> number<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.610> those<00:02:35.880> in

churning out a large number of those in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.870 
churning out a large number of those in
theory<00:02:36.630> at<00:02:36.840> least<00:02:37.370> becomes<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.520> little<00:02:38.670> bit

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
theory at least becomes a little bit

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.670 
theory at least becomes a little bit
trickier<00:02:39.710> however<00:02:41.090> Kevin<00:02:42.090> Kree<00:02:42.660> will<00:02:42.900> give

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
Xbox one is a pretty damn complicated

Xbox one is a pretty damn complicated
console<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.709> what<00:03:49.860> are<00:03:49.890> my<00:03:50.040> thoughts<00:03:50.070> on<00:03:50.550> this

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
console so what are my thoughts on this

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.060 
console so what are my thoughts on this
is<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.180> true<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.690> false<00:03:52.080> well<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.800> very

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
is it true is it false well it's very

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.240 
is it true is it false well it's very
difficult<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.550> say<00:03:53.850> because<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.739> problem

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
difficult to say because that problem

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.360 
difficult to say because that problem
with<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.459> xbox<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.560> mean<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.160> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
with the xbox one and I mean that in a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.270 
with the xbox one and I mean that in a
very<00:03:59.400> nice<00:03:59.790> way<00:03:59.850> I<00:04:00.209> don't<00:04:00.600> mean<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.040> be<00:04:02.040> like

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
very nice way I don't mean to be like

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.540 
very nice way I don't mean to be like
you<00:04:03.030> know<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.420> negative<00:04:03.620> manner<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:05.459> the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
you know in a negative manner but the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.340 
you know in a negative manner but the
problem<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.000> xbox<00:04:06.420> one<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.989> terms<00:04:07.230> of

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
problem of the xbox one in terms of

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.320 
problem of the xbox one in terms of
reporting<00:04:07.500> news<00:04:08.160> from<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.030> other<00:04:09.150> words

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
reporting news from it so in other words

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.940 
reporting news from it so in other words
from<00:04:09.480> my<00:04:09.660> point<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.080> view<00:04:10.140> not<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.590> much<00:04:10.709> for

from my point of view not so much for

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.010 
from my point of view not so much for
you<00:04:11.130> but<00:04:11.790> for<00:04:11.820> my<00:04:12.090> point<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.510> view<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:12.870> an

you but for my point of view it's an

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.720 
you but for my point of view it's an
absolute<00:04:13.560> nightmare<00:04:13.830> because<00:04:14.489> there's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
absolute nightmare because there's

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.330 
absolute nightmare because there's
always<00:04:15.120> like<00:04:15.270> a<00:04:15.300> deluge<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:16.020> rumors<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.680> it's

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
always like a deluge of rumors and it's

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.550 
always like a deluge of rumors and it's
dead<00:04:17.609> lose<00:04:17.790> your<00:04:17.970> speculation<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.140> problem

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
dead lose your speculation the problem

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.090 
dead lose your speculation the problem
is<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:22.229> lot<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.830> conflicting

lot of questions regarding the xbox one
and<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.770> purpose<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.310> some<00:04:59.790> of<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.030> well<00:05:00.810> so

and the purpose of some of it well so

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.420 
and the purpose of some of it well so
basically<00:05:01.350> sort<00:05:01.590> of<00:05:01.680> construction<00:05:02.310> for

example the esram and so on I'm not
going<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.860> really<00:05:04.950> bore<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.400> with<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
going to really bore you with the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.580 
going to really bore you with the
details<00:05:05.640> in<00:05:06.150> this<00:05:06.240> particular<00:05:06.420> video<00:05:06.840> but

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
details in this particular video but

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.830 
details in this particular video but
it's<00:05:08.100> very<00:05:08.460> difficult<00:05:08.670> to<00:05:08.940> say<00:05:09.150> just<00:05:09.360> how<00:05:09.540> true

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
it's very difficult to say just how true

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.960 
it's very difficult to say just how true
this<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.440> guess<00:05:11.340> we'll<00:05:11.520> just<00:05:11.550> have<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:11.850> see

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
this is I guess we'll just have to see

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.340 
this is I guess we'll just have to see
in<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.270> next<00:05:12.390> couple<00:05:12.660> of<00:05:12.810> days<00:05:12.960> hopefully

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
in the next couple of days hopefully

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.980 
in the next couple of days hopefully
Mike<00:05:14.040> saw<00:05:14.310> Microsoft<00:05:15.180> I'm<00:05:15.300> sorry<00:05:15.540> I'm<00:05:15.750> one<00:05:15.930> of

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
Mike saw Microsoft I'm sorry I'm one of

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.300 
Mike saw Microsoft I'm sorry I'm one of
those<00:05:16.050> days<00:05:16.260> where<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.620> wants<00:05:16.800> me<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.920> speak

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
those days where just wants me to speak

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.600 
those days where just wants me to speak
properly<00:05:17.960> Microsoft<00:05:18.960> will<00:05:19.170> let<00:05:20.070> us<00:05:20.190> know<00:05:20.250> one

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
properly Microsoft will let us know one

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.830 
properly Microsoft will let us know one
way<00:05:20.790> or<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.970> other<00:05:21.030> as<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.480> said<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.780> is

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
way or the other as I said it is

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.500 
way or the other as I said it is
unconcerned<00:05:22.650> at<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.100> moment<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:24.060> guess

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
unconcerned at the moment so I guess

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.210 
unconcerned at the moment so I guess
we'll<00:05:24.690> just<00:05:24.720> have<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.020> see<00:05:25.140> regardless<00:05:26.070> hope

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
we'll just have to see regardless hope

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.800 
we'll just have to see regardless hope
you've<00:05:26.520> enjoyed<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:27.000> relatively<00:05:27.390> brief
