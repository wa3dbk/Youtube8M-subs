it's<00:01:27.740> quite<00:01:27.950> rare<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.970> think

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
it's quite rare to see that I think

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.300 
it's quite rare to see that I think
independent<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.110> us<00:01:30.260> means<00:01:30.620> being<00:01:30.890> able<00:01:31.130> to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
independent to us means being able to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.540 
independent to us means being able to
create<00:01:31.730> something<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.800> we<00:01:33.800> want<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.220> create

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
create something that we want to create

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.170 
create something that we want to create
that<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:35.540> think<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.580> we<00:01:37.580> think<00:01:37.760> that<00:01:37.880> it's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
that that we think is we think that it's

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.370 
that that we think is we think that it's
something<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:38.720> we'd<00:01:38.900> love<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.170> play

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
something that we'd love to play

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.960 
something that we'd love to play
ourselves<00:01:39.620> so<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.190> hope<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.520> other<00:01:40.610> people

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
ourselves so we hope that other people

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.219 
ourselves so we hope that other people
will<00:01:41.260> so<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.650> think<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.580> changes<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
will so I think that the changes in the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.780 
will so I think that the changes in the
way<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.500> people<00:01:45.979> are<00:01:46.040> playing<00:01:46.159> games<00:01:46.520> now

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
way that people are playing games now

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.950 
way that people are playing games now
and<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.060> way<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.300> people<00:01:47.420> are<00:01:47.570> buying<00:01:47.780> games

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.750 
and the way the people are buying games
means<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.620> we<00:01:48.740> can<00:01:48.920> deliver<00:01:49.159> something<00:01:49.490> that

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
means that we can deliver something that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.510

that's what independent to us means is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.840 
that's what independent to us means is
that<00:01:54.050> it's<00:01:54.350> it's<00:01:55.010> something<00:01:55.400> that<00:01:55.550> we<00:01:55.640> can

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
that it's it's something that we can

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.250 
that it's it's something that we can

I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:18.620> he'll<00:02:19.620> blade<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:21.440> consistent<00:02:22.440> with

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
I think he'll blade is consistent with

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.010 
I think he'll blade is consistent with
what<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.400> like<00:02:23.910> as<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.180> studio<00:02:24.450> which<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.870> art

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
what we like as a studio which is art

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.640 
what we like as a studio which is art
direction<00:02:25.590> which<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.430> strong<00:02:26.940> story<00:02:27.650> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
direction which is a strong story and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.290 
direction which is a strong story and
and<00:02:29.190> combat<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
and combat and that's really what the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.880 
and combat and that's really what the
games<00:02:30.480> about<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.560> look<00:02:31.770> at

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890

that bit of Buffy the Vampire Slayer

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.610 
that bit of Buffy the Vampire Slayer
where<00:03:12.540> she<00:03:12.630> goes<00:03:12.750> back<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> meets<00:03:13.260> original

where she goes back and meets original
Slayer<00:03:13.830> but<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.790> kind<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.180> feeling<00:03:15.239> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
Slayer but it's that kind of feeling to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.120 
Slayer but it's that kind of feeling to
it<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.049> gonna<00:03:16.140> be<00:03:16.290> very<00:03:16.500> removed<00:03:16.769> from

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it is it gonna be very removed from

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.910 
it is it gonna be very removed from
reality<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.910> gonna<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.150> quite<00:03:18.299> fantasy<00:03:19.640> so

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
reality is it gonna be quite fantasy so

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.740 
reality is it gonna be quite fantasy so
it's<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.310> about<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:25.500> about<00:03:25.680> her<00:03:26.750> journey

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
into into a type of hell so you can

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.110 
into into a type of hell so you can
expect<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:34.140> think<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.070> similar<00:03:35.400> type<00:03:35.790> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
expect I think a similar type of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120 
expect I think a similar type of
aesthetic<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> similar<00:03:37.799> type<00:03:38.100> of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
aesthetic and a similar type of

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.060 
aesthetic and a similar type of
surrealism<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.269> players<00:03:39.810> soar<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.560> DMC

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
surrealism that players soar in in DMC

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.370 
surrealism that players soar in in DMC
that's<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.269> that's<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.690> aim<00:03:42.840> at<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.049> moment

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
that's the that's the aim at the moment

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.930 
that's the that's the aim at the moment
they<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.160> nests<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:45.049> heavenly<00:03:46.049> sword<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
they the nests of heavenly sword and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.340

enslaved<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.060> DMC<00:03:48.390> vol<00:03:48.570> actually<00:03:48.959> had<00:03:49.110> quite

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
enslaved in DMC vol actually had quite

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.960 
enslaved in DMC vol actually had quite
different<00:03:49.890> combat<00:03:50.250> types<00:03:50.549> but<00:03:50.760> they've<00:03:50.880> all

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
different combat types but they've all

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.180 
different combat types but they've all
been<00:03:51.269> very<00:03:51.299> action<00:03:51.930> based<00:03:52.110> can<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.070> some

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
been very action based can we have some

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.590 
been very action based can we have some
idea<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.579> what<00:03:53.790> hell<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.120> will<00:03:54.239> be<00:03:54.390> like

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
idea of what hell they will be like

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.410 
idea of what hell they will be like
combat<00:03:55.320> wise<00:03:55.500> yeah<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.040> mean<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.420> we're

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
combat wise yeah I mean we we're

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.600 
combat wise yeah I mean we we're
extremely<00:03:58.230> early<00:03:58.530> on<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.010> project<00:03:59.160> like

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
extremely early on in the project like

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.130 
extremely early on in the project like
we've<00:03:59.820> literally<00:04:00.090> been<00:04:00.209> working<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.870> for

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
we've literally been working on it for

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.560 
we've literally been working on it for
about<00:04:01.170> three<00:04:01.860> or<00:04:01.950> four<00:04:02.070> months<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:03.120> we're

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
about three or four months so we're

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.930 
about three or four months so we're
really<00:04:03.720> early<00:04:04.049> stages<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:05.670> we're<00:04:05.850> not

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
really early stages so we're not

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.140 
really early stages so we're not
entirely

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
entirely

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.420 
entirely
clear<00:04:07.569> on<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.560> exactly<00:04:08.920> how<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.069> combats

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
clear on to exactly how the combats

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.210 
clear on to exactly how the combats
going<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.640> be<00:04:09.760> but<00:04:10.000> it's<00:04:10.150> it's<00:04:10.629> gonna<00:04:10.810> be

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
going to be but it's it's gonna be

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.660 
going to be but it's it's gonna be
uncompromising

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
uncompromising

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.920 
uncompromising
you<00:04:12.970> know<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.239> it's<00:04:13.629> going<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.810> be

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
you know that it's going to be

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.650 
you know that it's going to be
uncompromising<00:04:14.260> brutal<00:04:15.129> combat<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.540> can

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
uncompromising brutal combat so you can

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.909 
uncompromising brutal combat so you can
expect<00:04:17.079> something<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.919> is<00:04:18.870> similar<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.229> DMC

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
expect something that is similar to DMC

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.040 
expect something that is similar to DMC
in<00:04:21.100> terms<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.639> depth<00:04:21.880> as<00:04:22.570> opposed<00:04:22.900> to

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
in terms of the depth as opposed to

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.710 
in terms of the depth as opposed to
enslave<00:04:23.380> which<00:04:23.800> was<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.330> sort<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.389> light<00:04:25.570> to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
enslave which was a sort of light to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.300 
enslave which was a sort of light to
combat<00:04:26.020> system<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.850> kind<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.979> guess<00:04:29.979> I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
combat system and I I kind of guess I

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.460 
combat system and I I kind of guess I

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
three months in the development I guess

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.510
