reason I did not like them is because

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.980 
reason I did not like them is because
they<00:01:12.280> were<00:01:12.369> very<00:01:12.609> tight<00:01:12.939> on<00:01:12.969> the<00:01:13.209> it<00:01:13.869> was

actually<00:01:14.319> loose<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.920> top<00:01:15.130> which<00:01:15.789> is<00:01:15.939> a

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
actually loose on the top which is a

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.489 
actually loose on the top which is a
problem<00:01:16.359> for<00:01:16.509> me<00:01:16.630> because<00:01:16.869> I'm<00:01:16.959> smaller<00:01:17.289> on

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
problem for me because I'm smaller on

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.889 
problem for me because I'm smaller on
top<00:01:17.709> and<00:01:18.159> very<00:01:18.459> tight<00:01:18.759> on<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.090> bottom<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.719> I'm

bigger<00:01:20.139> on<00:01:20.319> the<00:01:20.439> bottom<00:01:20.469> so<00:01:21.069> that<00:01:21.100> always

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
bigger on the bottom so that always

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.139 
bigger on the bottom so that always
happens<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.939> me

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.169 
them at the beginning of summer and they
didn't<00:01:43.779> work<00:01:43.959> out<00:01:44.109> and<00:01:44.469> they<00:01:44.590> were<00:01:44.709> around

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
didn't work out and they were around

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.389 
didn't work out and they were around
almost<00:01:46.179> $1000<00:01:47.079> now<00:01:47.349> they<00:01:47.499> were<00:01:47.619> made<00:01:47.889> in<00:01:48.039> Italy

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
almost $1000 now they were made in Italy

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.370 
almost $1000 now they were made in Italy
and<00:01:48.429> such<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.389> guess<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.109> counts<00:01:50.229> for

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
and such so I guess that counts for

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.069 
and such so I guess that counts for
something<00:01:50.529> and<00:01:51.069> I<00:01:52.060> never<00:01:52.359> thought<00:01:52.719> I'd<00:01:52.869> find

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
something and I never thought I'd find

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.800 
something and I never thought I'd find

another pair of 70 style tight sexy
denim<00:01:56.529> overalls<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:57.340> then<00:01:57.849> frame<00:01:58.179> denim<00:01:58.630> came

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:59.620 
denim overalls and then frame denim came
around

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
around

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.100 
around
I<00:01:59.659> love<00:02:00.380> their<00:02:00.619> denim<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.820> they<00:02:02.630> made<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.869> pair

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110

of<00:02:03.170> overalls<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:03.740> was<00:02:03.860> strikingly<00:02:04.369> similar

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
of overalls it was strikingly similar

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.910 
of overalls it was strikingly similar
but<00:02:05.329> with<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.479> much<00:02:05.750> better<00:02:05.960> cut<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.500> fit<00:02:06.680> for

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
but with a much better cut and fit for

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.710 
but with a much better cut and fit for
me<00:02:07.009> first<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.820> all<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.060> denim<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.509> much

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
me first of all the denim is much

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.749 
me first of all the denim is much
lighter<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.110> thinner<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.069> too<00:02:10.310> thin<00:02:10.580> you

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
lighter and thinner but not too thin you

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.400 
lighter and thinner but not too thin you
can<00:02:10.940> still<00:02:11.180> definitely<00:02:11.360> tell<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:11.959> denim<00:02:12.290> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
can still definitely tell it's denim and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.650

it feels like denim they're not quite as

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.050 
it feels like denim they're not quite as
long<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.470> works<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:15.800> people<00:02:15.920> like<00:02:16.370> me<00:02:16.610> who
