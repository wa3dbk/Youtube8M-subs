with<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.410> rounded<00:00:16.920> square<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:18.320> make<00:00:19.320> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
with just a rounded square I make it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.230 
with just a rounded square I make it
fill<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:19.949> 2/3<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> screen<00:00:20.939> kind<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
fill about 2/3 of the screen kind of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
fill about 2/3 of the screen kind of
rectangular<00:00:21.720> shape<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.619> add<00:00:22.859> another<00:00:23.010> one

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
rectangular shape then add another one

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.730 
rectangular shape then add another one
and<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.359> bigger<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.869> hide<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> just

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
and make it bigger and hide it just

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.890 
and make it bigger and hide it just
behind<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.279> turn<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.869> just

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
behind it and turn it to the right just

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.169 
behind it and turn it to the right just
very<00:00:28.619> slightly<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> gets<00:00:29.609> kind<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> an

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
very slightly just so it gets kind of an

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.350 
very slightly just so it gets kind of an
off<00:00:30.480> off<00:00:31.109> squared<00:00:31.560> kind<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.009> shape<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
off off squared kind of shape and then

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
off off squared kind of shape and then
add<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.809> borders<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.559> by<00:00:34.800> just

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
add some borders I do that by just

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.530 
add some borders I do that by just
duplicating<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> layers<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.149> pushing<00:00:36.450> them

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
duplicating the layers and pushing them

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.119 
duplicating the layers and pushing them
through<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> background<00:00:37.170> coloring<00:00:38.010> them

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
through the background coloring them

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.200 
through the background coloring them
black<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> make<00:00:38.610> them<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:39.120> bigger

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
black and make them a little bit bigger
before<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> screen<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.800> added<00:00:41.129> another<00:00:41.250> little

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
before the screen I added another little

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
before the screen I added another little
rounded<00:00:42.090> square<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.410> turn<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> left

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
rounded square and I turn it to the left

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
rounded square and I turn it to the left
ever<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.910> slightly<00:00:45.210> cuz<00:00:45.660> BMO<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.620> quite

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
over again in an hex shape and then for

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.580 
over again in an hex shape and then for
the<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> names<00:02:34.390> BMO<00:02:34.780> down<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> side<00:02:35.380> I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
the for the M I kind of expanded it a

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.059 
the for the M I kind of expanded it a
little<00:02:43.480> bit<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.140> eventually<00:02:44.349> do<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.920> with

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069

that ahead of time now for the O
all<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.440> did<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.430> use<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.940> circle

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
all I did is just use this circle

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.750 
all I did is just use this circle
outline<00:02:52.810> shape<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.950> roll<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.340> don't<00:02:54.549> know<00:02:54.610> it's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
outline shape the roll I don't know it's

the<00:02:55.269> cartoon<00:02:55.989> eye<00:02:56.260> shape<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.000> then<00:02:58.660> ya<00:02:59.170> see

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the cartoon eye shape and then ya see

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.590 
the cartoon eye shape and then ya see
there<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.590> go<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.040> kind<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.430> redo<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> V<00:03:01.329> there

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
there I go I kind of redo the V there

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.509 
there I go I kind of redo the V there
and<00:03:04.560> color<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.799> same<00:03:05.950> color<00:03:06.160> as<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
and color at the same color as the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.449 
and color at the same color as the
letters<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.989> now<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.530> tried<00:03:08.889> putting<00:03:09.160> an<00:03:09.340> arm

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
letters and now I tried putting an arm

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.250 
letters and now I tried putting an arm
on<00:03:09.700> him<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.060> didn't<00:03:10.540> think<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.840> arm<00:03:11.019> looked

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
on him I didn't think the arm looked

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.960 
on him I didn't think the arm looked
quite<00:03:11.470> right<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.889> couldn't<00:03:12.310> get<00:03:12.609> it<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.730> work

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
quite right I couldn't get it to work

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.449 
quite right I couldn't get it to work
right<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.540> eventually<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:14.680> got<00:03:15.010> rid<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.340> it

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
right I eventually just got rid of it

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.280 
right I eventually just got rid of it

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
and I felt like the Oh was just a little

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.520 
and I felt like the Oh was just a little
too<00:03:20.290> thin<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.859> wind<00:03:21.220> up<00:03:21.430> duplicating<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.269> O

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
too thin so I wind up duplicating the O

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.150 
too thin so I wind up duplicating the O
and<00:03:23.530> kind<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.859> giving<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.519> little<00:03:24.760> extra<00:03:25.030> a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
and kind of giving it a little extra a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.110 
and kind of giving it a little extra a
little<00:03:27.160> thickness<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:29.010> high<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.310> yeah<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.790> was

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
little thickness and high so yeah I was

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.940 
little thickness and high so yeah I was
just<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.690> arm<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.590> working<00:03:32.920> for

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
just like this arm is is not working for
