00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.859
 Lozinsky Boeing is close to how 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.420
 never russian union of engineers 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.060
 which very carefully 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.160
 conducted his own investigation 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.900
 air crashes claimed 298 human 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.270
 lives got a picture from the satellite 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.800
 made in the area and at the time of the tragedy 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.070
 let's consider it 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.830
 boeing 737 flies son to wash at home 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.600
 in Kuala Lumpur in this place the dust goes 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.880
 to the east there passes the international 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.039
 airway to the right Donetsk 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.859
 this rectangle is nothing but 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.539
 airport strip 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.819
 Left Gorlovka once straight ahead 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.260
 gently and the game was the very power next to 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:42.019
 which we dropped parts of the aircraft 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.749
 lounging in the air thin white 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.729
 line out from under the wing of the military 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.280
 aircraft and departing in the direction of Boeing 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.979
 air-to-air rocket track experts 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.489
 suggest that this fighter mig-29 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.289
 at the bottom of the photo the date and time of the poop and 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.440
 who lives the world civil 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.530
 aviation 15 1947 plus two hours 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.570
 local Ukrainian may be striking 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.369
 rocket elements will sew boeing booths and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.170
 even tear her on the ground a cabin in 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.329
 anyway found much kilometer 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.439
 ahead of the place where the main ones fell 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.140
 fuselage fragments 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.570
 I remind you that the spread of debris is extremely 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.549
 unusual if this picture is reliable then 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.250
 the cabin just flew forward power 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.170
 streamlined designs now 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 the origin of this photo is history 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.799
 more than curious as I said 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.049
 Russian Union of Engineers held 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.700
 own detailed investigation there 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.100
 collected and analyzed all available 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.079
 disaster information was studied intently 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.960
 every detail every parameter and came to 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.340
 I conclude that there is no book about anything so much 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.880
 spoke or another ground-to-air rocket 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.439
 there was no version of our boeing experts 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.869
 shot down by cannon armament 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.880
 another aircraft union of engineers 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.219
 published his detailed report in 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.590
 on the Internet and on several 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.749
 foreign languages eventually became the answer 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.079
 Does he receive a lot of letters with engineers 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:02.840
 Our version calculations and here are the 12th 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.969
 I got this satellite image from 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.680
 An explanation of what Boeing really was 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.020
 shot down by a fighter chasing him 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.400
 first the crew fired from a cannon then 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.360
 the cabin was hit by a rocket 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 air-to-air 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.080
 then right engine and right wing 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.420
 were hit by a rocket with heat 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.340
 homing message system 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.310
 signed by somebody 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.500
 george beat there air expert with 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.580
 20 years of experience and graduate 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.370
 massachusetts technology 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.180
 the institute 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.520
 we see a space image in front of us 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.970
 made and with not very high orbit and 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.720
 usually done these kinds of pictures for the general 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.380
 intelligence 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.510
 air and ground space in 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.810
 according to the coordinates given 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.550
 in the picture we can assume that this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.140
 Photo taken from American or 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.780
 English companion we spent 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.520
 detailed analysis of this snapshot and no 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.520
 no signs of falsification
