00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.089
 what are glasses with holes? 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.360
 pinhole glasses these glasses serve to 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.070
 see clearly how the principle works 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 of the pinhole is a principle 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.619
 physical through which through these holes 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.410
 you see the plastic lenses of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.210
 these glasses the oblique rays of light 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.820
 they don't just pass 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 parallel and in this way the image 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 falls sharply on the retina you can 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 see it also to this design that is me 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.239
 arrived with the glasses bb is called 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.010
 so this product is this way 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.290
 single for each allows for a loan 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 is an astigmatist can see 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.750
 neatly without the need to carry 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.059
 their corrective glasses to understand 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 the pinhole principle you can 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.360
 take a headset for the various 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.980
 this garments department is called 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.469
 headphone maybe in your part we give you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 beretta cap I don't know you can 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.390
 expand it in a given way to see the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 plot and approach it this way not 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 keep if you are nearsighted you will notice that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.420
 you can see the same thing clearly 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 do it by taking your hand by doing 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.000
 a little bucherelli know with your fingers and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.110
 looking through this you will see 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.119
 the principle of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.909
 pinhole I wear a beautiful 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.650
 video here and in description explaining 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 scientifically this principle 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 since I am a man of science though 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 cabbage you do this I'm losing 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 any form of credibility are 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.009
 went to see if there are any studies 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.590
 scientific studies concerning glasses 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.329
 the only study with pinhole holes 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 scientific I found is this that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.970
 see what they did here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 scientists took two groups of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.720
 people who measured their vision then 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 they put glasses on holes 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 pinhole cameras for a week do not say 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.439
 how much time per day indeed for 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.500
 I don't like this study 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.990
 a lot and milano have re-measured the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 view a week later what they have 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.619
 discovered that actually glasses 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 pinhole conifers have improved 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.570
 visual acuity and other characteristics 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 of the vision, however, have not improved 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.860
 other features of vision e 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.140
 however find the link this study 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.810
 always in description was 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.470
 interesting to find them also in this 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.330
 book where we talk about a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.790
 rehabilitation therapy for 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.790
 the balance and we come to the question 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.800
 why a person should wear them 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.440
 glasses and pinhole holes in this 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 case the b glasses with regard to the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.570
 my experience I find them a good one 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 alternative to corrective eyewear 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.920
 classic to see on the long ones 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.440
 distances in the case of us short-sighted that 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.010
 which is known when I wear glasses and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.560
 pinhole holes is who I feel 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.420
 much more relaxed also relax 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.950
 neck muscles noticed because there is a 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.530
 connection between eye muscles i 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.850
 neck muscles and also with posture 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.190
 in general, corrective glasses 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.140
 they tend to stare while 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.209
 these glasses tend to make you move 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.920
 more eyewear manufacturers for 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.170
 pinhole cameras say they do make a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.790
 micro gymnastics eyes personally 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.800
 I included them in my 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.870
 lament called dc tenths 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.180
 challenge also found in the description 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.790
 however I do not recommend bringing them more than 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.190
 so much time per day of course never for 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.530
 drive and for me 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.800
 the open environment annoys me a lot 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.269
 because they take away a lot of light 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.459
 outdoor or even closed 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.670
 in fact one of the side effects 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.340
 let's say the holes is that they remove the light e 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.430
 these breast holes these glasses with i 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.080
 pinhole holes are not suitable for everyone 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.640
 in fact I advise you to go and see 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.640
 the interview he did last 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.890
 sad luca baldassari where light exposes 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.340
 his point of view the difference between 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.830
 glasses and a pair of glasses e 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.200
 Common pinhole holes I found 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.959
 on gays where they don't have a brand there is one 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.260
 brand is that I found the glasses 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.239
 much more comfortable and even more resistant 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.250
 in fact these glasses included on gays 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.019
 after a while, as you can see, you lose 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.180
 resistance and are also very uncomfortable 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.340
 indeed applied these nominations here for 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.200
 the nose is another difference they have 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.959
 given even while out of glasses 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.760
 taken on ebay are comedians outside of 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.090
 glasses you will never see on video are 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.390
 a truncated cone this according to i 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.280
 manufacturers leads to a better transition 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.510
 in the light, however, he still invites 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.160
 the invitation to leave 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.570
 in-depth in the last comments 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.940
 difference he noticed lies in the 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.690
 grid of eyeglass holes 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.730
 reticulated is much more regular 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.920
 as you can see they are parallel lines and lines 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.950
 perpendicular instead had in 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.750
 no brand glasses took the holes on ebay 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.060
 they are distributed differently 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.020
 this video is over thank you for 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.890
 the attention was less intense for 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.740
 deepening I strongly recommend you to 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.140
 deepen the topic found in 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.940
 description all the links and if you want 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.620
 you can leave a comment 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.210
 that the video you liked vividly a 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.090
 put a I like to subscribe to 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.090
 channel see you at the next video hello
