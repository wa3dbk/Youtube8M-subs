00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.420
 to pixel guys if it was about time 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.080
 let's see a section dedicated to all 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.210
 your 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.099
 subscribers who have done guys have 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 made this channel continue to grow this 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.030
 channel has been known and this is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.040
 thanks to all of you and well what 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 better way to be able to thank them 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.969
 than creating a dedicated session for 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
 all of you what will worlds consist of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.020
 pixelar good the goal is that I 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.410
 visit your worlds that have at least 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 10 pixel but from a video game or a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 specific issue is to say the pixels 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.010
 they must be worked on in the video game 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
 be it pokemon be it mario bros de 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 macray final soft freddy I know 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 any videogame can choose to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.809
 create a pixel art except for 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 minecraft minecraft must be the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.060
 exception 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.870
 I do not want them to be pixels so 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.320
 because everyone 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.630
 know more pleasant design of mclaren pixel 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.370
 art and well then we have to do a side 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.440
 what it is still its most pixels 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.750
 not that they are specific videogames and 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.610
 so we enrich the culture a bit more 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
 gamer and above all it is an enrichment 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.350
 we will be here in the gamerland channel 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 because gamerland is about videogames 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.760
 in general it's worth kids and how can you 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.670
 participate very simple you have me to 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.510

 those pixelar not to recommend my 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
 recommendation is to be a video game 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.400
 specifically if you can 22 but in my 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.130
 recommendation is that it be one of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.720
 he specified vale and I'll be visiting you 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.770
