00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
attempt this so you can see that it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.410 
attempt this so you can see that it's
it's<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.830> longer<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.790> probably<00:02:12.030> checked

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's it's longer you probably checked

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's it's longer you probably checked

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
and if a text message you probably check

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.490 
and if a text message you probably check
out<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> few<00:02:17.700> videos<00:02:18.000> already<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.290> shows

out a few videos already and it shows

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.800 
out a few videos already and it shows
that<00:02:19.710> it's<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.550> bit<00:02:20.670> forward<00:02:21.300> it's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that it's it's a little bit forward it's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.540 
that it's it's a little bit forward it's
a<00:02:21.870> little<00:02:22.080> bit<00:02:22.170> back<00:02:22.350> but<00:02:23.010> other<00:02:23.340> than<00:02:23.490> that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

you know you get the honor an essay for
your<00:04:25.610> mini<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:28.250> will<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.670> to<00:04:28.970> come<00:04:29.330> there

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
your mini you will have to come there

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.670 
your mini you will have to come there
with<00:04:31.430> your<00:04:31.700> old<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:32.300> SI<00:04:33.080> what<00:04:33.320> you'll<00:04:33.470> have<00:04:33.620> to

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
with your old a SI what you'll have to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.930 
with your old a SI what you'll have to
do<00:04:35.410> because<00:04:36.410> i<00:04:36.710> thought<00:04:36.890> i<00:04:37.190> thought<00:04:37.250> i<00:04:37.490> had<00:04:37.730> to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
do because i thought i thought i had to

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.160 
do because i thought i thought i had to
attach<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.190> new<00:04:40.190> mounting<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:41.360> you

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
attach the new mounting to it but you

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.580 
attach the new mounting to it but you
can't<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.800> don't<00:04:42.860> need<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:44.320> you'll<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:45.440> to

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
can't you don't need to you'll have to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.470 
can't you don't need to you'll have to
take<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.630> o-ring<00:04:47.630> there's<00:04:48.260> an<00:04:48.410> o-ring<00:04:49.480> right

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
take the o-ring there's an o-ring right

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.520 
take the o-ring there's an o-ring right
inside<00:04:51.640> your<00:04:52.640> old<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.450> SI<00:04:53.930> you'll<00:04:54.170> have<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.350> take

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
inside your old a SI you'll have to take

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.460 
inside your old a SI you'll have to take
that<00:04:54.590> off<00:04:54.920> and<00:04:54.950> put<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> new<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:55.790> SI

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
that off and put it in the new a SI

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.140 
that off and put it in the new a SI
because<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.950> is<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.160> other<00:04:58.280> bracket<00:04:58.730> Akane

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
because this is the other bracket Akane

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.200 
because this is the other bracket Akane
with<00:05:00.700> right<00:05:01.700> here<00:05:02.680> but<00:05:03.680> uh<00:05:03.760> it<00:05:04.760> has<00:05:04.820> an<00:05:05.090> o-ring

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
with right here but uh it has an o-ring

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.500 
with right here but uh it has an o-ring
but<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:05.990> didn't<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:07.130> won't<00:05:07.340> fit<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.880> won't

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
but it didn't it it won't fit it won't

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.040 
but it didn't it it won't fit it won't
go<00:05:08.570> inside<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:10.400> mini<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.360> that's<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.960> only

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
go inside the mini so that's the only

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.070 
go inside the mini so that's the only
thing<00:05:12.410> you'll<00:05:12.620> have<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.830> do<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:13.540> seriously<00:05:14.540> it

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
thing you'll have to do and seriously it

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.780 
thing you'll have to do and seriously it
didn't<00:05:15.440> take<00:05:15.590> me<00:05:15.740> long<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.980> do<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.310> it

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
didn't take me long to do it it

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.430 
didn't take me long to do it it
literally<00:05:17.570> took<00:05:17.840> me<00:05:19.240> probably<00:05:20.240> 5<00:05:20.600> minutes<00:05:21.230> to

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
literally took me probably 5 minutes to

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.620 
literally took me probably 5 minutes to
do<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:22.580> really<00:05:22.850> does<00:05:23.030> not<00:05:23.180> take<00:05:23.390> that<00:05:23.570> long

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
do it it really does not take that long

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.760 
do it it really does not take that long
so<00:05:24.560> that's<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.580> guys<00:05:25.610> um<00:05:26.060> I<00:05:26.690> will<00:05:27.080> try<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.560> do<00:05:27.740> a
