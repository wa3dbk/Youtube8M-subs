00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.279
 the other night after so many years it is me 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.400
 happened to review of bdt one 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.590
 theatrical show by daniele luttazzi 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.950
 it was a theatrical performance of 2009 mi 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.460
 pare three cameron and I was one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.520
 moment we say dazed at the thought that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.070
 probably most of the girls 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.680
 especially very young people who follow the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 My channel is not even who it is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.849
 daniele luttazzi 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.740
 but because daniele luttazzi was 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.800
 purged from the media and television 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.070
 Italian since 2001 with some 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.840
 small incursion immediately concluded e 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 so I said to myself I make a video that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 I'll tell you this story because it is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.590
 important that this story remains 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 he had before him not to be forgotten 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.300
 especially because it is a case rather 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.699
 curious and ranieri luttazzi who is daniele 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.039
 luttazzi alive in short, we do not touch 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.649
 iron a second for luttazzi is a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.769
 great stand up comedian and a 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.840
 great showman a man of satire 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.770
 very funny but also with gods 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 very heavy content let's say not only 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.960
 at the level of perhaps bar vulgarity 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 meaning etc. but above all for those 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.390
 heavy precisely as regards 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.670
 the content aspect focused on cases 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.000
 topical and political 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.890
 what happened led a broadcast 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 much followed in the early evening that yes 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.009
 called low tv with and in 2001 alive 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 mark labor then practically 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.610
 unknown to speak to present the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.420
 his book during this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 transmission 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.320
 what do they do and mourn in first 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.689
 own evening national TV prime time 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.799
 rai tell completely 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.600
 unassailable that is, the data was also 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.140
 the sued for this won him the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.180
 cause tell completely 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 unassailable unassailable because yes 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.079
 reworked they are suitable public and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.590
 Trials of trials were not 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.390
 conjectures far- fetched 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.750
 all the real data were those 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.310
 they brought I said tell first 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.730
 evening etc 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.280
 the implications with the silvio mafia 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.530
 berlusconi during the ascent 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.810
 therefore entrepreneurial and political 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.349
 contains facts notes that go to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.090
 demonstrate these connections between 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.330
 political entrepreneurship and the mafia in a 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.230
 certainly no time frame 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.489
 inference only data therefore carried 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.230
 very clearly beyond punctual e 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.140
 understandable two episodes after the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.200
 program of luttazzi is closed on 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.720
 circle peers devils will remember 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.910
 2000 a Berlusconi Bulgarian edict 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.099
 luttazzi and biagi e are made out 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.150
 santoro of Italian television 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:01.510
 hello we forget it throwing it then 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.430
 actually on television it doesn't come back 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.280
 that is, it returns a very short period in the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.720
 2007 with a transmission on la7 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.130
 and then he is censored again 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.889
 continued to do shows 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.870
 theatricals continued to write books 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:24.459
 in short but he never came back in 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.530
 television even in 2007 of 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.900
 new shelter domina 9 I don't remember pippo 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.060
 baudo offered him conduction 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.840
 sanremo festival to find a way 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.819
 to get him back on television and 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.190
 threw out refused saying I did 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.049
 scimmietta a sanremo does not lava to do 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.930
 I want to talk about certain topics that 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.090
 they are political etcetera etc. church 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.769
 etc. etc. then the monkey 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.750
 trained the festival of sanremo 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.090
 make someone else do it with great 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.959
 dignity because I think it is not from 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.200
 all 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.880
 refuse to run the festival 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.530
 money guys here is that is not alone 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.859
 visibility but also money so it's one 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.910
 figure that I personally admire I admire 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.689
 much for this consistency even to who it is 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.400
 demonstrated and above all I would like 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.850
 convey this story to the story of 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.250
 these 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.190
 because actually luttazzi not yes 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.260
 is more heard of is also enough 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.110
 unworthy to live in a country where it exists 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.270
 a complaint of this kind 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.060
 what the new generations are doing 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.130
 pulling on television have satire 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.600
 at the most of crozza 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.010
 but if they don't leave they say to him 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.220
 that doesn't hurt that much 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.840
 same thing they said the new ones 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.120
 generations have an idea that satire it 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840
 politics is the one that makes the strip 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.910
 news 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.280
 that is, I saw another one 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.590
 day strip the news and took 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.540
 around berlusconi for the capacious but 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.520
 taking around Berlusconi for i 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.860
 hair gets its game because you go 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.230
 to increase the charisma of a character 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.690
 of a figure etcetera etc. we go to 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.460
 make a physical defect 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.070
 the king guarantee that luttazzi will not 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.590
 put to shame physical flaws but 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.220
 he spoke of political facts and for this 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.890
 reason was not right and they cut it 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.770
 here I hope one day to live in 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.830
 a country in which the rates can return to 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.030
 television and with this wish with 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.390
 this wish 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.730
 I greet you let me know what you think 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.920
 both in television censorship and 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.290
 this case your impressions in 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.730
 what ever I will try to do it too 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.980
 somehow have this video 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.520
 so if you want to write something too 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.440
 for him 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.440
 put it in the comments
