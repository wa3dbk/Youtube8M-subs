00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.480
 it was a car accident nothing 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.510
 particularly remarkable but fatal 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.210
 no doubt you left a wife and two 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.300
 children the paramedics did their best 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.270
 effort to bring you back but not 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.930
 there was nothing to do 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.050
 your body was totally destroyed 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.129
 it was better so believe me 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.800
 and then you saw me your email 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.400
 you asked where I am 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.820
 you died, I told you once there is no 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.760
 what to beat around the bush was a truck 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.540
 and it was getting out of the way a 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.100
 shock I died but do not feel bad for 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.850
 that all die 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.960
 look around there was nothing just you and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 What is this place you asked me is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.340
 what there is after life more or 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.600
 less I answered you are god yes I am 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.740
 I told you for your stupefaction my children 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.049
 my wife and they will be fine with me 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.580
 like that you just died and your biggest 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.400
 worry is your family that's good 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.910
 you looked at me fascinated for you I did not see 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.040
 as god I looked like any man 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.390
 some vague authority figure plus a 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.470
 grammar teacher that the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.479
 almighty do not worry I told you 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.010
 will be fine your children will remember you 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.170
 as someone perfect in all 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.080
 senses did not have time to 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.880
 keep some grudge your wife is 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.210
 will regret in public but secretly 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.790
 feeling relieved to be honest 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.070
 marriage was falling apart if you 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.320
 it serves as a comfort you will feel very 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.450
 guilty for feeling relieved 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.690
 so what happens now I can go to 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.460
 heaven or hell or something like that to none 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.130
 to portray yourself as the go murmur 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.740
 Hindus were right all religions 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.940
 they had some reason in their way come 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.680
 with me 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.040
 you kept asking while we were walking 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.170
 through the vacuum where we are going nowhere 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.720
 in particular it 's nice to walk 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.050
 while we talk and what would be the point 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.970
 of this no delay is in asking 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.150
 When I 'm reborn I'll be like a blackboard 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.280
 white not a baby and so all my 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.880
 experience and what I did in this life 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.770
 it will not matter you're wrong you have with you 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.990
 the knowledge and experiences of all 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.140
 your past lives just that you do not 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.690
 you remember right now pairs of walking and 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.150
 I take you by the shoulders your soul is more 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.670
 beautiful gorgeous and giant of what you 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 can you imagine a human mind can 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.070
 contain only a fraction of what 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.070
 you are like putting your finger in a glass of 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.330
 water to see if it's hot or cold 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.120
 you put a small part of you in the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.790
 glass and when you remove it you get all 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.730
 the experience I had has been a 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.510
 human for the past 34 years in these 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.640
 instants 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.460
 you can not feel the rest of your immense 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.710
 conscience but if we stay here 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.710
 for longer I would begin to remember 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.440
 all clear that it would not make sense to do 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.980
 that every life I guess you'll have 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.580
 reincarnated infinity of times or if 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.230
 many times and in many different lives 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.070
 this time reincarnate like that in a peasant 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.910
 china of the year 540 after christ not 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.580
 that stutters this will send me to the past 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.010
 as long as technically 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.350
 know only exists in your universe the 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.800
 things are different from where I come from 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.949
 where are you coming curious 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.259
 then of course I started to explain yourself 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.620
 from somewhere a place other than this 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.750
 where there are others like me I know you'll want 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.810
 know how it is there but honestly not 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.970
 you would understand you were somewhat disappointed 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.580
 but in that case he was reincarnated in other 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.830
 places and times could interact 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.470
 with myself at some safe time 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 it happens all the time with both lives 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.539
 just worried about their own existence 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.139
 you never realize what would be the 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.330
 point reiterase you tell me seriously 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.879
 questions about the meaning of life do not 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.780
 it seems very trite to you is a question 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:07.050
 Reasonable you insisted I looked you in the eyes 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.360
 the meaning of life the reason why 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.030
 that I made this great universe is so that 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.620
 maturity you mean the human race 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.840
 you want us to mature not only did you do 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.719
 this universe for you with every nine 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.509
 lives mature and mature and increases its 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:26.110
 intellect that there is of others there is no 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.720
 nobody else 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.110
 in this universe there is nothing more than 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.210
 you and I to go exists but all the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.640
 People of the Earth 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.910

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.880
 You wait, I'm all, now you're going 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.490
 understanding I told you with a pat of 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.910

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.850

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.420

 self-conscious and you are the millions he killed 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.630
 I am Jesus and you are each one of those who 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.100
 believe in him you were silent every time 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.100
 what victims of someone 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.630
 I started from victims you to you every act of 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.940
 goodness that you have done you did it to you 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.350
 same every happy and sad moment that has 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.280
 been experienced by any being 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:21.360
 human was or will be experienced by you 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.220
 because because one day you will be like me 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.360

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.460
 is not yet a fetus you will continue to grow 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.410
 Once you have lived each human life in 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.780
 all possible times now is 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.710
 he grew enough to be born then 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.500
 the whole universe you told me is a 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.990
 kind of egg I answered you now is 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.090
 time to go to your next life and with 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.090
 that sends you to your destination
