car photography is notoriously difficult

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.679 
car photography is notoriously difficult
from<00:00:25.859> shooting<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.550> shutter<00:00:27.119> speed<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.420> five

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
from shooting a shutter speed of five

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.570 
from shooting a shutter speed of five
hundredths<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> second<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.920> cut<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
hundredths of a second to cut out the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:44.750 
hundredths of a second to cut out the
ambient<00:00:30.330> daylight<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.840> we've<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.170> here

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.520 

okay<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:46.059> gold<00:00:46.510> card<00:00:46.870> has<00:00:47.170> made<00:00:47.500> a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
okay so that gold card has made a

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.470 
okay so that gold card has made a
dramatic<00:00:47.829> improvement<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.000> color<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.420> the

dramatic improvement to the color of the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.439 
dramatic improvement to the color of the
liquid<00:00:49.840> down<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.260> side<00:00:50.559> here<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.180> what

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
liquid down this side here right so what

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.110 
liquid down this side here right so what
we've<00:00:58.570> got<00:00:58.600> here<00:00:59.199> is<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.430> can<00:01:00.580> see<00:01:00.910> this

we've got here is you can see this
lovely<00:01:01.800> gradation<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.890> light<00:01:03.160> I'll<00:01:03.730> start<00:01:04.180> off

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
lovely gradation of light I'll start off

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.330 
lovely gradation of light I'll start off
testing<00:01:04.989> my<00:01:05.080> exposure<00:01:05.440> with<00:01:05.680> just<00:01:05.860> one<00:01:06.100> light

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
testing my exposure with just one light

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.900 
testing my exposure with just one light
then<00:01:06.670> add<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.030> second<00:01:07.420> light<00:01:11.640> next<00:01:12.640> up<00:01:12.790> we're

I've got a honeycomb grid and I've got

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.010 
I've got a honeycomb grid and I've got
an<00:01:30.190> 18<00:01:30.580> millimeter<00:01:30.730> lens<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.660> Hasselblad

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
I've got a line running across the front

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.620 
I've got a line running across the front
surfaces<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.760> lipstick<00:01:39.760> on<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.180> blue

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.730 
okay so you can see our products now
illuminated<00:01:58.149> by<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.329> main<00:01:58.539> softbox<00:01:59.079> that<00:01:59.500> is

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
illuminated by the main softbox that is

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.950 
illuminated by the main softbox that is
a<00:01:59.770> PAC<00:02:00.070> shot<00:02:00.399> that's<00:02:00.880> how<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.179> do<00:02:01.360> them<00:02:01.689> quickly

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
a PAC shot that's how I do them quickly

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.449 
a PAC shot that's how I do them quickly
and<00:02:02.409> effectively<00:02:07.739> there's<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.800> much<00:02:09.009> smaller

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
and effectively there's a much smaller

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.300 
and effectively there's a much smaller
item<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.239> you're<00:02:10.390> dealing<00:02:10.630> with<00:02:11.140> light<00:02:11.980> and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
item so you're dealing with light and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.150 
item so you're dealing with light and
reflections<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.239> very<00:02:13.660> small<00:02:13.870> places<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
reflections in very small places and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.400 
reflections in very small places and
increments<00:02:15.700> which<00:02:16.239> requires<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.989> use<00:02:17.170> of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
increments which requires the use of

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:52.610 
increments which requires the use of
mirrors<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.160> clever<00:02:18.760> positioning

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.670 

growing<00:02:53.620> paint<00:02:54.510> towards<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.689> camera

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
growing paint towards the camera

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.329
