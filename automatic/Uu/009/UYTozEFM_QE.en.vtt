works okay you can tilt it up or down
however<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.730> want<00:00:13.009> back<00:00:14.009> behind<00:00:14.250> here

however you want back behind here
there's<00:00:15.450> little<00:00:15.719> set<00:00:16.080> screws<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.770> believe

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
there's little set screws that I believe

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.370 
there's little set screws that I believe
will<00:00:17.520> clamp<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.060> down<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.750> tighter<00:00:19.020> so

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
will clamp this down a little tighter so

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.800 
will clamp this down a little tighter so
it<00:00:19.470> doesn't<00:00:19.740> wiggle<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.100> ya

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
it doesn't wiggle on ya

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.320 
it doesn't wiggle on ya
um<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.710> dead<00:00:23.609> center<00:00:24.119> on

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
um as you can see it's dead center on

the hitch so backing up two trailers by

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
the hitch so backing up two trailers by
yourself<00:00:31.080> should<00:00:31.529> work<00:00:32.070> pretty<00:00:32.610> decent<00:00:35.270> image

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
yourself should work pretty decent image

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
yourself should work pretty decent image
on<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.660> pretty<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:39.620> got<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> vehicle

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
right here that's kitty corner I would

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.209 
right here that's kitty corner I would
say<00:00:44.539> bumper<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> bumper<00:00:46.100> maybe<00:00:47.100> 10<00:00:47.399> feet<00:00:47.670> away

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
say bumper to bumper maybe 10 feet away

there's the display right there we're
getting<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> reflection<00:00:59.129> going

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
getting a little bit of reflection going

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
getting a little bit of reflection going
on<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:01.309> there's<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.550> ways<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:03.049> hook<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
on but there's two ways to hook up the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.920 
on but there's two ways to hook up the
rear<00:01:04.769> view<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.310> an<00:01:08.490> image<00:01:08.700> one's<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.659> auto

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
rear view to get an image one's an auto

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
rear view to get an image one's an auto
it<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> automatically<00:01:11.460> senses<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.000> video

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it kind of automatically senses a video

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.130 
it kind of automatically senses a video
feed<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.830> display<00:01:14.250> I'll<00:01:14.369> kick<00:01:14.610> on

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
car right over here that's approximately

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
car right over here that's approximately
10<00:01:30.780> feet<00:01:30.810> away<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.530> also<00:01:31.650> gives<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> parking

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
10 feet away it also gives you parking

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.140 
10 feet away it also gives you parking
assist<00:01:32.909> lines<00:01:33.500> right<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.850> you've<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:35.939> two

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
assist lines right here you've got two

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.410 
assist lines right here you've got two
yellows<00:01:37.250> they're<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> tapered<00:01:39.060> n-words

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
yellows they're kind of tapered n-words

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980 
yellows they're kind of tapered n-words
and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.729> looks<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> red<00:01:42.240> blue<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and then looks like a red blue and a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
and then looks like a red blue and a
green<00:01:43.320> line<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:45.180> judge<00:01:45.450> distance<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
green line to judge distance so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.350 
green line to judge distance so
otherwise<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.450> mean<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.579> looks<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:50.670> factory

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
otherwise I mean it looks pretty factory

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.950 
otherwise I mean it looks pretty factory
which<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> wanted<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.180> then

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
which is kind of what I wanted and then

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.600 
which is kind of what I wanted and then
the<00:01:55.079> mirror<00:01:55.350> also<00:01:55.710> auto<00:01:55.950> dims<00:01:56.509> at<00:01:57.509> night<00:01:58.610> which

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the mirror also auto dims at night which

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.920 
the mirror also auto dims at night which
is<00:01:59.640> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> nice<00:02:01.009> so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
is kind of nice so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.390 
is kind of nice so
that's<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.320> gonna<00:02:05.409> try<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.770> manually

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
that's it I'm gonna try it manually

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.660 
that's it I'm gonna try it manually
switching<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.630> off<00:02:07.720> for<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:08.220> Tom<00:02:09.220> if<00:02:09.489> I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
switching it on and off for now Tom if I

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.449 
switching it on and off for now Tom if I
find<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.300> kind<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.660> pain<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.890> it's

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
find that it's kind of a pain then it's

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.930 
find that it's kind of a pain then it's
just<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.819> matter<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.319> flip-flopping<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:15.580> video

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
just a matter of flip-flopping my video

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.860 
just a matter of flip-flopping my video
wires<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.750> will<00:02:17.670> Auto<00:02:18.750> sense<00:02:19.750> video<00:02:20.230> and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
wires so it will Auto sense video and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.110 
wires so it will Auto sense video and
and<00:02:22.870> kick<00:02:23.709> over<00:02:23.890> automatically<00:02:24.700> when<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:24.850> throw

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
and kick over automatically when I throw

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.830 
and kick over automatically when I throw
it<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.270> reverse

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
it in reverse

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.019 
it in reverse
so<00:02:27.030> installation<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.180> pretty<00:02:28.540> easy
