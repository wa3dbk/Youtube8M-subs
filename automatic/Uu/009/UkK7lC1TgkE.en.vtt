00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 then at least lie to us 400 meters that is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.099
 card is less but the probability that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 The highlights will not be extremely high either. 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 when another literally one of the most 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 small cards 600 by 600 meters map 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 Ensk is a bit like a rival 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.939
 not far but the railway 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.060
 10-year-old canvases they just blow up 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 many teams mind as they say 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.199
 drove the second card write guy 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.809
 active game us yes of course everything will be me 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.170
 I just want to say that I am wagging something but 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.390
 it could be info 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 so just observe that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.180
 going on with us now let's 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 look after these comrades 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 who create action pack 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.840
 Well, of course technology is not particularly say 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 worth donated 50100 remind all the same by 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 2 is a third two t1 here again 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480
 standard nobody risks even here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800
 the bottom base somehow already tied 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.780
 take 3 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.960
 not from the third and generally go somehow 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 so the city well what was the light 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.220
 small saw without mixing well 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.530
 player already in the loopholes but they saw that 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.510
 which is at least a couple 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 players to the team na'vi already sent 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 on a trip to the left well and stripe there 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 added acceleration to him there with a projectile 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.549
 quickly on the greens went even there all 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 the na'vi teams tried to get sick 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.350
 acceleration saw strike and whom there 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 a little bit sped up someone from the team this 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.600
 on my corner clear up 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.509
 378 here it is not the best alpha but 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.250
 at least something important to damage and this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.210
 initial damage to the tank 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 quantity to smaller than the rest 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.880
 do not forgive at all there is a phase of light 3 even 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.159
 already have damage so this card is already at 10 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.189
 once again steeply re-hungarian infinite 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.380
 number of times more is a victory it is already 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.329
 victory well then we understand guys but you 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.130
 should perfectly understand that the farther 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.020
 the more interesting we have to perry to sweat but 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.079
 last there are three three cards + 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.630
 6 card opportunity here will be 6 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.630
 cards and since we're there for a bagel 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.070
 walked through the article yes then we get but I 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.780
 foreshadowed 2 tie breaks all the same in 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.060
 end of the 2 ends 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.009
 guessed and we only saw one and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.870
 here is my last hope for that mean 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.760
 there will still be this sandy river right here and 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.620
 now we will arrange there on the stage after the matches 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.940
 Okay, give it a good look at all 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.370
 what is happening on the map 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.739
 here are some interesting moments 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 Likely here now I sip along 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.430
 this comrade here is also something though 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.430
 what tool does he have this comrade 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.340
 always loves experimenting this time without 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.070
 experiments cost yes everything is fine 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.880
 here though the question is still something for him 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.989
 bigger experiment 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:50.730
 Oh by the way yes happens in different ways so 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.580
 guys again everything is very calm here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.890
 such a beginning is promising and loudly 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.290
 seen only begin to tell 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.620
 tanks jokes look instagram though 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:07.769
 would not know what can be in the picture with this 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.110
 from twitter in the end maybe of course 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.269
 and the battle on this map 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.950
 theoretically give inspect think here 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.489
 the same situation can happen on 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.829
 cliff 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.780
 but if na'vi doesn't want to try pro 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.760
 on any map can be such inside 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.650
 ethically given on each card such 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.170
 maybe ondar your fight is nobody's option 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.620
 principle why take advantage of 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.600
 this time the judges were more cunning 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.100
 removed additional cards that is 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.290
 end of all ends we are in regular time 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.959
 We look but if everyone plays for a draw, then 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790
 not 7 for 5 cards but secondly of course 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.130
 This is the ending I think not one 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.959
 second team nobody wants it 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.900
 wants to tie break nobody wants to storm on 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.310
 sandy river I think they do not want but they 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.150
 they probably want to play defense 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.519
 let's say it so somewhere for uni bye 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.560
 all good wait for the fucking unity 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.209
 great chance at all in fact if 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.709
 water here will not work and there will not work 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:05.459
 win by sight why not drag it 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:07.170
 I already play in the operator 100 to unity already 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.820
 selects respawn in fact really 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.609
 have not taken the first step in this 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.110
 boevku expensive and they went to the front of the house 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.720
 how much will I say now 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.410
 on the 378 kind ahead the team love here 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.959
 so notice well and so still here 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.540
 run a couple of cards from your opponents 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.730
 and it can be appended to throw it and running away 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:32.130
 in this case there is no joke but 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:36.600
 of course cliff mines at the end of it 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.370
 Further Khimki so back to the map where 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.370
 unity 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.640
 most likely everyone will choose this unlikely 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.120
 whether 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:49.560
 spawn group now on the team idea 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.370
 played top respawn so i am now 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.580
 understandable navi lower base and for sure 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.860
 chose now once full Khimki no catch 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.960
 lower base will be 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:09.150
 mines unity upper base cliff mari 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:14.130
 the upper base here and now we can 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.580
 think about himmelsdorf cliff 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.070
 top is interesting the last map 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.290
 pay attention to the top unity mines 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.400
 base catch the bottom but basically we'll see 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.060
 then probably 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.990
 6 5-7 minutes it will take guys 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.540
 himmelsdorf on venice too by the way here 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.150
 I wonder what to do unity is yes 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.810
 About this map 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.310
 interested in 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.220
 was also invented there a little bit like that 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.210
 here's an interesting choice after all 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.280
 most navi maps tried to do 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.590
 uncomfortable probably all the same base for 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.500
 guys with unity team 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.680
 axes and on himmelsdorf so that they are not there 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.990
 tightly defended we will protect as they can 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.390
 do at the bottom base so principle 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.180
 you are interested in the game will be one hundred percent 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.310
 but for now, here are the first two cards 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.410
 just a masterpiece and I do not know that's what 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.520
 tougher it was today 1 Descartes either 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.990
 12 discs of the first season in a row 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.630
 brutality of course the first card 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.230
 today we get 1 card today 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.230
 pocket 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.450
 I liked her. to that question map 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:26.910
 no questions there 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:30.390
 where is the damage where is the lesson where did he come from 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:33.120
 how so well started 58 seconds 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.230
 the timer again for red is not it 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.690
 the machine gunner is there with the total 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.210
 but for this he basically shot 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.420
 topaz to see its traditions 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.480
 violated to light bulb worked end 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.860
 end of the PACE struggle here see 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.600
 here I really think 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.010
 more interesting things happen than here 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.290
 such situations you of course 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.450
 the director we will not fail he showed 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.980
 that everything is fine here you can see 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.100
 on the other guys wah live side 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.050
 look so what happens there by 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.380
 party principle there should plentiful 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:12.510
 The situation should hands off the keyboard removed 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.620
 even after all, comrade for a long time alex as 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.330
 always gives things there 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.280
 tells and tells you to lead 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.460
 team last seconds process 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.220
 controls geodon hello where is ah 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.200
 such an advantage was all now 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.720
 advantage over the damage we have friends 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.730
 now they choose the side well here in 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.490
 such a situation we can lamplight mod 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.190
 all is not necessary even well all navi 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.260
 played all the respawn already fine now 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.180
 You can three boxes of light all the food. 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.480
 rushed a good house ok everything a 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.480
 before
