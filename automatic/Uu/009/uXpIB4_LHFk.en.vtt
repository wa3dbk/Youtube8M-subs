00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.310
 taste and taste in a short time simple 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.080
 thanks to today's recipe scallops 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 of veal scented with sage and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.940
 rosemary along with caramelized staircases 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.940
 you will see that it will be child's play 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.940
 let's begin 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.659
 Hey 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:40.920
 beginning with the cleaning of the stairs that 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:44.039
 I will then have to caramelize then remove 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.109
 the end in wine also the peel 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.190
 external 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.190
 I divide the airport by 12 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.410
 and it continues in exactly the same way 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 with everyone else 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.650
 then I proceed with the aromatic herbs I have 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.950
 chosen rosemary and sage 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.230
 I remove the workers from the woody part e 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.230
 then I also take sage leaves 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.430
 for this recipe I chose meat 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.500
 of veal as you see the slice rather 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.270
 long cut in half so 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.840
 get a couple of small scallops a 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.840
 head 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.170
 then I'm going to flour my slices up 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.550
 both sides 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 if you are gluten intolerant then 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.820
 flour your slices with the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.870
 corn starch potato starch 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.870
 rice flour 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.939
 ok i do the exact same thing with le 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.939
 other slices 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.130
 in this pan as you see I put a 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.570
 drop of oil and bad luck to brown 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.000
 I want them to become beautiful golden in 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.610
 meanwhile in this other tega le 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.860
 I add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 olive is a small piece of butter 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.810
 I let the butter melt 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.810
 and then they put on explaining my slices 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.030
 which I will let well brown on both 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.030
 sides 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.350
 meanwhile tour triggers grandparents 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.610
 check you have found me inside can 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.260
 add a little vegetable stock 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.260
 so very light 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.360
 cover with the lid and cook 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.800
 for at least 10 15 minutes this depends 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.090
 much from the size of the thickness 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.740
 of the shallot 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.870
 but then just a bucket with one 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.670
 fork to notice if it is 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.490
 cooked no 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.410
 now I can turn the slices too 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.410
 it will be enough that they become slightly golden 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.950
 I add the other tits 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.810
 obviously the meat is a culture yes 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.670
 narrows leaves room for other meat 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.200
 once browned well on both 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.420
 the sides I'm going to put in a saucer 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.420
 because then we will proceed with the sauce 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:58.330
 the meat as you can see is well browned now 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.330
 I take all the slices out of the pan 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.180
 which I then go to put back on the fire 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.180
 I also add some chopped herbs 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.020
 I lightly brown it with 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.880
 the oil so that they emanate from Rome 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.720
 and now I pour out some wine to give a 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.720
 pinch of a city 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.090
 let it evaporate in the meantime add 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 even a pinch of salt 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.930
 it's a bit of pepper 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.630
 I'm preparing an excellent sauce of 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.580
 accompaniment for our escalopes 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.990
 which then if he wins once he aims at 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.880
 put the scallops inside the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.020
 pan because the flour does this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.340
 effect 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.340
 I add a goccino of broth 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.060
 when the boiling resumes I can 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 add the meat to the pan 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.620
 lower the flame because now everything is 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.760
 ready cooked meat of the only ones 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.760
 blend with the aforementioned 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.970
 I add only a bit of herbs 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.970
 aromatic is a pinch of salt 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:18.980
 here are my shallots half-cooked and 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:23.720
 I go to add salt and honey a 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.900
 another goccino of broth and finish the 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.900
 cooking 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.259
 and in the meantime how we see all the 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.159
