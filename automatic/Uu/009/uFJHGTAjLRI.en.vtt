 defendants and the most typical that is 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.310

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.260

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.510
 if you think so we proceed to elaborate 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.410
 this comes from a cow of 35 years of 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.600
 life that has already taken about 30 days 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.309
 of healing in the refrigerator and that's 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.180

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.180
 to be consumed 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 then proceed with the chop 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.810
 we have the false with the high temperature 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.090
 to facilitate us 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.370
 and the chop is done we do not remove a 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.370
 little iron after the same animal 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.460
 we take the chop 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.400
 or the stain as a service always to a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.830
 very high temperature to facilitate a 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.290
 good seal to this bone found 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.580
 do not miss facilitate juice 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.500
 meat that maintains all its properties 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.240
 and we also add fat salt and now 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.729
 from the beginning 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.540
 to retain hold the juices 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.450
 of one's own flesh has this form 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.950
 we can enjoy this meat 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.950
 with all its virtues 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.119
 and we left her there for a few minutes and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.509
 we will turn around once the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.509
 part 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.620
 We continue with cutlet good we 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 to proceed to turn it around so that the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.569
 another face is also made 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 and thirdly as the first 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.560
 and this mentally low also here in this 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.010
 side so you have also played as you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.010
 did before 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.660
 and soon the chop will be ready to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.660
 eat 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.909
 sometimes the chop 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.409
 I consider that the view is already 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.409
 take out to chop and eat 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.370
 when we got there to cut the table 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.769
 we already have a dish that hot 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.340
 to serve it usually have to so 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.340
 keep the temperature 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.800
 then we touched it a little bit 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.030
 inside we see that it is hot to 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.580
 this the chop must also be 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.890
 also fully tempered which 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.680
 it means that you can not get out either 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.370
 chop the fridge and put it to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.480
 Grill 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.000
 So, take out one hour before 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.050
 similar to cold and so the effect 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 of the iron because you do this 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.830
 this can be done by anyone in 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.100
 your house quietly with a 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.100
 griddle 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.150
 Hello 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.760

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.760
 Salt 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.150
 a few chips are enough 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.740
 those that you like 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.850
