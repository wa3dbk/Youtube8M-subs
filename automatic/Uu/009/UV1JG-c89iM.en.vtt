flavor which I like

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.530 
flavor which I like
I do<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.860> protein<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.270> super

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
I do not like protein that are super

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
I do not like protein that are super
overpowering<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.260> hard<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.770> drink<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
overpowering and hard to drink so it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.780 
overpowering and hard to drink so it's
really<00:02:24.700> easy<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:25.240> drink<00:02:25.450> um<00:02:26.400> kind<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.610> thick
