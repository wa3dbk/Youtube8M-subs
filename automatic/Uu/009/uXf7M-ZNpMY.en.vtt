00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
this a wall jack or something I guess as

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.399 
this a wall jack or something I guess as
well<00:03:09.930> as<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.250> transmitter<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.489> probably

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
well as the transmitter this is probably

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.099 
well as the transmitter this is probably
one<00:03:13.409> of<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.590> key<00:03:13.769> things<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:15.269> got<00:03:15.599> it

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
one of the key things in this we got it

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.280 
one of the key things in this we got it
a<00:03:16.319> little<00:03:16.560> closed<00:03:16.709> loop<00:03:17.900> now<00:03:18.900> if<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:19.139> turn

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
a little closed loop now if we turn

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.979 
a little closed loop now if we turn
around<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.889> can<00:03:20.639> see<00:03:20.669> it's<00:03:21.510> kind<00:03:21.659> of<00:03:21.689> dark<00:03:21.900> but

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
I really like this design because if the

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.140

cord<00:07:04.720> breaks<00:07:05.050> or<00:07:05.260> something<00:07:05.370> if<00:07:06.370> you<00:07:06.520> have<00:07:06.700> one

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
cord breaks or something if you have one

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.030 
cord breaks or something if you have one
