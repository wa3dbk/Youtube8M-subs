00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.039 
because the star that ruled you got the
one<00:04:13.260> Stardust<00:04:13.560> Dragon<00:04:14.630> only<00:04:15.630> synchro<00:04:15.959> you're

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
one Stardust Dragon only synchro you're

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.560 
one Stardust Dragon only synchro you're
going<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.230> run<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:17.400> one<00:04:17.989> Leviathan<00:04:18.989> dragon

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
going to run the one Leviathan dragon

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.930 
going to run the one Leviathan dragon
I<00:04:19.660> prefer<00:04:20.530> Leviathan<00:04:21.100> over<00:04:21.310> acid<00:04:21.850> golem

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
I prefer Leviathan over acid golem

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.700 
I prefer Leviathan over acid golem
because<00:04:22.390> he<00:04:22.600> can<00:04:22.750> detach<00:04:22.960> exists<00:04:23.350> material

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
because he can detach exists material

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.600 
because he can detach exists material
faster<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.060> makes<00:04:25.240> him<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:26.430> guess<00:04:27.430> more

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
faster so it makes him I guess more

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.820 
faster so it makes him I guess more
versatile<00:04:28.090> in<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.360> sense<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.870> he<00:04:29.410> can<00:04:29.650> reach

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
versatile in that sense and he can reach

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.210
