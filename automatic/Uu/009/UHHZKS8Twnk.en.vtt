the<00:02:44.450> cash<00:02:44.689> register

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.680 

I<00:02:49.769> think<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.519> cute

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.910 

um

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:11.680 

let's<00:03:03.430> try<00:03:03.610> shooting<00:03:03.940> him

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.870 

do<00:03:12.290> not<00:03:12.530> try<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.920> hit<00:03:13.070> him<00:03:13.340> with<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:13.550> cash

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
do not try to hit him with a cash

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.940 
do not try to hit him with a cash
register<00:03:14.120> without<00:03:14.630> throwing<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.500> because

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
register without throwing it because

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.190 
register without throwing it because
then<00:03:16.340> he<00:03:16.580> will<00:03:16.730> easily<00:03:17.060> just<00:03:17.710> chop<00:03:18.710> you<00:03:18.950> up

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
then he will easily just chop you up

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.050 
then he will easily just chop you up
just<00:03:21.200> keep<00:03:21.530> throwing<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:22.100> cash<00:03:22.310> register<00:03:23.030> and

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
just keep throwing the cash register and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.150 
just keep throwing the cash register and
if<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.420> miss<00:03:23.660> again<00:03:24.080> like<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.740> said<00:03:24.770> you<00:03:25.130> can
