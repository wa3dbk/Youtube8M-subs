00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.009
 7:13 hello eric zemmour in day 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.299
 spoke in the joint is Ã©cotaxe 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.250
 insisted in recent days to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.970
 very violent scenes in Brittany 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.110
 that we present 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 traditionally as a land 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.549
 moderate how do you explain yourself eric 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.880
 this wind of revolt blowing on the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.279
 region 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.660
 it's the story of a disenchantment between 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 Brittany and Europe 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 the idyll seemed eternal 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 brittany had given yes franc and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 massive with the two European referendums of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.619
 92 and 2005 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 hardly or no one voted for the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 national front it is true that the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 brittany was the land of France where 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.460
 there were the fewest immigrants 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 the advantage of being far from everything since 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.629
 late 70s Brittany had little 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.850
 little drowned his vibrant Catholicism of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.559
 formerly in a social democracy at the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 Germanic fashion serious work and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.610
 fair social negotiations between the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.800
 Catholicism and socialism after all 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.539
 it was the same universalism beyond 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460
 nations and the same compassion for 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 the skins and then the bretons were 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 not unhappy to find with europe 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.430
 a contact who beat down the bedroom 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.840
 and from that French state he had 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 always struggled to endure 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.610
 the Parisian arrogance europe it was 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.350
 Brittany in large but in the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.909
 cuts said balzac there is always 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 one who is bored and one who is suffering 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.790
 so what happened is 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.350
 what broke between the Bretons and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.360
 europe is europe that wanted to see 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.909
 elsewhere see bigger or even more crazy 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.619
 the customs union of the six threw itself 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.119
 body lost in globalization for 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.960
 become a vast free trade area 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.360
 to 27 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.340
 open to 80 the solidarity model 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.900
 of Rhenish inspiration was thrown by 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.670
 above the mills for the benefit of the neo 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.619
 Anglo-Saxon liberalism of the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.030
 free and undistorted competition on 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.470
 sharing roles between France and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 Germany imposed by the General of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 gaulle to france agriculture to 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.079
 Germany's industry has become 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.970
 obsolete with German reunification 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.079
 the agricultural lands of Prussia itself 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.360
 are covered with huge 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.040
 of highly mechanized farms 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.540
 Romanian workers were made to work 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.329
 thousands for poverty wages 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.740
 in Germany there is no minimum wage and not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.090
 social charges either for these 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.350
 Romanian people who are brought to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.329
 agrifood factories for 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 to work instead of Breton thanks 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 to the European directive on 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.369
 secondment of employees to europe is 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.710
 formidable she invented the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.479
 relocation near home says 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.280
 to the Bretons they must give up 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.379
 their productivist model that pollute 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.879
 overly soil and german 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.530
 do even bigger and even more 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.450
 productive ischios and that 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.340
 to say Brazilian latifundia that we 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 send industrial chicken but not 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.450
 dear short one makes fun of them and the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.160
 bretons do not like being mocked by them 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.680
 but they could not go after 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.420
 German it was already Germanophobic 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.590
 they fought with the workers 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 Romanian people and they were treated 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.370
 xenophobic and brussels is too far 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.560
 for him to make throats 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.150
 European Commissioners then only remains 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.709
 that the French state these socialists 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.350
 all the more clumsy they are 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.120
 useless and helpless their eco tax is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.720
 the drop of water that broke the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 vase 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.860
 the bretons are now like 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.540
 the other French imploring the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.489
 protection of a state that has 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.440
 voluntarily stripped of his means 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.050
 of protection then when a people 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.350
 implores in vain sometimes he becomes 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.850
 violent 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.769
 thank you very much and reese and me we are you 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.410
 found in podcast on rtl.fr and then 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.430
 we will come back at 7:30 on these elements that 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.410
 trace information 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.700
 generals so that they take the pulse 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.660
 anger right now in Brittany 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.980
 but also in other regions with 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.640
 a strong identity will be in the newspaper 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.640
 just now to reindeer
