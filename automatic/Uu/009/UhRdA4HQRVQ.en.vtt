brain that's causing the seizures now

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.910 
brain that's causing the seizures now
unfortunately<00:01:07.360> this<00:01:08.350> surgery<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:08.830> only

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
unfortunately this surgery is only

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.070 
unfortunately this surgery is only
effective<00:01:09.340> about<00:01:09.550> 50%<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.540> time<00:01:10.570> and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
effective about 50% of the time and

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.050 
effective about 50% of the time and
that's<00:01:11.680> because<00:01:12.070> finding<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.610> source<00:01:12.880> of

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
that's because finding the source of

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.150 
that's because finding the source of
these<00:01:13.150> seizures<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.860> incredibly<00:01:14.860> difficult

in<00:01:18.370> our<00:01:18.460> head<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.850> finding<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> relatively

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
in our head and finding the relatively

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.650 
in our head and finding the relatively
few<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:21.340> are<00:01:21.460> causing<00:01:21.790> these<00:01:21.880> seizures<00:01:22.090> is<00:01:22.420> a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
few that are causing these seizures is a

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.760 
few that are causing these seizures is a
huge<00:01:23.110> task

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
that's where my project comes in we take

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.460 
that's where my project comes in we take
two<00:01:27.210> traditional<00:01:28.210> methods<00:01:28.630> for<00:01:29.080> imaging

technique is called intracranial EEG
this<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.490> where<00:01:39.640> electrodes<00:01:40.090> are<00:01:40.180> placed

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
this is where electrodes are placed

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.960 
this is where electrodes are placed
directly<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.680> surface<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.190> brain<00:01:42.310> to

directly on the surface of the brain to

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.400 
directly on the surface of the brain to

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
tissue underneath now each is so useful

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.810 
tissue underneath now each is so useful
for<00:01:47.050> studying<00:01:47.410> epilepsy<00:01:47.890> because<00:01:48.340> even<00:01:48.730> when

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
but what EEG can tell us is exactly

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.810

kind of gives us a general localization

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.560 
kind of gives us a general localization
that's<00:02:03.580> where<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.790> second<00:02:04.120> technique<00:02:04.390> comes

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
that's where the second technique comes

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.930 
that's where the second technique comes
in<00:02:04.780> functional<00:02:05.680> magnetic<00:02:05.890> resonance<00:02:06.220> imaging

fMRI<00:02:07.170> which<00:02:08.170> shows<00:02:08.470> us<00:02:08.739> which<00:02:09.220> areas<00:02:09.519> of<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
fMRI which shows us which areas of the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.360 
fMRI which shows us which areas of the
brain<00:02:09.789> are<00:02:10.090> consuming<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.959> lot<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.110> oxygen<00:02:11.440> so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
brain are consuming a lot of oxygen so

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.030 
brain are consuming a lot of oxygen so
we<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:12.819> with<00:02:13.360> millimeter<00:02:13.930> precision<00:02:14.200> which

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
we know with millimeter precision which

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.589 
we know with millimeter precision which
areas<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> brain<00:02:15.610> are<00:02:15.910> active<00:02:16.300> at<00:02:16.480> any

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
areas of the brain are active at any

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.110 
areas of the brain are active at any
given<00:02:16.900> moment<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:17.410> fMRI<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.550> little<00:02:18.820> slow

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
given moment but fMRI is a little slow

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.810

especially<00:02:20.110> compared<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.500> eg<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.550> with<00:02:21.670> my

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
especially compared to eg but with my

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
especially compared to eg but with my
project<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.540> by

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
project we can by

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.630 
project we can by
these<00:02:22.959> techniques<00:02:23.379> together<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:24.250> EEG

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
these techniques together with EEG

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.449 
these techniques together with EEG
telling<00:02:25.239> us<00:02:25.360> when<00:02:26.050> these<00:02:26.590> epileptic<00:02:27.190> spikes

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
telling us when these epileptic spikes

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.820 
telling us when these epileptic spikes
are<00:02:27.640> occurring<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.239> then<00:02:28.720> fMRI<00:02:29.260> showing<00:02:29.709> us

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
are occurring and then fMRI showing us

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.770 
are occurring and then fMRI showing us
where<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> brain<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.150> active<00:02:31.510> at<00:02:31.599> any

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
where in the brain is active at any

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.479 
where in the brain is active at any
moment<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.709> get<00:02:32.830> images<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:33.250> look<00:02:33.370> like

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
moment so we get images that look like

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.330 
moment so we get images that look like
this<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.599> for<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:34.900> person<00:02:35.410> whenever<00:02:36.099> they're

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
this so for this person whenever they're

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.610 
this so for this person whenever they're
having<00:02:36.580> an<00:02:36.670> epileptic<00:02:37.000> spike<00:02:37.420> that's<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
having an epileptic spike that's the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.920 
having an epileptic spike that's the
area<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> brain<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:39.459> active<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.480> our

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
area of the brain that's active so our

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.930 
area of the brain that's active so our
hope<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.769> with<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:41.980> project<00:02:42.310> one<00:02:42.760> day

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
hope is that with this project one day

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.119 
hope is that with this project one day
we'll<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.150> able<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.420> draw<00:02:43.629> roadmaps<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.590> we

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
we'll be able to draw roadmaps that we

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.369 
we'll be able to draw roadmaps that we
can<00:02:45.280> give<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.459> surgeons<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.030> say<00:02:46.269> cut<00:02:46.930> here

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
can give to surgeons that say cut here

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.979 
can give to surgeons that say cut here
to<00:02:47.830> cure<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.190> person<00:02:48.549> of<00:02:48.640> epilepsy<00:02:49.000> thank

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
to cure this person of epilepsy thank

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.110 
to cure this person of epilepsy thank
