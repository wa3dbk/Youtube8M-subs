00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.780
 but I think I deserve to win today 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.020
 enough 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.200
 collected selflessly played were good 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.020
 under standard provisions this 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.340
 logical victory is better for us very 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.670
 this match was important especially as 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.390
 the opponent brought quite serious 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.000
 Composition those who did not have match practice 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.989
 many football players were given the opportunity 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.699
 play no here you must understand that 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.649
 the beam deserved to win not exactly 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:57.750
 I deliberately made a bet on this match 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.440
 knowing knowingly that she is our group 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.300
 There are players who already have 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.020
 a big load on myself I told them that 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.540
 that's the most important thing put it in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 this match and I'll give you a meal 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.860
 take a break 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.830
 what were the scoring chances used 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 the first half practically nothing anywhere 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.350
 either create rubies except 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 costly hunger no first goal 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 did not significantly affect the course at all 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.640
 events but another I did 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.149
 I repeat that 5 players played 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 so low below its level that 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.700
 generally incomprehensible to his own free throw 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.730
 went striker ran into the first goal 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.010
 is always 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.760
 especially in the first minutes the team 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.560
 somehow somehow knocks off the game 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.420
 Well, of course not immediately felt 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.410
 self-reliance immediately ie 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 very helpful 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.630
 and 2 and 3 when we missed a goal 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.049
 I literally do not remember about 10 minutes and we immediately 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.299
 2 3 yes take these goals were still 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.210
 more importantly the boys are working on 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.140
 maximum exhaust is the most important 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.560
 today's business card 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.590
 books would like to add more bolt 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.550
 skillful and diverse and creation 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.190
 as for destruction i think that in 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.489
 we have no equal in this component 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.209
 the fact is that the ruby ​​delivered us too 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.750
 a lot of trouble and anyway 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.569
 as for penetrators pass over 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.850
 back center back well 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.830
 Naturally, no team fnl us 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.930
 in my opinion for the entire tournament stack gear 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.720
 didn't do it therefore for us too 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.739
 very important point that we have to 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.030
 we will grind 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.910
 played from the result save the result 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.319
 embodied life and on video until the end of all 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.630
 force given 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.000
 Well, now we are preparing naufor 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.200
 such games are nice but forget them 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 go further know all training Kurban 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.670
 Bekievich is my countryman 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 also the rest of the coach so much of mine 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.200
 countrymen 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.080
 the team who are not pro is not obtained 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.909
 Well, I think their results are not all ahead 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.739
 the league will not give they perform very well in 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.780
 Europa League is a little bit and it affects 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.900
 in the championship but we don't win them yet 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.900
 in front
