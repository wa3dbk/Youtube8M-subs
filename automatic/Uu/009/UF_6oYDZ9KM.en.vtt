00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
bit snug to get it in takes a little bit

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.010 
bit snug to get it in takes a little bit
of<00:00:53.530> muscle<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.940> now<00:00:58.120> we've<00:00:58.300> got<00:00:58.510> all<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.809> our

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
of muscle so now we've got all of our

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.979 
of muscle so now we've got all of our
stakes<00:00:59.470> into<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.340> holder<00:01:00.730> very<00:01:01.390> convenient

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
stakes into the holder very convenient

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:18.050 
stakes into the holder very convenient
and<00:01:02.170> now<00:01:02.290> we're<00:01:02.440> going<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.680> set<00:01:02.860> up<00:01:02.980> our<00:01:03.160> TV

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420 

we've<00:01:19.060> constructed<00:01:19.630> our<00:01:19.990> poll<00:01:20.320> it<00:01:21.219> was<00:01:21.399> a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
we've constructed our poll it was a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.950 
we've constructed our poll it was a
little<00:01:21.670> bit<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.939> a<00:01:22.000> challenge<00:01:22.240> getting<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.840> to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
little bit of a challenge getting it to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.719 
little bit of a challenge getting it to
work<00:01:23.110> but<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.439> finally<00:01:23.680> figured<00:01:23.950> out<00:01:24.219> that<00:01:24.549> the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
work but we finally figured out that the

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.389 
work but we finally figured out that the
polls<00:01:25.000> need<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.509> be<00:01:25.659> not<00:01:26.500> sticking<00:01:27.009> out<00:01:27.130> so

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
polls need to be not sticking out so

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.160 
polls need to be not sticking out so
much<00:01:27.549> at<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.820> top<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.329> then<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.689> seemed<00:01:28.930> to

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
much at the top and then it seemed to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.679 
much at the top and then it seemed to
work<00:01:29.200> really<00:01:29.409> well<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.850> today<00:01:31.390> what<00:01:31.600> we're

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
work really well so today what we're

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.240 
work really well so today what we're
going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.929> do<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.679> we're<00:01:32.829> going<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:33.159> be

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
going to do is that we're going to be

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.520 
going to do is that we're going to be
planting<00:01:33.549> lamps<00:01:34.179> on<00:01:34.329> three<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.750> our<00:01:34.899> poles<00:01:35.200> and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
planting lamps on three of our poles and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.980 
planting lamps on three of our poles and
seeds<00:01:36.250> on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.759> other<00:01:36.939> stream<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.329> our<00:01:37.450> coal<00:01:37.659> to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
seeds on the other stream of our coal to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.919 
seeds on the other stream of our coal to
extend<00:01:38.500> our<00:01:38.619> harvest<00:01:39.039> so<00:01:39.909> we<00:01:40.270> broke<00:01:40.569> up<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
extend our harvest so we broke up the

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.899 
extend our harvest so we broke up the
ground<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.710> I've<00:01:42.069> got<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.369> nice<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.759> loose

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.450 
ground and I've got it nice and loose
here<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:44.350> what<00:01:44.530> we're<00:01:44.679> going<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.890> do<00:01:45.100> is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
we're going to take just a little bit of

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.320 
we're going to take just a little bit of
dr.<00:01:53.470> earth<00:01:53.590> fertilizer<00:01:56.849> and<00:01:57.849> say<00:01:58.060> about<00:01:58.270> a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330

good tablespoon or so and then I'm going
to<00:02:00.880> mix<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.240> up<00:02:01.270> generously<00:02:01.840> inside<00:02:02.319> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
to mix that up generously inside the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.559 
to mix that up generously inside the
hole<00:02:02.979> where<00:02:03.159> we're<00:02:03.280> planning<00:02:03.610> our<00:02:03.700> green<00:02:03.880> bean

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.020 

so<00:02:07.569> we'll<00:02:07.720> pop<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:07.959> out<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.380> our<00:02:08.470> pot<00:02:11.880> set<00:02:12.880> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
so we'll pop it out of our pot set it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.940 
so we'll pop it out of our pot set it
there<00:02:15.000> gently<00:02:16.000> fill<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.329> around<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.110> then

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
there gently fill in around it and then

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.610 
there gently fill in around it and then
we'll<00:02:18.099> watch<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.489> grow<00:02:18.670> up<00:02:18.730> our<00:02:18.880> pull<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:20.500> our

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
we'll watch it grow up our pull for our

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.980 
we'll watch it grow up our pull for our
seeds<00:02:21.299> we<00:02:22.299> broke<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.750> up

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
seeds we broke it up

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.320 
seeds we broke it up

three<00:02:39.910> three<00:02:40.910> beans<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.600> each<00:02:41.990> hole<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.400> what

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
three three beans in each hole so what

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.400 
three three beans in each hole so what
you<00:02:43.670> do<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.090> I'm<00:02:44.300> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.600> separate<00:02:45.080> them<00:02:45.260> by

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
you do is I'm going to separate them by

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.730 
you do is I'm going to separate them by
a<00:02:45.440> few<00:02:45.710> inches

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
a few inches

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.810 
a few inches
green<00:02:48.740> beans<00:02:48.980> go<00:02:49.190> one<00:02:49.580> inch<00:02:50.030> deep<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.860> then

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
green beans go one inch deep and then

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.490 
green beans go one inch deep and then
what<00:02:52.970> I'm<00:02:53.060> going<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.330> add<00:02:53.510> on<00:02:53.690> top<00:02:53.900> according

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
what I'm going to add on top according

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.040 
what I'm going to add on top according
to<00:02:54.590> directions<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.790> inoculant<00:02:56.480> that

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
to directions is the inoculant that

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.980 
to directions is the inoculant that
helps<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.740> beans<00:02:58.120> access<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.270> nitrogen<00:02:59.750> and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
helps the beans access the nitrogen and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.250 
helps the beans access the nitrogen and
nutrients<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.710> they<00:03:00.890> need<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.100> grow<00:03:02.260> so

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
nutrients that they need to grow so

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.320 
nutrients that they need to grow so
we're<00:03:03.440> going<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.800> sprinkle<00:03:04.160> some<00:03:04.880> right<00:03:05.180> on

we're going to sprinkle some right on
top<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> seed<00:03:10.480> looks<00:03:11.480> like<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.050> it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
top of the seed looks like this it's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.460 
top of the seed looks like this it's
kind<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.340> little<00:03:13.490> granule<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:17.350> then<00:03:18.350> we're

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
kind of a little granule and then we're

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.850 
kind of a little granule and then we're
going<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.710> gently<00:03:18.920> cover<00:03:19.340> them<00:03:19.520> over<00:03:20.860> patting

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
going to gently cover them over patting

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.970 
going to gently cover them over patting
it<00:03:21.950> down<00:03:21.980> one<00:03:22.490> inch<00:03:22.670> deep<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.740> then<00:03:24.740> we'll<00:03:24.890> be

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
it down one inch deep and then we'll be

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.370 
it down one inch deep and then we'll be
