00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.990
 It was that tob price of Maeba Kojima was ton 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.600
 Be trending has the feature of continuing 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.839
 I am 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.109
 Just by riding on that wave but big 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 You can inflate the image though 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.650
 Continuation of the tiger 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.909
 Two decades ago often 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.659
 If that is the direction for many investors from all over the world 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.539
 It is in the world which can lose 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.579
 There is a head group new 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 It is Mr. Muneo 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 According to Mr. Muneo, I think as time goes by 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.450
 The same situation is expected to continue in the trend 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 Is 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 Even if it breaks down, there is no rational reason 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 In addition, it is easy to be inclined to be brought up by being brought up in tour 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 There is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.280
 Also the site and implementation of that many media and big 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 There seems to be such a day 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.510
 Similarly, if it is one meal, it is easy to be inclined to corporate battle 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.020
 Is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.100
 Just like that, people like me 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.570
 Is 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 I will 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.620
 after 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.970
 Figure 1 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.960
 It will be hilarious that the subjective technology to build is utilized 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.730
 right 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.250
 There is no rational reason for that kind of thing 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.320
 Digging for the title that will be the heart of everyone around 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.049
 It is not good 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.849
 postpet peach group 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.699
 New 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.979
 Because 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.319
 There is a thing to catch with the human who took away 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.999
 Because 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.889
 If everyone has started to commute differently, they will be bearish 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.359
 It is that 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.839
 Beat such features 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.839
 I transferred 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.919
 Most of all 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.869
 It is a basic strategy as such
