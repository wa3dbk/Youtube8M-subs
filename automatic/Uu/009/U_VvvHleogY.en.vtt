00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.010
 I decided to make my battery 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:12.469
 control on the training cycle 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:19.010
 Here is a light bulb at 12 volts 35 you 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.010
 connected to the battery for discharge 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:27.590
 such a procedure is done for training 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.089
 battery 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:37.230
 since she was exposed 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:43.670
 deep discharge in the winter several times I 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.379
 I decided to hold well, such a discharge charge 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 may have several times 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:56.159
 discharge charge in order to recover 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:03.749
 at least the highest possible capacity 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:10.710
 battery discharges battery up to 10 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:14.060
 and 8 or 10 and 5 volts under load below 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.960
 below this voltage do not discharge 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.620
 such a device is recommended 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.640
 other 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.640
 I changed with a smooth current adjustment 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.860
 and with manual and automatic 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.979
 settings 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.130
 do it in Ukraine I really like 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:46.550
 his vintage design is like that 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:51.110
 from the old days when I will be next 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.740
 try and wait to control 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.340
 because the voltage does not fall to 10 and 8 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.340
 . 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.990
 something like this
