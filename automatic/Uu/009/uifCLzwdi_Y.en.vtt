00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.010
 obligation that is called reflection 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.270
 that is both for windows mac and we 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.370
 will serve to visualize our 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.270
 device through the computer 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.070
 We all remember on a pc 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.230
 does not require connecting carlos es 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.859
 simply a wifi network can 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.090
 to download 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.700
 or buy because cool 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.180
 I here I have it installed and 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.180
 Discharged 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.850
 that is the icon 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.120
 and it will be opened to them little dog hoping that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.510
 connect the device that can be a 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.440
 try with my iphone 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.719
 the are play 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.940
 they do not activate they are not adjusted nothing but 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.250
 that simply by having activated the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.950
 program plus a wifi connection where 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.660
 the device is inside it 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.570
 you talk the multitasking they go 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.760
 towards the more tense side next and they go to 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.000
 find that button 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.840
 do not tighten and you were to appear for example 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.820
 a computer 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.820
 and I'm going to put advertising 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.329
 and nothing appears on the screen 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.329
 very very good they do not have practically 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.810
 nothing of the can visualize all the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.810
 phone 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.830
 when they realize 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.460
 for example if they were things in the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.460
 baixada or landscape that are purchased 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.180
 and even garrisoned games 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.180
 war 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:56.110
 the games until the sound will be inside 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.110
 from the computer and not from the phone 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.929

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:16.400

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:19.390
