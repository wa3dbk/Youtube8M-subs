think<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.110> really<00:02:15.319> well<00:02:15.590> written<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.160> love

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
think it's really well written I love

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.460 
think it's really well written I love
the<00:02:16.790> scene<00:02:17.060> work<00:02:17.330> between<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.990> characters

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the scene work between the characters

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.260 
the scene work between the characters
and<00:02:18.650> their<00:02:18.770> interactions<00:02:19.520> there<00:02:20.090> were<00:02:20.209> a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and their interactions there were a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.480 
and their interactions there were a
couple<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.690> times<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.170> felt<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:21.739> it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
couple of times I felt like it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.120 
couple of times I felt like it
a<00:02:22.520> little<00:02:22.880> bit<00:02:23.230> expeditionary<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.560> little<00:02:25.010> bit

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
a little bit expeditionary a little bit

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950 
a little bit expeditionary a little bit
on<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> nose<00:02:25.610> there's<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.270> particular<00:02:26.750> scene

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
on the nose there's a particular scene

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.530 
on the nose there's a particular scene
I'm<00:02:27.110> thinking<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:28.370> April<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.090> her<00:02:29.270> coach

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
I'm thinking of with April and her coach

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
I'm thinking of with April and her coach
and<00:02:29.720> she's<00:02:29.930> doing<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.230> history<00:02:30.590> paper<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.250> she

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
and she's doing a history paper and she

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
and she's doing a history paper and she
doesn't<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.150> why<00:02:32.450> she<00:02:32.480> does<00:02:32.930> things<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
doesn't know why she does things and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.830 
doesn't know why she does things and
this<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.220> sums<00:02:34.490> up<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.940> entirety<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
this really sums up the entirety of the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.860 
this really sums up the entirety of the
entire<00:02:36.350> film<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:37.100> one<00:02:37.520> line<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.450> movie

be 100% natural in front of the cameras
lens<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.180> definitely<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> minimalistic

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
lens it is definitely a minimalistic

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.790 
lens it is definitely a minimalistic
style<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.490> acting<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.240> editing<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:21.050> slightly

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
style of acting the editing was slightly

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.210 
style of acting the editing was slightly
unusual<00:03:22.010> which<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.940> enjoyed<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.810> wasn't

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
unusual which I enjoyed it wasn't

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.560 
unusual which I enjoyed it wasn't
stagnant<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.370> know<00:03:25.550> there<00:03:25.940> were<00:03:26.120> overlapping

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
stagnant you know there were overlapping

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.680 
stagnant you know there were overlapping
scenes<00:03:27.290> where<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:28.250> scene<00:03:28.520> would<00:03:28.820> move<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.330> but

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
scenes where the scene would move on but

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.810 
scenes where the scene would move on but
the<00:03:29.840> voices<00:03:30.080> happening<00:03:30.860> from<00:03:31.010> before<00:03:31.430> still

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
the voices happening from before still

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.880 
the voices happening from before still
blended<00:03:32.360> in<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.990> I<00:03:33.020> like<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.380> sort<00:03:33.800> of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
blended in so I like that sort of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.030 
blended in so I like that sort of
crossover<00:03:34.460> bar<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.970> did<00:03:35.300> feel<00:03:35.780> influences<00:03:36.770> from

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
crossover bar I did feel influences from

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.000 
crossover bar I did feel influences from
Sophia<00:03:37.640> Coppola<00:03:37.970> work<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.500> felt<00:03:39.710> like

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
Sophia Coppola work in this I felt like

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.370 
Sophia Coppola work in this I felt like
there<00:03:40.190> were<00:03:40.280> some<00:03:40.460> similarities<00:03:40.700> there<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:42.290> I

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
there were some similarities there and I

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.980 
there were some similarities there and I
do<00:03:42.440> like<00:03:42.800> Sophia<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.220> couple<00:03:43.520> of<00:03:43.640> movies<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.540> I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
do like Sophia a couple of movies so I

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.130 
do like Sophia a couple of movies so I
feel<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.680> minimalistic<00:03:46.610> style<00:03:46.940> just<00:03:47.750> really

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
feel that minimalistic style just really

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.430 
feel that minimalistic style just really
works<00:03:48.860> for<00:03:49.280> these<00:03:49.480> types<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.690> stories<00:03:51.020> maybe

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
works for these types of stories maybe

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.140 
works for these types of stories maybe
this<00:03:51.710> film<00:03:51.950> doesn't<00:03:52.220> have<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.580> definitive
