 career let's hit hook flight game 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.949
 cool enough done here such 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.480
 we are cars will certainly not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.390
 unrealistically drawn but still 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.080
 cute very cute we can paint them 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.670
 we want to choose cars gradually they 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.470
 I will open this video here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.990
 closed let's pick some 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.990
 car let's say we make it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 blue color click stylist choose 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.460
 different tracks too they will 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.440
 gradually open 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.140
 push start 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.210
 now we start the race during the race 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 I chose not truly the plot 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.730
 pass them there up to 4 cars blue 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:37.010
 I am mistaken here is your control over 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.960
 I left the right is very simple. 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.900
 it is right and can also be used 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.810
 Accelerator over the track itself is shown 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.710
 how we ride here is time and everything else 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.880
 beauty beautifully made convenient control 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.300
 so very interesting 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 game similar to the game micro machines dan 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.900
 the game went on sega those who played this 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.020
 the game probably remembers toy 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.440
 cars were here as not toys but 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.399
 anyway very nicely done let me 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.420
 I will pass one track and also show you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.900
 career mode because small 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.540
 the other there in the cars will be different 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.780
 characteristics speed there all became 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.600
 After all, we can also recruit him 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.980
 the track can additionally accelerator 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.350
 make it easier for us to pass 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.910
 so it remains rather big remained to me 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.840
 drive one lap like this 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.930
 let's go 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.930
 and 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:52.260
 so here is the last lap lighting here 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.980
 I occupy the second place now 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 statistics 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.210
 as we drove everything else so 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.390
 let me show you a quick mode 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.820

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.450
 showed while loading 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.420
 so I want to say that in this game 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.330
 available about 20 different trails very 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.880
 many cars push career again also 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.190
 choose a car you see 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.800
 acceleration control characteristics it 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.120
 not only then we push acceleration 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.700
 car is the speed at all 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.230
 most of which we have so here 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.130
