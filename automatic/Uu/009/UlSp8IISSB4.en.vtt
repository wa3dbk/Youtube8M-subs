can and we've been very impressed with
it<00:03:01.349> now<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.190> give<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.489> an<00:03:02.579> idea<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
it now to give you an idea this is a

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.080 
it now to give you an idea this is a
native<00:03:03.900> high-res<00:03:04.440> format<00:03:05.010> player<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.970> it's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
native high-res format player so it's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.110 
native high-res format player so it's
gonna<00:03:06.200> Pro<00:03:07.200> that's<00:03:07.530> gonna<00:03:07.680> play<00:03:08.129> in<00:03:08.519> 24-bit

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
gonna Pro that's gonna play in 24-bit

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.650 
gonna Pro that's gonna play in 24-bit
and<00:03:09.329> 192<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.290> makes<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.799> better<00:03:11.040> than<00:03:11.910> Sonos

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
and 192 it makes it better than Sonos

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.089 
and 192 it makes it better than Sonos
because<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.290> knows<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.620> only<00:03:13.739> go<00:03:13.950> up<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
because so knows can only go up to

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.080 
because so knows can only go up to
16-bit<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.410> forty<00:03:16.410> four<00:03:16.920> point<00:03:17.280> eight<00:03:17.519> K<00:03:17.880> or

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
16-bit and forty four point eight K or

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.410 
16-bit and forty four point eight K or
48<00:03:18.510> K<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.720> believe<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.670> makes<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.180> huge

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
48 K I believe so it makes a huge

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.400 
48 K I believe so it makes a huge
difference<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.930> quality<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.260> sound

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
difference in the quality of sound

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.690 
difference in the quality of sound
you're<00:03:22.530> gonna<00:03:22.620> get<00:03:22.799> out<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.579> have

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
you're gonna get out of this if you have

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.000 
you're gonna get out of this if you have
flat<00:03:23.850> files<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.780> course<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.620> future<00:03:25.769> is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
flat files and of course the future is

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.440 
flat files and of course the future is
moving<00:03:26.370> towards<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.090> looking<00:03:27.359> at

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
moving towards that if you're looking at

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.629 
moving towards that if you're looking at
