00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 Stitch I have at the start 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.779
 you see the big house 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 an incredible discovery 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.599
 the beginning of a new adventure 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.599
 it comes to a big story 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 a story time 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 I do not think about it 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.820
 and that is so the world giving CYBEX Rebensburg states its first 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.600
 Victory since the 14th 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 high Bundesliga are to be seen now also around this trend 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.530

 to welcome the new spectators there will be some coming up to me 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.750
 A lot of consequences to become partners on such a show 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.460
 Messi will give many emotions many adventures West will happen a lot 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980
 140 responsible 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.770
