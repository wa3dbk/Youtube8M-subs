00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi to all patient wagons on 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome and finally to a new one 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.210
 doctor game episode after being there 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.559
 concentrate last time so much 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 varied hardware 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.990
 but this time we will speak yet 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.150
 abundantly of many useless details 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.660
 plumbing techniques of the minimums 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 details 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 another museum piece of which there is no 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 give a damn 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.279
 completely ignoring everyone fantastic 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 of races that could be done on 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 games so let's start with the console 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.280
 today's courage is enough for another 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.429
 given all time 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.190
 okay okay ok i admit it you have it 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:43.370
 asked many, perhaps even too many e 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.719
 nice to talk about console controllers like 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.309
 also of the events behind it 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.500
 all these things but there is always 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.210
 actually an aspect of the speech 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 that I never wanted to learn more about 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.409
 you will always know my focus 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.229
 the hardware when there was to be dealt with 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.390
 speech software that is the games I have 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.339
 always avoided there is a lot 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.530
 people who talk about it even better than me 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.740
 what a contribution I could make in mine 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.899
 small now of network what has changed 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 a dried fig in fact points black to not 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.460
 talk about games or rather not in the sense 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.789
 classic of the term how to do then a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 treat the subject avoiding the usual ones 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.280
 reviews and top ten 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.830
 well i honestly don't know but we could 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.920
 but start digging in the past 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.319
 looking for games joined by one 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.970
 same logical thread then maybe illogical 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.130
 a more streamlined heading comes out and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.080
 fast of the usual historical pappardelle 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.429
 that I like a lot or maybe it will be one 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.259
 total boiata goes well 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.250
 you will tell me then we inaugurate the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.990
 first episode of games with the first 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 absurd topic that came to me 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 mind the dinosaur games but first 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 theme song 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.690
 the games a doctor game 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.750
 what about a classic two brothers 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.459
 cave dwellers going to save women 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.920
 of his own village kidnapped by one 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.379
 opposing tribe for the most foul purposes 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.090
 in short, a whole game in which it pulls more 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.430
 a hair of t rex that goes well here the meat 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.859
 dinosaur is the main dish of all 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.599
 romantic dinners as the well knows also 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.280
 maniac caveman anxious of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.280
 mate with you at the end of the game 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 before turning into the umpteenth 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.569
 cod clone for bimbiminkia to rock is 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.519
 was an amazing action comic 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.079
 one of the most extraordinary games that 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.079
 accompanied the launch inside the 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.720
 64 the title that laughs ends with the chapter 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.810
 royal wars canons fps death match 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.180
 on consoles and above all the thing that most 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.280
 approached that strafiga ta 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.500
 cosmic 90s known by the name 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:21.060
 fallow deer riders what the hell of success 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.310
 tour then you thought that being 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.500
 happened in full 30's on one 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.840
 ramshackle biplane on a mission 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 suicide in the Bermuda triangle 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.829
 meant to be losers 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.750
 so what about the discovery of 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.819
 terrible makes a prehistoric with which 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.769
 we should have a shooter to do 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.019
 historical arcade with some of the most 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.209
 beautiful boss battles of all time 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.810
 and it is useless to stand still if they see you 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.810
 the same 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.660
 booming jurassic park could never 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.630
 missing a populated park simulator 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.730
 right from so many beautiful bad lizards 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.220
 take theme park in a bit, take it 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.500
 easier in stuffing with sauropods e 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.360
 give him a thematic educational plot 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.340
 environmental and here is the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.230
 perfect management in which to look for 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.560
 make the most extinct beasts of flourish 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.560
 all 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.280
 what could be nicer than to see a 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.990
 black pissed dinosaur see 5 is 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.940
 also a couple of truzzi simi monkeys 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.500
 so as not to miss anything 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.630
 if you thought plasticine didn't 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.360
 could take on such bastard features 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.400
 i bought man ray dvd creme rete no 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.080
 they are banned and wins whoever succeeds 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:46.120
 overwhelm the other with blows 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:47.889
 I had said roars as he could 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.470
 never miss an entire game trend 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.870
 of time based on the famous trilogy 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.090
 cinematographic jurassic park was 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.040
 accounts made a gigantic prehistoric 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.110
 prostitute have opposable thumbs 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.700
 was the only requirement to take the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.770
 license and develop a game 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.080
 certainly there were exceptions like the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.169
 fantastic versions for mega drives and 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.270
 nes to the styles adventure but then 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.690
 things like jurassic park iii 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.690
 pasteur and forget it 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:28.559
 I went forward on the hands of those who remembered 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:30.959
 that is, nobody was looking at anyone 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:32.339
 only I hope you at least have played ad 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.559
 one of the most beautiful fighting games a 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.849
 scroll never appeared in the room 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:39.989
 who would have thought that from a 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:42.240
 cartoon a bit they could 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:51.870
 to make a crazy joke 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:53.789
 the one-time capcom and let's go back to the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.849
 cavemen with the famous mascot of 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.400
 pc engine in bonn kobe site games 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.650
 where yes and kidd what you say not 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.660
 there is certainly no lack of prehistoric fauna e 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.940
 absurd, sure enough is difficult 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.069
 focus on anything other than the 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.509
 deformed head of the protagonist but 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.000
 just try these games for 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.340
 notice that it is a platform 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.580
 superfine really like a few try 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.580
 to believe 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.960
 ok it's a game for the under book 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:43.070
 I always smile hello I know I know it 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.530
 expect the king of games co 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.050
 dinosaurs what could ever come out 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.150
 from the mixture between jurassic park and the 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.030
 great nice braid of the pope of 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.260
 residents but an obvious experience 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.600
 unforgettable 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.700
 at least as much as the trauma caused by 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.070
 that mammoth crap of the third 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:05.060
 chapter da everything is fine but i 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:07.900
 mutant dinosaurs in space 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:14.170
 ok ok let's repeat it together dinosaurs 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.170
 mutants in the goddamn space 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.009
 other games with the dinosaurs I do 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.199
 but they obviously come to mind 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.000
 come to you write apple trees in the comments 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.250

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:40.069
 cookware set with shimano e 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:42.409
