00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
 after we put the video movie 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.970
 maker cut off superfluous arranged 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.830
 in the right order we see this 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.879
 picture and here we have three fragments 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.250
 time line and now we want like all this 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.309
 it's more convenient to decorate with effects 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.580
 do schematically in desktop mode 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.900
 we see all the same but now the form 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.800
 schemes here they are these three fragments and here are the places 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.030
 third stage of transition 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.560
 notice these places between 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.999
 video clips 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.119
 transition effect 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.249
 one video to go smoothly 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.339
 other 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.050
 and here are these rectangles for 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.780
 effects of another type these effects acts 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.089
 on fat video clips 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:36.900
 for example once 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.780
 ask them notice how 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.820
 these rectangles are activated not 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.450
 miss rectangles 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.640
 badge 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.610
 and here is the transition effect with the icon 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 triangle look carefully 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 exactly which icon is active is important 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500
 remind 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.540
 from work in collection mode now 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.670
 we put effect itself an asterisk an asterisk 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.390
 triangle triangle 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.940
 here we are just a triangle 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.110
 received a list of all transition effects 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.090
 all very clearly put 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.199
 see the corresponding place effect 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.960
 we can't prefect one type put 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.110
 in place is intended to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 be careful of another 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.820
 Now let's see what we see in the mode 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 time line 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.240
 here are the transition effects which 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.750
 put they are located on 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 individual tracks 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 here they work one video transition another 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.570
 You may notice that here our video has become 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.850
 slightly less so for transition effects 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.620
 necessary 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.100
 so how are they two pieces of cloth 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.000
 need one fragment a little 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.660
 went to another it is very important remember 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.000
 about 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.110
 move on to another type of edema we live 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 asterisk and get the list 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
 and there are quite a few 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.329
 see the place of transition effects 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.329
 they can not be put 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.239
 let's see the time line here they are asterisks 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.209
 the effect is right on the video clip 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.999
 no overwhelm for 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.999
 No effects of this type are required. 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.909
 here is another way for the sake of seeing effects 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.819
 hover over the video and click 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.779
 right-click opens this 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:40.759
 menu 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.369
 this is the same list of effects 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.129
 who have already seen 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.209
 but here you can see that the inspector 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.949
 you can impose a few 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.479
 on the left is a list of all available and to the right of 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.399
 those who courageously 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.399
 here's how to add or remove 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.199
 need to look now tormented here 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.799
 such 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.589
 I remind you that this is a way of bringing them 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.499
 Transition Effect Texts 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.469
 there is no such menu 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.139
 in the year replaced there are still farid and in the project 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.599
 and here is this black care is considered to be 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.079
 very common 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.059
 effects 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.229
 they will be given this 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.629
 useful menu items 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.389
 let's delete the sector 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.859
 You can delete them via the right key. 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.969
 click on the effect icon then right 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.329
 mouse buttons and then housing 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.989
 watch where are you katy mouse 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.799
 in the same way you can delete the view it 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.499
 transition 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.579
 and this way of working is two fights 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 modes 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.930
 attention when we hit and tekke 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.430
 transition the entire movie was longer due to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.409
 overwhelm schematically in mode 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.699
 it is not visible but in the time line mode 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.479
 well noticeable
