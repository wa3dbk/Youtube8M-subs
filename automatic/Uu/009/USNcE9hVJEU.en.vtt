00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
myself just to give me an idea of what

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.270 
myself just to give me an idea of what
it<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.760> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> look<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.950> once<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.100> was

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it was going to look like once I was

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.170 
it was going to look like once I was
satisfied<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.410> layout<00:01:49.410> I<00:01:49.970> turned<00:01:50.970> my

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
satisfied with the layout I turned my

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.410 
satisfied with the layout I turned my
attention<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.770> other<00:01:52.920> parts<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.270> these

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
attention to the other parts so these

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.210 
attention to the other parts so these
are<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:58.640> sports<00:01:59.640> rack<00:02:00.030> crossbars<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.560> towers

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
are the sports rack crossbars and towers

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.310 
are the sports rack crossbars and towers
that<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:02.610> picked<00:02:02.940> up<00:02:05.930> wanted<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.229> idea

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that I picked up wanted to get an idea

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.810 
that I picked up wanted to get an idea
of<00:02:07.770> how<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.100> fit<00:02:08.340> together

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
of how they fit together

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.710 
of how they fit together
on<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.209> rack<00:02:12.440> found<00:02:13.440> out<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.300> pretty<00:02:15.300> simple

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
on the rack found out that pretty simple

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
on the rack found out that pretty simple
actually<00:02:15.900> they're<00:02:16.350> held<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.770> by<00:02:16.950> these<00:02:17.010> little

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
actually they're held on by these little

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
actually they're held on by these little
clips<00:02:17.880> where<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.620> clip<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.520> rotated<00:02:21.150> in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
clips where the clip if it's rotated in

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.410 
clips where the clip if it's rotated in
one<00:02:21.630> direction<00:02:22.100> fits<00:02:23.100> into<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> slot<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
one direction fits into the slot of the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.860 
one direction fits into the slot of the
track<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:26.130> once<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.570> start

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
track and then once it's you start

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.470 
track and then once it's you start
tightening<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.590> down<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.790> shifts<00:02:30.330> its

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
tightening it down it shifts its

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.060 
tightening it down it shifts its
position<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.660> that's<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:34.080> holds

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
position and that's what actually holds

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.670 
position and that's what actually holds
the<00:02:35.250> rack<00:02:35.790> onto<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:38.130> track<00:02:38.519> itself<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the rack onto the track itself so if you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.100 
the rack onto the track itself so if you
watch<00:02:40.890> further<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> video<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:43.350> shows<00:02:45.110> what

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
watch further in the video it shows what

00:02:46.110 --> 00:03:25.510 
watch further in the video it shows what
that<00:02:46.290> looks<00:02:46.560> like

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.310 

you<00:03:26.210> can<00:03:26.390> see<00:03:26.630> there's<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:28.240> slit<00:03:29.240> inside<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
you can see there's a slit inside of the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.820 
you can see there's a slit inside of the
track<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:32.270> these<00:03:32.480> little<00:03:32.690> clips<00:03:33.230> will<00:03:33.530> fit

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
track that these little clips will fit

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.770 
track that these little clips will fit
right<00:03:33.860> inside<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.880> when<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.210> rotate<00:03:35.420> them<00:03:37.780> it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
right inside and when you rotate them it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.920 
right inside and when you rotate them it
won't<00:03:38.990> come<00:03:39.170> out<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:44.180> what<00:03:44.390> holds<00:03:44.570> the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
won't come out that's what holds the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.600 
won't come out that's what holds the
towers<00:03:45.440> on<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.770> also<00:03:48.920> see<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.430> they're

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
towers on you can also see that they're

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.390 
towers on you can also see that they're
adjustable<00:03:50.270> if<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.110> loosen<00:03:51.530> them<00:03:51.620> up<00:03:51.740> you<00:03:52.220> can

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
adjustable if you loosen them up you can

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.150 
adjustable if you loosen them up you can
slide<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.850> towers<00:03:53.210> up<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.690> down<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
slide the towers up and down in the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.660 
slide the towers up and down in the
tracks<00:03:55.460> themselves<00:03:57.220> next<00:03:58.220> was<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.520> get

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
tracks themselves next was to get

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.810 
tracks themselves next was to get
everything<00:03:58.940> cleaned<00:03:59.180> up<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:01.070> tracks<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.640> use

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
everything cleaned up the tracks I use

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.420 
everything cleaned up the tracks I use
soap<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.300> water<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.680> tried<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:04.100> new

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
soap and water and I tried this new

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.350 
soap and water and I tried this new
stuff<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.510> called<00:04:05.780> wipe<00:04:06.620> new<00:04:07.120> get<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.270> on

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
stuff it's called wipe new get it on

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.350 
stuff it's called wipe new get it on
late-night<00:04:09.400> infomercials<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:10.520> work<00:04:11.120> pretty

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
late-night infomercials but work pretty

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.570 
late-night infomercials but work pretty
well<00:04:11.770> for<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.950> towers<00:04:13.520> I<00:04:15.070> needed<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.280> little

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
well for the towers I needed a little

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.330 
well for the towers I needed a little
bit<00:04:16.640> more<00:04:16.700> so<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.690> ended<00:04:18.170> up<00:04:18.260> sandblasting<00:04:19.130> them

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
bit more so I ended up sandblasting them

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.310 
bit more so I ended up sandblasting them
as<00:04:19.610> you<00:04:20.270> can<00:04:20.420> see<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.600> didn't<00:04:20.870> get<00:04:20.959> all<00:04:21.200> the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
as you can see I didn't get all the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.000 
as you can see I didn't get all the
material<00:04:21.830> off<00:04:22.120> but<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.780> majority<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.560> came

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
material off but the majority of it came

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.640 
material off but the majority of it came
off<00:04:26.050> enough<00:04:27.050> for<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.620> good<00:04:27.980> base<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.930> use<00:04:29.930> Plasti

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
off enough for a good base I use Plasti

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.460 
off enough for a good base I use Plasti
Dip<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:31.430> success<00:04:31.880> with<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.420> past<00:04:32.690> it's

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
Dip that success with that the past it's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.210 
Dip that success with that the past it's
very<00:04:33.560> forgiving<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.530> it's<00:04:36.530> pretty<00:04:36.800> it's

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
very forgiving and it's pretty it's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.970 
very forgiving and it's pretty it's
pretty<00:04:37.340> sturdy<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:39.080> as<00:04:39.170> you<00:04:39.290> can<00:04:39.440> see<00:04:39.710> these

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
pretty sturdy so as you can see these

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.629 
pretty sturdy so as you can see these
towers<00:04:40.460> ended<00:04:40.760> up<00:04:40.850> looking<00:04:41.540> pretty<00:04:42.040> new

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.059 

this<00:04:46.939> point<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.419> was<00:04:47.569> time<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.259> install<00:04:48.889> the

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
this point it was time to install the

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.929 
this point it was time to install the
part<00:04:51.009> so<00:04:52.009> again<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.639> laid<00:04:52.970> out<00:04:53.180> everything

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
part so again I laid out everything

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.399 
part so again I laid out everything
marked<00:04:55.939> the<00:04:56.120> holes<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:56.960> was<00:04:57.110> going<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.289> be

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
marked the holes that I was going to be

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.899 
marked the holes that I was going to be
drilling<00:04:57.740> into<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.699> shell<00:05:00.069> once<00:05:01.069> the<00:05:01.370> holes

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
drilling into the shell once the holes

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.219 
drilling into the shell once the holes
were<00:05:02.150> drilled<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:03.939> turned<00:05:04.939> around<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.509> filled

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
were drilled I turned around and filled

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.600 
were drilled I turned around and filled
the<00:05:06.680> holes<00:05:07.449> with<00:05:08.449> silicone<00:05:09.439> sealant<00:05:10.189> didn't

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the holes with silicone sealant didn't

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.779 
the holes with silicone sealant didn't
want<00:05:10.759> any<00:05:10.969> leaks<00:05:12.009> so<00:05:13.009> you<00:05:13.099> see<00:05:13.370> here<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
want any leaks so you see here the

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.080 
want any leaks so you see here the
silicone<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.449> just<00:05:14.659> put<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.650> gob<00:05:15.949> of<00:05:16.129> it<00:05:16.280> inside

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
silicone I just put a gob of it inside

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.469 
silicone I just put a gob of it inside
each<00:05:17.300> one<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.719> holes<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:19.400> did<00:05:19.940> go<00:05:20.090> out<00:05:20.120> and

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
each one of the holes I did go out and

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.680 
each one of the holes I did go out and
spend<00:05:21.050> some<00:05:21.259> money<00:05:21.440> on<00:05:21.770> some<00:05:22.190> hardware<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:22.969> used

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
spend some money on some hardware I used

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.010 
spend some money on some hardware I used
some<00:05:23.870> stainless<00:05:24.440> steel<00:05:24.710> quarter<00:05:25.219> inch<00:05:25.400> bolts

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
some stainless steel quarter inch bolts

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.619 
some stainless steel quarter inch bolts
washers<00:05:27.020> or<00:05:27.680> lock<00:05:27.889> washer<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.699> then<00:05:28.789> a<00:05:29.330> lock

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
washers or lock washer and then a lock

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.159 
washers or lock washer and then a lock
nut<00:05:29.659> I<00:05:30.229> had<00:05:31.099> some<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.879> think<00:05:32.479> it's<00:05:32.690> one<00:05:32.990> and<00:05:33.110> a

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
nut I had some I think it's one and a

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.629 
nut I had some I think it's one and a
half<00:05:33.469> inch<00:05:33.860> aluminum<00:05:34.610> bar<00:05:36.069> flat<00:05:37.069> bar<00:05:37.280> laying

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
half inch aluminum bar flat bar laying

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.379 
half inch aluminum bar flat bar laying
around<00:05:37.849> so<00:05:38.449> I<00:05:38.779> drilled<00:05:39.169> some<00:05:39.319> holes<00:05:39.349> in<00:05:39.800> that

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
around so I drilled some holes in that

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.219 
around so I drilled some holes in that
my<00:05:41.389> plan<00:05:41.659> is<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:42.139> use<00:05:42.169> that<00:05:42.650> for<00:05:43.009> underneath

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
my plan is to use that for underneath

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.510 
my plan is to use that for underneath
probably<00:05:45.229> didn't<00:05:45.650> need<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:45.979> I<00:05:46.069> think<00:05:46.310> it<00:05:46.430> was

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
probably didn't need it I think it was

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.939 
probably didn't need it I think it was
overkill<00:05:47.110> but<00:05:48.110> I<00:05:48.469> had<00:05:49.069> it<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:50.319> why<00:05:51.319> not<00:05:51.500> use<00:05:51.740> it

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
overkill but I had it so why not use it

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.760 
overkill but I had it so why not use it
this<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.250> what<00:05:52.520> it<00:05:52.550> looks<00:05:52.789> like<00:05:52.969> underneath

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
this is what it looks like underneath

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:00.159 
this is what it looks like underneath
once<00:05:54.770> everything<00:05:55.279> is<00:05:55.310> installed<00:05:58.930> did<00:05:59.930> take<00:06:00.139> a

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
once everything is installed did take a
