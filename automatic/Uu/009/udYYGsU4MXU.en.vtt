after this does not really take that
long<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.310> probably<00:01:44.579> said<00:01:44.820> before<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
long as I probably said before it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
long as I probably said before it
actually<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.530> quick<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:47.009> takes

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
actually really quick actually takes

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.690 
actually really quick actually takes
very<00:01:47.880> quick<00:01:48.479> amount<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> time<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.290> oh<00:01:49.700> it's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
very quick amount of time so oh it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069
