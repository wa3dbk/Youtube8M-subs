00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
idea across for you guys so let's start

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
idea across for you guys so let's start
off<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> Excalibur<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
off as you can see this Excalibur is

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.830 
off as you can see this Excalibur is
loaded<00:01:58.229> currently<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.850> odd<00:02:00.119> manner

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
loaded currently in a very odd manner

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
loaded currently in a very odd manner
and<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.890> mainly<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and that's mainly because this is the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.200 
and that's mainly because this is the
mod<00:02:03.719> configuration<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.530> chose<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:05.969> see

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
mod configuration I chose as you can see

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.960 
mod configuration I chose as you can see
the<00:02:06.630> top<00:02:06.840> left<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.469> bottom<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the top left to bottom right is the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.150 
the top left to bottom right is the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
whole entire configuration system 1

whole entire configuration system 1
through<00:02:11.400> 10<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.900> set<00:02:12.930> up

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
through 10 so I have it set up

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930 
through 10 so I have it set up
like<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.530> next<00:02:14.980> card<00:02:15.280> over<00:02:15.730> which

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
like this so the next card over which

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.480 
like this so the next card over which
should<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.420> third<00:02:16.630> one<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.020> blank<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.130> jump

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
should be the third one is blank so jump

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.790 
should be the third one is blank so jump
down<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.910> next<00:02:19.090> line<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.540> lock<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
quickest possible mean because the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.720 
quickest possible mean because the
polarities<00:02:23.470> match<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> lets<00:02:24.160> me<00:02:24.310> actually

polarities match and it lets me actually

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.360

as you can see here in the back they

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.890 
as you can see here in the back they
hear<00:03:03.910> some<00:03:04.090> gameplay<00:03:04.420> footage<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.780> me

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
attacking a rail and you can see as I

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.970 
attacking a rail and you can see as I
start<00:03:06.940> killing<00:03:07.330> basically<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.410> Spektor's

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
start killing basically I and Spektor's

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.250 
start killing basically I and Spektor's
I<00:03:09.160> get<00:03:09.430> experience<00:03:10.180> which<00:03:10.900> slowly

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
I get experience which slowly

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.340 
I get experience which slowly
progressively<00:03:11.920> unlocks<00:03:12.580> all<00:03:13.060> my<00:03:13.390> gear<00:03:13.690> as<00:03:13.900> you

progressively unlocks all my gear as you
can<00:03:14.470> see<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:15.100> looks<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.670> picked<00:03:15.850> up<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> mod

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
can see it looks like I picked up a mod

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.930

thing can go for the defending team but

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.880 
thing can go for the defending team but
the<00:03:46.390> defending<00:03:46.720> team<00:03:46.870> doesn't<00:03:47.019> have<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.470> ticket
