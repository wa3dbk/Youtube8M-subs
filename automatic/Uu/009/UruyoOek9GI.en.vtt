I've<00:00:54.000> seen<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.809> pylons<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> forge

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I've seen a lot of pylons with a forge

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
I've seen a lot of pylons with a forge
and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.610> photon<00:00:57.059> cannon<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> then

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and then one photon cannon here and then

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229

one photon cannon here which does a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.770 
one photon cannon here which does a
great<00:01:00.690> job<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:01.350> protecting<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:03.059> natural

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

expansion as well as your main base as
well<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.600> zerglings<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.890> a

here you can get your gateway forward
cybernetics<00:01:23.820> core<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.689> build<00:01:24.960> units

roaches so you want to make sure that

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
roaches so you want to make sure that
your<00:01:34.530> opponent<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.250> opponent<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.880> zerg

tries to do a fast expansion if he does
fast<00:01:38.970> expand<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.470> expand<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.159> well

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
fast expand you can then expand as well

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
fast expand you can then expand as well

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
fast expansion if your opponent does go

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
fast expansion if your opponent does go
early<00:01:47.820> roaches<00:01:48.240> though<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:49.020> end<00:01:49.290> up

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
early roaches though and you do end up

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.580 
early roaches though and you do end up
going<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> much<00:01:50.880> earlier<00:01:51.090> an<00:01:51.659> expansion

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
to hold out use those cannons use some
zealots<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> use<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.380> ability<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.460> deal<00:01:59.640> a

they don't get to your probes then you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.580 
then you just flood out with a large
number<00:03:26.460> of<00:03:26.490> work<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.120> warp<00:03:27.390> gate<00:03:27.540> units<00:03:27.840> off<00:03:28.260> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
number of work of warp gate units off of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.860 
number of work of warp gate units off of
four<00:03:28.890> gateways<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.970> reason<00:03:30.270> why<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.720> hit

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
four gateways the reason why for hit

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.660 
four gateways the reason why for hit
works<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.320> well<00:03:31.350> especially<00:03:31.740> on<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.250> map<00:03:32.490> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
works so well especially on this map is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.420 
works so well especially on this map is
the<00:03:33.120> wider<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.870> choke<00:03:34.110> points<00:03:34.500> normally<00:03:35.400> a

a<00:03:39.900> ramp<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.180> wider<00:03:42.480> ramp

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
a ramp but because of the wider ramp

here<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.410> scrap<00:03:43.830> station<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.910> actually

here on scrap station and it actually

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.540 
here on scrap station and it actually
takes<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.780> force<00:03:46.080> fields<00:03:46.440> meaning<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.280> you

takes to force fields meaning that you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.190 
takes to force fields meaning that you
need<00:03:47.760> double<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.180> amount<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.600> centuries<00:03:49.050> in

need double the amount of centuries in

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.950 
need double the amount of centuries in
order<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.650> able<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.980> hold<00:03:50.250> off<00:03:50.610> an<00:03:50.940> army<00:03:51.570> for

the same amount of time what you may

the same amount of time what you may

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
want to try to do is if your are doing a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590 
want to try to do is if your are doing a
forged<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.800> place<00:03:56.010> up<00:03:56.250> high<00:03:56.460> line<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:57.000> little

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
forged is place up high line a little

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.260 
forged is place up high line a little
bit<00:03:57.750> out<00:03:58.050> of<00:03:58.080> range<00:03:58.530> perhaps<00:03:59.460> here<00:03:59.880> or<00:04:00.060> even

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
bit out of range perhaps here or even

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.990 
bit out of range perhaps here or even
here<00:04:00.710> here<00:04:01.710> is<00:04:01.800> probably<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.250> best<00:04:02.460> so<00:04:02.970> that

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
here here is probably the best so that

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120 
here here is probably the best so that
as<00:04:03.330> if<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.810> do<00:04:04.020> end<00:04:04.230> up<00:04:04.320> getting<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.620> zealot

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
as if you do end up getting the zealot

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.830 
as if you do end up getting the zealot
up<00:04:05.280> on<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.790> high<00:04:06.030> ground<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.420> still<00:04:06.690> have

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
up on that high ground you still have

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.720 
up on that high ground you still have
the<00:04:06.930> ability<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.320> work<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.800> units<00:04:08.190> here<00:04:08.520> and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
the ability to work in units here and

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.820 
the ability to work in units here and
then<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.390> make<00:04:09.630> your<00:04:09.810> opponent<00:04:10.110> have<00:04:10.650> to

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
then you make your opponent have to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.310 
then you make your opponent have to
fight<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> war<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.490> two<00:04:11.850> fronts<00:04:12.000> by<00:04:12.810> making<00:04:13.050> them

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
fight a war on two fronts by making them

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.440 
fight a war on two fronts by making them
have<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.710> cover<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.190> ramp<00:04:14.460> here<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:14.940> then

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
have to cover this ramp here and then

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.789 
have to cover this ramp here and then
warping<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.900> zealots<00:04:16.290> here<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.560> having

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
warping and zealots here and having

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.400 
warping and zealots here and having
stalkers<00:04:17.190> on<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.549> low<00:04:17.820> ground<00:04:18.080> look<00:04:19.080> what

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
stalkers on the low ground look what

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.900 
stalkers on the low ground look what
that<00:04:19.710> will<00:04:19.830> force<00:04:20.100> your<00:04:20.160> opponent<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.549> do<00:04:20.700> is

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
that will force your opponent to do is

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.400 
that will force your opponent to do is
try<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.450> figure<00:04:21.690> out<00:04:21.810> if<00:04:21.930> they<00:04:22.020> want<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.260> keep

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
try to figure out if they want to keep

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.680 
try to figure out if they want to keep
the<00:04:22.560> centuries<00:04:22.919> here<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.220> continue<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:24.120> guard
