00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.580
 this town that has had so much abandonment 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.000
 I do not think it's fair present for what 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.070
 so much 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 h 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.629
 percent 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.019
 clear they cover or even that a judge did not go to the constitutional court 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.919
 President 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.719
 they stopped before a judge who asked me for money and for not giving money 

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.599
 to do what he wants 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.380
 We dictate protecting us, in one part, an appeal to the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.649
 provincial 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.920
 of mere those that we know that also by the fact of asking for a popular consultation 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.460
 he will not deny and we are there waiting for him to go to the constitutional court 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.990
 so you see 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.180
 the whole process that was applied 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.240
 on one side removal that was done to them legally 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.249
 they do not want it to go to the minutes 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:49.530
 seven councilors the president 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280
 president we will not have declared in absentia sitting with the eyes with the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.490
 arms to the radio 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
 5 violence some little ball out of 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.710
 of the police silala that the purple gall but the council session 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.239
 we're going to do to make these gentlemen understand what 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.290
 It is not 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 per cent the way they have always threatened to send me publicly 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 in the sessions where I had to do the second deco sessions in the streets 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.400
 the markets in the parks in the precincts to be able 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.190
 apply the law and make ordinance because they have never presented a report 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.120
 of labors they raised the salary twice never present a bill 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.350
 of ordination has touched everything and never received even support 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.680
 provincial to be able to defend me from the attack of the mpd that is infiltrated three 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.710
 of movement country they left for the time already then we're already seven against 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.800
 one present 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.710
 r covers 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.710
 you want to take municipality not in the council session where the population 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.870
 the only thing I've asked is that it's to stay calm 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.530
 and that will not fall in the provocation is that the police will not protect and they 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.370
 what they do not want sessions to be done as they send because 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.130
 they do not have people president we are with the town the only thing that yes I say 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.630

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.310
 percent give the ministries al mpn alicia democratic allusion to the appointment 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.310

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.240

 having this opportunity to be not only the first mayor but also to see 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.420
