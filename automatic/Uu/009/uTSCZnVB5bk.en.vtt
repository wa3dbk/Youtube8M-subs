hi welcome back so I want to make a
quick<00:00:08.620> video<00:00:08.830> about<00:00:09.130> this<00:00:09.670> thing<00:00:09.910> called<00:00:09.940> the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
quick video about this thing called the

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.320 
quick video about this thing called the
lollipops<00:00:11.290> because<00:00:11.889> a<00:00:12.160> couple<00:00:12.850> of<00:00:13.030> months<00:00:13.210> ago

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
lollipops because a couple of months ago

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.810 
lollipops because a couple of months ago
I<00:00:13.450> asked<00:00:13.780> you<00:00:13.990> guys<00:00:14.200> in<00:00:14.470> a<00:00:14.860> video<00:00:15.100> what<00:00:15.610> do<00:00:15.730> you

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
I asked you guys in a video what do you

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.870 
I asked you guys in a video what do you
think<00:00:16.119> is<00:00:16.299> a<00:00:16.570> good<00:00:16.660> solution<00:00:17.349> for<00:00:17.529> a<00:00:17.710> very<00:00:18.099> very

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
think is a good solution for a very very

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.319 
think is a good solution for a very very
lightweight<00:00:20.099> stunt<00:00:21.099> because<00:00:21.640> sometimes<00:00:22.150> I

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
lightweight stunt because sometimes I

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.900 
lightweight stunt because sometimes I
want<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.689> travel<00:00:22.989> and<00:00:23.259> want<00:00:24.009> to<00:00:24.099> take<00:00:24.279> lighting

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
want to travel and want to take lighting

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.530 
want to travel and want to take lighting
with<00:00:25.060> me<00:00:25.210> but<00:00:25.950> something<00:00:26.950> like<00:00:27.040> this<00:00:27.279> or<00:00:27.790> what

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
with me but something like this or what

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.109 
with me but something like this or what
bigger<00:00:28.720> is<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:30.099> too<00:00:30.310> much<00:00:30.460> weight<00:00:30.759> because<00:00:30.939> I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
bigger is just too much weight because I

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.910 
bigger is just too much weight because I
need<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.329> few<00:00:31.570> stands<00:00:31.960> what<00:00:32.290> sounds<00:00:32.529> even<00:00:32.739> one

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
need a few stands what sounds even one

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.500 
need a few stands what sounds even one
of<00:00:32.950> these<00:00:33.130> is<00:00:33.370> too<00:00:33.550> much<00:00:33.730> or<00:00:34.090> what<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.270> want<00:00:34.450> to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
of these is too much or what I want to

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.680 
of these is too much or what I want to
do<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.899> so<00:00:35.829> I<00:00:36.370> asked<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.180> guys<00:00:37.329> and<00:00:37.540> you<00:00:37.660> guys

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
do and so I asked you guys and you guys

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.290 
do and so I asked you guys and you guys
told<00:00:38.290> me<00:00:38.380> about<00:00:38.620> this<00:00:38.920> thing<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:40.180> is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
told me about this thing so this is

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.600 
told me about this thing so this is
called<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.750> lollipop<00:00:41.290> it's<00:00:41.620> very

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
called the lollipop it's very

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.890 
called the lollipop it's very
lightweight<00:00:42.910> light<00:00:43.570> stand<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:45.720> sets<00:00:46.720> up

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
lightweight light stand which sets up

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.600 
lightweight light stand which sets up
like<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.800> then<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.740> goes<00:00:51.460> up

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
like that and then like this and goes up

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.420 
like that and then like this and goes up
to<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:52.000> fair<00:00:52.750> height<00:00:53.080> it's<00:00:53.320> not<00:00:53.530> it's<00:00:54.040> not<00:00:54.130> super

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
to a fair height it's not it's not super

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.460 
to a fair height it's not it's not super
tall<00:00:54.580> and<00:00:54.730> it's<00:00:55.240> intended<00:00:55.510> mini<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:55.900> a<00:00:55.930> tripod

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
tall and it's intended mini is a tripod

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.780 
tall and it's intended mini is a tripod
rather<00:00:56.680> than<00:00:56.860> a<00:00:56.890> light<00:00:57.100> stand<00:00:57.310> I<00:00:57.460> think<00:00:57.490> sort

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
rather than a light stand I think sort

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.580 
rather than a light stand I think sort
of<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.910> mix<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.240> both<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.020> same<00:00:59.260> company

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
of a mix of both and the same company

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.470 
of a mix of both and the same company
makes<00:00:59.829> one<00:01:00.579> of<00:01:00.670> these<00:01:00.880> which<00:01:01.090> is<00:01:01.120> actually

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
makes one of these which is actually

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.350 
makes one of these which is actually
larger<00:01:01.960> as<00:01:02.020> well<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.490> may<00:01:03.760> get<00:01:03.910> that<00:01:04.119> one

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
larger as well so I may get that one

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.710 
larger as well so I may get that one
it's<00:01:04.839> also<00:01:05.019> you<00:01:05.290> know<00:01:05.409> light<00:01:05.710> weight<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.720> sort

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
it's also you know light weight and sort

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.810 
it's also you know light weight and sort
of<00:01:07.780> overall<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.710> very<00:01:08.740> good<00:01:09.040> weight<00:01:09.579> to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
of overall a very good weight to

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.429 
of overall a very good weight to
usability<00:01:10.799> ratio<00:01:11.799> and<00:01:12.899> overall<00:01:13.899> a<00:01:14.049> nice

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
usability ratio and overall a nice

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.090 
usability ratio and overall a nice
system<00:01:15.039> so<00:01:15.399> this<00:01:15.640> thing<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.770> small<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.979> has<00:01:18.009> a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
system so this thing is small it has a

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.380 
system so this thing is small it has a
small<00:01:18.399> footprint<00:01:18.759> so<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:18.999> do<00:01:19.119> want<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.299> be

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
small footprint so you do want to be

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.910 
small footprint so you do want to be
careful<00:01:19.509> with<00:01:19.780> this<00:01:19.869> it's<00:01:20.350> not<00:01:20.560> something

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
careful with this it's not something

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.249 
careful with this it's not something
like<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.399> know<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.880> would<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.509> something

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
like you know you would on something

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.469 
like you know you would on something
heavy<00:01:23.469> like<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.889> you<00:01:24.310> could<00:01:24.490> put<00:01:24.639> a<00:01:24.969> light<00:01:25.450> on

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
heavy like this you could put a light on

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.760 
heavy like this you could put a light on
it<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:25.899> walk<00:01:26.109> away<00:01:26.319> from<00:01:26.499> it<00:01:26.649> and<00:01:26.679> you

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
it and just walk away from it and you

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.289 
it and just walk away from it and you
can<00:01:26.950> be<00:01:27.009> pretty<00:01:27.249> sure<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.030> not<00:01:28.179> going

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
can be pretty sure that it's not going

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.940 
can be pretty sure that it's not going
to<00:01:28.359> fall<00:01:28.569> you<00:01:28.899> know<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.109> does<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.679> a<00:01:29.740> big

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
to fall you know it does have a big

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.859 
to fall you know it does have a big
footprint<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.639> does<00:01:30.759> have<00:01:30.969> a<00:01:31.420> bit<00:01:31.840> of

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
footprint and it does have a bit of

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.230 
footprint and it does have a bit of
weight<00:01:32.109> to<00:01:32.319> it<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.499> push<00:01:32.679> it<00:01:32.799> down<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.189> then<00:01:34.119> to

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
weight to it to push it down and then to

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.649 
weight to it to push it down and then to
a<00:01:34.270> pollen<00:01:34.569> in<00:01:34.659> place<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.549> thing<00:01:36.819> doesn't

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
a pollen in place and this thing doesn't

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.139 
a pollen in place and this thing doesn't
it's<00:01:38.139> got<00:01:38.259> a<00:01:38.289> small<00:01:38.499> footprint<00:01:38.859> and<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.149> it's

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
it's got a small footprint and it's it's

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.760 
it's got a small footprint and it's it's
very<00:01:40.359> light<00:01:40.600> weight<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.259> little<00:01:41.649> bit

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
very light weight and it's a little bit

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.800 
very light weight and it's a little bit
bendy<00:01:42.219> not<00:01:42.579> too<00:01:42.729> bad<00:01:42.880> but<00:01:43.359> it<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.569> little<00:01:43.689> bit

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
bendy not too bad but it is a little bit

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.859 
bendy not too bad but it is a little bit
bendy<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.469> you<00:01:44.859> want<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.100> keep<00:01:45.549> things<00:01:45.880> like

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
bendy so you want to keep things like

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.209 
bendy so you want to keep things like
weight<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.139> here<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.469> this<00:01:47.619> could<00:01:47.829> be<00:01:47.920> used<00:01:48.009> as

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
weight on here so this could be used as

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.239 
weight on here so this could be used as
a<00:01:48.280> tripod<00:01:48.850> for<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.920> know<00:01:51.009> lightweight

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
a tripod for you know lightweight

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.059 
a tripod for you know lightweight
cameras<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:52.109> did<00:01:53.109> think<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.709> you<00:01:53.770> guys<00:01:53.920> were

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
cameras I did think that you guys were

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.679 
cameras I did think that you guys were
going<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.279> see<00:01:54.399> what<00:01:54.429> happens<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.389> this<00:01:55.479> thing

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
going to see what happens to this thing

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.010 
going to see what happens to this thing
when<00:01:55.840> we<00:01:55.959> overload<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.039> so<00:01:57.909> what<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:58.840> go

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
when we overload it and so what I go

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.010 
when we overload it and so what I go
ahead<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:01.200> big<00:02:02.200> big<00:02:02.619> lights<00:02:03.490> from<00:02:04.020> almost

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
ahead is a big big lights from almost

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.790 
ahead is a big big lights from almost
three<00:02:05.259> kilograms<00:02:05.679> of<00:02:05.979> LED<00:02:06.819> and

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
three kilograms of LED and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.180 
three kilograms of LED and
a<00:02:08.830> little<00:02:09.070> adapter<00:02:09.400> this<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.150> not<00:02:10.510> safe<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.930> do

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
a little adapter this is not safe to do

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.640 
a little adapter this is not safe to do
this<00:02:12.190> will<00:02:12.640> probably<00:02:13.230> using<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.320> like<00:02:14.440> this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
this will probably using it like this

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.180 
this will probably using it like this
would<00:02:14.980> probably<00:02:15.460> make<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.210> thing<00:02:16.360> full<00:02:16.600> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
would probably make this thing full I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.050 
would probably make this thing full I
just<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.490> show<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.700> guys<00:02:18.820> what<00:02:19.030> happens

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
just want to show you guys what happens

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.380 
just want to show you guys what happens
if<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.720> really<00:02:20.380> overload<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.820> thought<00:02:22.270> you

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
if you really overload it I thought you

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.720 
if you really overload it I thought you
guys<00:02:22.480> might<00:02:22.540> be<00:02:22.780> interested<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.410> so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
guys might be interested to see that so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.030 
guys might be interested to see that so
here<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:25.330> taking<00:02:26.290> up<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.560> weight<00:02:26.830> I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
here it is it's taking up that weight I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.940 
here it is it's taking up that weight I
wouldn't<00:02:27.550> use<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.560> mean

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
wouldn't use it like this but I mean

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.990 
wouldn't use it like this but I mean
it's<00:02:30.070> interesting<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.520> see<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.880> is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
it's interesting to see that it is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's interesting to see that it is
actually<00:02:31.630> quite<00:02:32.050> strong<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.860> like<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.670> said<00:02:33.790> it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
actually quite strong and like I said it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.880 
actually quite strong and like I said it
does<00:02:34.060> bend<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.450> little<00:02:34.540> bit<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.530> doesn't<00:02:35.770> so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
does bend a little bit but it doesn't so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.580 
does bend a little bit but it doesn't so
it<00:02:36.130> doesn't<00:02:36.520> break<00:02:36.790> or<00:02:37.060> fall<00:02:37.240> over<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.410> you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
it doesn't break or fall over and if you

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890 
it doesn't break or fall over and if you
put<00:02:38.800> any<00:02:39.070> more<00:02:39.160> than<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.970> will<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.480> this

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
put any more than this it will so this

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.710 
put any more than this it will so this
will<00:02:41.080> start<00:02:41.290> going<00:02:41.560> down<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.100> then<00:02:42.730> order

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
will start going down and then order

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.350 
will start going down and then order
just<00:02:43.900> fall<00:02:44.170> or<00:02:44.380> whatever<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:45.760> it's

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
just fall or whatever but it's

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.170 
just fall or whatever but it's
surprising<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.810> see<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.650> actually<00:02:47.680> does

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
surprising to see that it actually does

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.490 
surprising to see that it actually does
pretty<00:02:49.180> well<00:02:49.270> way<00:02:49.690> above<00:02:49.990> what<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
pretty well way above what the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
pretty well way above what the
manufacturer<00:02:51.250> recommends<00:02:51.790> us<00:02:51.940> maximum<00:02:52.510> limit

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
manufacturer recommends us maximum limit

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.730 
manufacturer recommends us maximum limit
but<00:02:55.120> then<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.420> wouldn't<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.780> safe<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.380> leave<00:02:56.560> it

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
but then it wouldn't be safe to leave it

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.530 
but then it wouldn't be safe to leave it
alone<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.090> wouldn't<00:02:58.420> walk

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
alone like that like I wouldn't walk

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.170 
alone like that like I wouldn't walk
away<00:02:58.810> from<00:02:58.990> that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
away from that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.400 
away from that
unless<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.270> didn't<00:03:01.540> care<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.900> thing<00:03:02.200> broke

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
unless I didn't care if that thing broke

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.610 
unless I didn't care if that thing broke
for<00:03:03.400> bear<00:03:03.760> lights<00:03:04.330> small<00:03:04.900> bear<00:03:05.140> lights<00:03:05.410> this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
for bear lights small bear lights this

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.610 
for bear lights small bear lights this
could<00:03:05.860> be<00:03:05.950> really<00:03:06.100> nice<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.000> stroke

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
could be really nice like just a stroke

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.360 
could be really nice like just a stroke
like<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.680> photography<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> flush<00:03:09.460> or<00:03:10.980> for<00:03:11.980> camera

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
like a photography a flush or for camera

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.640 
like a photography a flush or for camera
so<00:03:13.060> I'm<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.050> know<00:03:14.110> I'm<00:03:14.170> sure<00:03:14.230> there's<00:03:14.380> other

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
uses for this you guys might find for

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.490 
uses for this you guys might find for
example<00:03:18.450> personally<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.750> biggest<00:03:20.080> use<00:03:20.260> for

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
example personally the biggest use for

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.290 
example personally the biggest use for
this<00:03:20.650> would<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:20.920> audio<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.880> would<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.239> a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
this would be audio I would have a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.340 
this would be audio I would have a
microphone<00:03:22.660> on<00:03:22.870> here<00:03:22.989> because<00:03:23.110> I'm<00:03:23.290> like

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
microphone on here because I'm like

microphone on here because I'm like
refills<00:03:23.590> quite<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.860> lightweight<00:03:24.489> thing

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
refills quite a lightweight thing

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.090 
refills quite a lightweight thing
position<00:03:26.020> it<00:03:26.110> however<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.709> want

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
position it however I want

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.080 
position it however I want
I<00:03:27.130> could<00:03:27.280> even<00:03:27.370> position<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.880> know<00:03:27.970> like

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
I could even position it you know like

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.420 
I could even position it you know like
right<00:03:28.630> below<00:03:28.959> my<00:03:29.380> my<00:03:29.830> talent<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.310> I'm

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
right below my my talent if I'm

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.260 
right below my my talent if I'm
initiating<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.750> or<00:03:32.910> well<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.120> just

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
initiating like that or well it just

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.810 
initiating like that or well it just
gives<00:03:34.480> me<00:03:34.570> an<00:03:35.140> option<00:03:35.470> for<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.010> stand<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:36.489> very

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
gives me an option for a stand with very

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.400 
gives me an option for a stand with very
very<00:03:37.030> light<00:03:37.150> weight<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.900> can<00:03:38.050> have<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.290> my

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
very light weight that I can have in my

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.550 
very light weight that I can have in my
kit<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.880> would<00:03:40.030> still<00:03:40.330> have<00:03:40.600> heaviest

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
kit and I would still have heaviest

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.470 
kit and I would still have heaviest
stands<00:03:41.830> when<00:03:42.100> needed<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.330> it's<00:03:43.450> very

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
stands when needed but I think it's very

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.090 
stands when needed but I think it's very

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
nice that the option is that something

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.130 
nice that the option is that something

guys for the recommendation it does come
with<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.840> little<00:03:50.020> case<00:03:50.320> like<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.220> there

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
with a little case like this and there

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640 
with a little case like this and there
is<00:03:51.459> extra<00:03:51.730> space<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.270> we're<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:53.020> case<00:03:53.260> so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
is extra space and we're in the case so

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.650 
is extra space and we're in the case so
if<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:53.860> wanted<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.100> put<00:03:54.280> some<00:03:54.940> accessory<00:03:55.480> or

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.880 
if you wanted to put some accessory or
something<00:03:56.080> or<00:03:56.350> whatever<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:58.800> either<00:03:59.800> way

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
something or whatever and either way

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.100 
something or whatever and either way
this<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.370> thing<00:04:00.700> also<00:04:01.390> holds<00:04:01.690> quite<00:04:01.930> well

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
this little thing also holds quite well

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.420 
this little thing also holds quite well
this<00:04:02.890> little<00:04:03.070> tilt<00:04:03.459> thing<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:06.250> poses

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
this little tilt thing so that poses

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.150 
this little tilt thing so that poses
like<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:07.019> that's<00:04:08.019> it<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.500> then<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.709> here<00:04:08.860> we

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
like that that's it and then in here we

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.850 
like that that's it and then in here we
have

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
have

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.390 
have
a<00:04:09.890> little<00:04:10.280> net<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:11.630> clip<00:04:11.960> to<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.650> bottom

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
a little net that you clip to the bottom

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.420 
a little net that you clip to the bottom
side<00:04:13.580> of<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.540> legs<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.110> then<00:04:15.770> it<00:04:16.070> allows<00:04:16.220> you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
side of the legs and then it allows you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.670 
side of the legs and then it allows you
to<00:04:16.459> place<00:04:16.700> some<00:04:17.000> rocks<00:04:17.269> or<00:04:17.630> something<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.530> sort

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
to place some rocks or something to sort

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.250 
to place some rocks or something to sort
of<00:04:18.739> keep<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.400> held<00:04:19.609> down<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:20.120> little<00:04:20.420> more<00:04:20.750> no

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
of keep it held down a little more no

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.800 
of keep it held down a little more no
ideal<00:04:21.739> for<00:04:22.490> something<00:04:22.730> heavy<00:04:22.910> not<00:04:23.420> ideal<00:04:23.720> to

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
ideal for something heavy not ideal to

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.010 
ideal for something heavy not ideal to
be<00:04:23.990> left<00:04:24.290> alone<00:04:24.820> but<00:04:25.820> an<00:04:26.030> air<00:04:26.270> situation<00:04:26.870> where

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
be left alone but an air situation where

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.420 
be left alone but an air situation where
no<00:04:27.440> one's<00:04:27.620> going<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.800> bump<00:04:27.920> into<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.280> and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
no one's going to bump into it and

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.810 
no one's going to bump into it and
there's<00:04:28.940> no<00:04:29.030> end<00:04:29.240> then<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.650> really<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.640> would

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
there's no end then I really I would

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.120 
there's no end then I really I would
assume<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:32.720> left<00:04:33.380> alone<00:04:33.560> again

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
assume that it can be left alone again

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.610 
assume that it can be left alone again
probably<00:04:34.730> not<00:04:34.970> expecting<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.540> question<00:04:35.870> okay

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
probably not expecting a question okay

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.380 
probably not expecting a question okay
so<00:04:36.770> overall<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.610> like<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.060> thing

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390
