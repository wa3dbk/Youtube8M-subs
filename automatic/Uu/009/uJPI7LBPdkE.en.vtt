00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.240
 This is the review videos of the 30 cm 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 Slider dollys from sunrise which one 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.050
 slider and a mini camera dare for 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.050
 dslr cameras is in one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.390
 Thanks a lot to hd video shop for the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.070
 providing the slider when in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.140
 bring his videos a bit pepp 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 would like a slider is just right 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 you can switch off with a slider 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.450
 boring static shots 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.400
 make interesting moving videos 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.980
 That's why I'm showing you the 30th today 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 centimeter slider from sunrise this is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 but not just a slider but has 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 also wheels which as a smaller 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.480
 camera car for dslr or compact cameras 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.970
 what can be used immediately 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.650
 noticed is the build quality of 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.760
 Unfortunately , all but the wheels are complete 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.500
 made of aluminium 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.239
 even the screw threads are out 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.550
 aluminum reducing the wear of the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 Thread is very difficult to do that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 unfortunately, you can screwed a tripod 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.050
 so that you can record the picture 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 can adjust itself 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.500
 but if you do not have a tripod you can 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 just turn down the legs 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.950
 which are located next to the wheels 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.629
 you can easily use the slider with them 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.009
 put on the table and from there 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.440
 for example, close-ups of one 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.450
 Make object as you 30 cm to 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.729
 Slides can be some interesting 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.830
 Shoot with the slider one man 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.660
 can from left to right or from 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 but you suffer right to left 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.380
 still some other possibilities 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 But before we get to that, I want to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280

 professional movie cameras like the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 cameras from blackmagic design 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.180
 So if you have photo or video equipment 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640

 So shop.com continues with it now 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.180
 the video and the great recordings 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.610
 one with the slider and a bit 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.189
 creativity can be done you can eg 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.900
 to drive on an object with the camera 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.060
 or you can with the help of a tripod 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.770
 also drive from top to bottom 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.750
 you get an elevator effect 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.579
 very handy is that the wheels ever 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 can be screwed on and off as needed 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.080
 thus avoid unnecessary weight 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.060
 on the tripod 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.009
 the slider head and the wheels of the unfortunately 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.810
 are very well stored and allow 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.790
 to take smooth shots 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.710
 you even have the option of the wheels 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.840
 Angling to get around objects 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.820
 can drive around the strength of the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.500
 Resistance when slipping set 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.660
 there is a small screw regulator on 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 the side of the unfortunately head one has 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.520
 Therefore, an incredible number of possibilities 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.140
 sorry to use the 21 of the dolly 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.270
 unfortunately, that's perfect for everyone 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.470
