00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
i think this will be coming in 0.7 point

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.640 
i think this will be coming in 0.7 point
Oh<00:00:25.680> mainly<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.630> one<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> Pocket

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
Oh mainly because one of the Pocket

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
Oh mainly because one of the Pocket
Edition<00:00:28.710> workers<00:00:29.519> said<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.970> they're<00:00:30.179> not

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
Edition workers said that they're not

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
Edition workers said that they're not
actually<00:00:30.660> working<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.349> buckets<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
actually working on buckets at the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
actually working on buckets at the
moment<00:00:32.430> side<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.790> buckets<00:00:33.450> will<00:00:33.600> be

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
moment side I think buckets will be

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
moment side I think buckets will be
coming<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.440> will<00:00:34.500> come<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.829> 0.8

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
coming I think you will come in 0.8

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.549 
coming I think you will come in 0.8
point<00:00:35.700> 0<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.930> update<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> think

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
point 0 because in that update I think

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.959 
point 0 because in that update I think
they're<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:38.010> working<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.700> more

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
they're going to be working on like more

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.750 
they're going to be working on like more
items<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.170> blocks<00:00:40.290> hopefully<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.309> buckets

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
items and blocks hopefully but buckets

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.220 
items and blocks hopefully but buckets
are<00:00:41.940> coded<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.649> hopefully<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.850> can

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
are coded in so hopefully that they can

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
are coded in so hopefully that they can
maybe<00:00:46.230> Adam<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.370> 0.8<00:00:47.910> point<00:00:48.180> 0<00:00:48.360> or

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
maybe Adam in 0.8 point 0 or

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.270 
maybe Adam in 0.8 point 0 or
nine-point-oh<00:00:49.280> hopefully<00:00:50.449> um<00:00:52.250> with<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
nine-point-oh hopefully um with the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.270 
nine-point-oh hopefully um with the
online<00:00:53.640> multiplayer<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:55.199> there's<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.100> much

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
online multiplayer you there's not much

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
online multiplayer you there's not much
really<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.180> add<00:00:57.449> except<00:00:58.050> over<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.469> I'll

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
really just to add except over here I'll

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
really just to add except over here I'll
just<00:00:58.559> realize<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.309> says<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.180> could<00:01:00.300> buy

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just realize it says you could buy

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.790 
just realize it says you could buy
service<00:01:00.899> through<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> appstore<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
service through the appstore and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
service through the appstore and
playstore<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> purchases<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
playstore and that purchases so I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
playstore and that purchases so I
thought<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.309> something

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
thought there was going to be something

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.960 
thought there was going to be something
to<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> x<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
to do with the x because in the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.130 
to do with the x because in the
application<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.060> ifile<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.869> through<00:01:10.110> all

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
application in ifile you go through all

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.390 
application in ifile you go through all
the<00:01:10.290> pictures<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.770> stuff<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.220> there's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the pictures and stuff in there there's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.359 
the pictures and stuff in there there's
a<00:01:11.490> Buy<00:01:11.670> button<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> picture<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> by<00:01:13.770> like

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and yeah I'll do a few bands represent

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.990 
and yeah I'll do a few bands represent
when<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> comes<00:02:04.110> out<00:02:04.320> straight<00:02:04.799> away<00:02:05.000> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
when I comes out straight away so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050 
when I comes out straight away so
there's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> new<00:02:06.509> bug<00:02:06.869> fix<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.680> died<00:02:08.520> sometime

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
there's a new bug fix so died sometime

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.839 
there's a new bug fix so died sometime
shopping<00:02:09.479> around<00:02:09.569> coloring<00:02:10.140> hand<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:11.640> not

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
shopping around coloring hand that's not

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.870 
shopping around coloring hand that's not
a<00:02:11.879> big<00:02:12.390> issue<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:13.230> my

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
a big issue but my

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.490 
a big issue but my
foot<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.360> people<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.810> might<00:02:15.990> actually<00:02:16.200> be

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
foot up some people it might actually be

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.590 
foot up some people it might actually be
and<00:02:16.890> there's<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.880> some<00:02:18.090> other<00:02:18.300> plan

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
and there's just some other plan

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.310 
and there's just some other plan
features<00:02:19.080> items<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.710> blocks<00:02:21.020> camera<00:02:22.020> I

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
features items and blocks camera I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.050 
features items and blocks camera I
reckon<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.740> might<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:23.070> go<00:02:23.280> because<00:02:23.460> it's

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
reckon it might not go because it's

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.270 
reckon it might not go because it's
easier<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> screenshot<00:02:26.190> with

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
easier just to do the screenshot with

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.300 
easier just to do the screenshot with
the<00:02:26.490> home<00:02:26.730> button<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.180> sleep<00:02:27.810> button

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the home button and sleep button

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.530 
the home button and sleep button
infinite<00:02:29.310> worlds<00:02:29.640> I'll<00:02:29.790> probably<00:02:30.000> come<00:02:30.240> later

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
infinite worlds I'll probably come later

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
infinite worlds I'll probably come later
on<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> year<00:02:30.990> if<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.530> does<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.890> come<00:02:32.070> out

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
on in the year if it does to come out

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.860 
on in the year if it does to come out
there<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:32.910> infinite<00:02:33.570> worlds<00:02:33.780> will

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
there and I think infinite worlds will

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.230 
there and I think infinite worlds will
come<00:02:34.050> out<00:02:34.260> might<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.710> be<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.550> bigger<00:02:35.910> map

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
come out might just be like a bigger map

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.470 
come out might just be like a bigger map
out<00:02:36.810> soon<00:02:37.650> eventually<00:02:38.340> Redstone<00:02:39.330> Arsenal

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
out soon eventually Redstone Arsenal

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.270 
out soon eventually Redstone Arsenal
come<00:02:39.960> out<00:02:40.110> 0.9<00:02:41.100> point<00:02:41.490> 0<00:02:41.640> or<00:02:41.970> 10<00:02:42.240> point<00:02:42.570> 0<00:02:43.280> cos

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
come out 0.9 point 0 or 10 point 0 cos

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.930 
come out 0.9 point 0 or 10 point 0 cos
ya<00:02:44.820> redstone<00:02:45.390> will<00:02:45.510> be<00:02:45.600> big<00:02:45.930> arm<00:02:46.760> project<00:02:47.760> they

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
ya redstone will be big arm project they

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.310 
ya redstone will be big arm project they
might<00:02:48.120> ready<00:02:48.450> they're<00:02:48.780> probably<00:02:49.050> already

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
might ready they're probably already

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.260 
might ready they're probably already
starting<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.220> because<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.970> can't<00:02:51.180> get

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
starting on it because you can't get

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.480 
starting on it because you can't get
some<00:02:51.420> redstone<00:02:51.600> stuff<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> coding<00:02:53.040> with

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
some redstone stuff in the coding with

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.530 
some redstone stuff in the coding with
imc<00:02:54.030> Peter<00:02:55.490> so<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.790> should<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.120> interesting

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
imc Peter so that should be interesting

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.220 
imc Peter so that should be interesting
if<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.320> does<00:02:58.500> come<00:02:59.450> that<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> think<00:03:00.959> he'll<00:03:01.050> come

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
if it does come that I think he'll come

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.140 
if it does come that I think he'll come
out<00:03:01.410> too<00:03:01.680> soon<00:03:01.980> or<00:03:02.040> anything<00:03:02.840> sky<00:03:03.840> edition

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
out too soon or anything sky edition

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.480 
out too soon or anything sky edition
editions<00:03:06.150> think<00:03:06.690> that's<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
editions think that's it I think the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.390 
editions think that's it I think the
scar<00:03:08.760> tissues<00:03:09.030> will<00:03:09.209> be<00:03:09.270> like<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:10.400> sunset

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
scar tissues will be like the sunset

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.930 
scar tissues will be like the sunset
sunrise<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.530> stars<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:13.860> maybe<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:14.400> some

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
sunrise and stars or maybe just some

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.590 
sunrise and stars or maybe just some
moons<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.690> there<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.400> yeah<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.120> reckon<00:03:18.450> I'll

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
moons in there so yeah I reckon I'll

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.100 
moons in there so yeah I reckon I'll
come<00:03:18.870> eventually<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:21.000> with<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.870> fancy

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
come eventually in with the fancy

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.070 
come eventually in with the fancy
graphics<00:03:22.580> big<00:03:23.580> noise<00:03:23.880> probably<00:03:24.750> turned<00:03:24.930> them

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
graphics big noise probably turned them

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.220 
graphics big noise probably turned them
off<00:03:26.209> customizable<00:03:27.209> skins<00:03:29.030> johane<00:03:30.030> or<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:31.080> of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
off customizable skins johane or one of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.920 
off customizable skins johane or one of
them<00:03:31.350> did<00:03:31.500> sweet<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:32.040> day<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.610> skins

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
them did sweet that day like the skins

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.210 
them did sweet that day like the skins
one<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.140> workers<00:03:34.410> don't<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.130> was

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
one of the workers don't think it was

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.430 
one of the workers don't think it was
Joe<00:03:35.340> hand<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.700> they<00:03:35.790> he<00:03:36.000> get<00:03:36.360> wasn't<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.320> he

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
Joe hand that they he get wasn't that he

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.979 
Joe hand that they he get wasn't that he
tweeted<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.070> he<00:03:38.550> preferred<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.239> change

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
tweeted that he preferred to change

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.580 
tweeted that he preferred to change
skins<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.830> peace<00:03:41.040> seen<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.489> xbox<00:03:42.350> but<00:03:43.350> I

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.370 
skins like in peace seen on xbox but I
reckon<00:03:44.010> with<00:03:44.400> Minecraft<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.600> Pocket<00:03:46.320> Edition

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
reckon with Minecraft on Pocket Edition

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.440 
reckon with Minecraft on Pocket Edition
I<00:03:46.769> reckon<00:03:47.010> I'll<00:03:47.100> have<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.640> Xbox<00:03:48.180> cuz

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
I reckon I'll have to be like Xbox cuz

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.900 
I reckon I'll have to be like Xbox cuz
there's<00:03:48.810> no<00:03:49.100> actual<00:03:50.100> way<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.430> ifile<00:03:50.880> I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
there's no actual way to get ifile I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.690 
there's no actual way to get ifile I
should<00:03:51.330> use<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> computer<00:03:53.010> or

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
should use the one on the computer or

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.090 
should use the one on the computer or
the<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.200> actual<00:03:55.920> see<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.420> yeah

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
the one in the actual see do so yeah

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.979 
the one in the actual see do so yeah
caves<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.430> reckon<00:03:59.760> won't<00:03:59.940> come<00:04:00.150> too<00:04:00.330> late<00:04:00.360> zero

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
caves I reckon won't come too late zero

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.729 
caves I reckon won't come too late zero
point<00:04:01.230> nine<00:04:01.519> point<00:04:02.519> eight<00:04:02.610> or<00:04:02.790> ten<00:04:03.030> point<00:04:03.239> oh

maybe<00:04:04.739> before<00:04:05.400> redstone<00:04:05.970> comes<00:04:06.360> out<00:04:06.690> because

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
maybe before redstone comes out because

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.580 
maybe before redstone comes out because
this<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.620> probably<00:04:08.160> be<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> big<00:04:08.850> problem<00:04:09.030> and

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
this is probably be a big problem and

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.500 
this is probably be a big problem and
they'll<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.709> heap<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:11.040> bugs<00:04:11.310> with<00:04:11.700> caves<00:04:12.060> with

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
they'll be heap of bugs with caves with

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.570 
they'll be heap of bugs with caves with
the<00:04:12.660> older<00:04:12.930> devices<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.500> lag<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:13.980> crush<00:04:14.250> and

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
the older devices of lag and crush and

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.909 
the older devices of lag and crush and
yeah<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.470> replacement<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.500> nether<00:04:16.709> reactor

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
yeah and replacement of nether reactor

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.729 
yeah and replacement of nether reactor
that<00:04:17.310> will<00:04:17.430> be<00:04:17.580> way<00:04:17.820> better<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:19.350> hopefully

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that will be way better so hopefully

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.270 
that will be way better so hopefully
they<00:04:19.919> can<00:04:19.979> replace<00:04:20.669> nether<00:04:21.030> reactor<00:04:21.269> and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
they can replace nether reactor and

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.690 
they can replace nether reactor and
hopefully<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.580> does

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
hopefully that does

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.210 
hopefully that does
open<00:04:25.020> because<00:04:26.020> another<00:04:26.290> actor<00:04:26.650> does<00:04:26.860> kind<00:04:27.130> of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
open because another actor does kind of

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.990 
open because another actor does kind of
suck<00:04:27.430> with<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.940> arm<00:04:28.350> giant<00:04:29.760> nether<00:04:30.760> act<00:04:31.950> like

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
suck with the arm giant nether act like

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.760 
suck with the arm giant nether act like
massive<00:04:34.000> mess<00:04:34.240> around<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.200> yeah<00:04:35.560> that

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
massive mess around it so yeah that

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.430 
massive mess around it so yeah that
would<00:04:35.860> be<00:04:35.890> good<00:04:36.220> if<00:04:36.280> they<00:04:36.490> change<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.030> yeah

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
would be good if they change this yeah

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.720 
would be good if they change this yeah
that<00:04:38.440> would<00:04:38.590> be<00:04:40.590> update<00:04:41.590> VF<00:04:41.920> seven-point<00:04:42.430> self
