00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.939
 in this part we will talk about the telephone contact that precedes interviews 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.210
 I work a very important moment that affects the approach to the interview of 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.139
 work 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.189
 the interview in fact starts right from the phone call having between tac and receive a beautiful 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.470
 day unexpectedly the phone rings and on the other side there is the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.570
 recruiter who, after viewing your curriculum vitae, decides to call you 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.630
 to make an appointment for a cognitive meeting 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.000
 even the phone call is important because the recruiter understands from 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 tone of voice which type of candidate meets 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.150
 I make a small parenthesis on the selectors 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.500
 recruiters are well-trained 80% graduate in psychology and the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.920
 remaining graduate in other subjects 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.270
 most have done a master of cumane resources so states that you don't 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.530
 find yourself in front of any person 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.000
 hall is telling the truth on - 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.810
 by telephone contact already understand who you are if you know how to communicate they want to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.760
 work and more 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.070
 therefore when you receive a call 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.909
 it is essential to speak with enthusiasm to listen to what they tell us and to take 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.180
 a note is paper money 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.350
 concerning information relating to the interview 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.390
 once you have pinned the address to the company name e 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.560
 irresponsible with which you will do the interview you will have to ask a question dem 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.520
 precise 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.110
 which you will need to prepare yourself and to avoid wasting time 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190
 the question is 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.130
 it kindly reminds me and which wurk figure is sought 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.490
 if the figure you are looking for a number is in line with what you that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.370
 you are looking for and we are not interested. the clinic invitation 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.299
 thank you but I'm not interested in a role like this 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.550
 tv evening is a waste of time 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.470
 sync the answer to satisfy thank you greetings reiterating date and time 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 address 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.520
 be careful because it could happen that the day you are staring at the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.419
 interview 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.279
 you are busy so you can ask if there is a possibility to evaluate 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.840
 another date but be careful with expressing little interest 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:25.899
 in this case the selector does not have corderie b and a second appointment
