00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.199
 I am everything to him

 at the beginning of my career, I simply 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.369
 I wanted it just a little bit 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.039
 with 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.729
 in an hour, of course, that is 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.920
 works 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.220
 package 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.610
 usually 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 he 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.260
 at the end of the year 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.100

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.150
 did it happen to use new 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 return children in artek 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 baku apa 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 let's go ahead 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 respectively 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.610
 dollars for the population 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.110
 in the second half 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.110
 do not think that I can believe 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 more than 7 million 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.620
 don't like you here when 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.360
 in adopted by me 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.520
 this is 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 then you have to sell
