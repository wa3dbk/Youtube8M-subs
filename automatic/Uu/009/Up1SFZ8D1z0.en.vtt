00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.860
 described by some as the game more 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.120
 terrifying of the last years fight 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.590
 night at fredys is a title 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.720
 independent that starts from a premise 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.580
 distinctive to create an atmosphere of 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.710
 oppressive terror with just the right amount of 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.660
 elements in its simplicity is its 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.550
 effectiveness and maybe that's why the trilogy 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.109
 of scott games caused a has reached 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.300
 very high levels of popularity in 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.800
 youtube as your pizzeria currently 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.480
 this second best known throughout the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.640
 world with permission from domino's pizza 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.320
 pizzeria pizzeria clear today 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.789
 we bring 5 reasons why the saga 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.210
 fight night and freddie has become so 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.210
 popular 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.040
 white knight fredys is an adventure 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.870
 point and click with elements of 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.300
 survival horror developed by a single 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.980
 type is with cause in the we we take 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.390
 the role of a security guard who 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.160
 he is in charge of watching over his day 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.830
 night a fictional pizzeria called 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 freddy fibers pizza that has the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.949
 peculiarity that animates the holidays 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.110
 Children with creepy 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.790
 animatronics robots with aspect of 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.410
 adorable stuffed animal that seem to become a 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.780
 little naughty when darkness comes 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.699
 at night do not ask about this menu 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.280
 in domino's pizza they are better at 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.780
 the ingredients given in Freddie fans 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.830
 bears pizza we do not have to move from 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.090
 room in room for 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.250
 make sure everything is still in its 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.720
 site but we can only use 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.160
 the cameras scattered throughout the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.080
 establishment to take control 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.700
 of the place is in this way much more 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.140
 accessible to everyone because 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.550
 our position is always the same and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 just change the camera that we want 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.130
 observe there resides part of its charm 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.660
 It is easy to understand for everyone 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.800
 and its main mechanics looks like 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.690
 pretty much to the pastime of the 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.789
 differences we have to take into account 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.259
 that has changed in each instance because 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.310
 things start to get a little 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.310
 turbid in a short time 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.539
 the premise then it is very simple to change 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.720
 camera to camera and get to arrive with 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.730
 life the next day 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.290
 and under that premise the 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.480
 main weapon that we have to our 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.890
 please the energy that descends 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.320
 continuously and that we must manage 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.880
 well to use lights and all doors 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.170
 necessary for the purpose of 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 keep us safe from the animatronics 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.950
 in this way the player not only 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.110
 faces the threat of stuffed animals 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.940
 murderers but to the consequences of their 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.890
 own clumsiness administering the energy 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.600
 that can give us more of a dislike if 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.980
 we get a little nervous and we start 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.100
 press buttons as if there were no 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.100
 morning 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.040
 also highlights the design of all the 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.599
 game with a style that recalls 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.609
 graphic adventures of the early 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.409
 2000 and that by using teddy bears 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.239
 of stuffed animal conveys a very uneasy 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.189
 uncomfortable who does not have any memories 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.620
 adorable and nostalgic with her teddy 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.060
 turn by night san fÃ©lix plays a little 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.519
 with that memory full of love and what 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.900
 transforms here into our biggest threat 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.370
 in that way and thanks in part to the fact 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.650
 that we basically dedicate ourselves to 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.419
 monitor different monitors the changes 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.129
 they are static but with much more fright 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.230
 effective changes camera and 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.750
 suddenly you will see fog you will hear a 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.950
 sound a shadow that was not a 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.950
 stuffed animal staring 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.930
 Part of the success of fight night fredys 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.030
 resides in the fact that our 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.500
 mobility is reduced we only depend on 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.900
 a few monitors to know what 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.370
 is happening the game puts us in the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.319
 most vulnerable situation nothing more 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.689
 start because the introductions and the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.400
 tutorials shine by their absence only 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.069
 we can close doors and turn on lights 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.930
 to avoid the siege of stuffed animals and 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.540
 we must do it conscientiously so as not to 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.069
 exhaust all available energy like this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.299
 that the player is always in position 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.190
 vulnerable and in constant tension 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.750
 key factors that ignite the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.940
 curiosity and the morbid of more and more 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.590
 players in the second game the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.269
 mechanics is still the same but with 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.220
 the peculiarity that there are no doors 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.739
 so we are much more exposed 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.450
 to the attack that yes it is necessary to make clear that 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.950
 although it is a game of great tension the 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.409
 scares only appear if we play in a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.670
 ineffective so what really 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.670
 terrifying is to play more 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.290
 and the worst of all is that nobody knows what 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.180
 they are exactly those stuffed animals 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.190
 robotized that star the games 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.050
 according to the guy who talks to us on the phone 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.370
 in games and that is our only 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.140
 contact with another living being 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.150
 animatronics are very advanced robots 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.190
 with lots of mechanical problems today 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.470
 that is that maybe the theory is a lot 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.480
 more creepy according to some pieces 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.220
 of newspaper distributed by game five 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.320
 children disappeared mysteriously in 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.579
 the pizzeria so many speculate 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 with which in reality their souls have 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.080
 possessed to these mechanical bugs 6 and 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.000
 white knight sand fredys could be a 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.320
 story of infernal possession set 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.630
 in a pizzeria with problems 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.940
 financial and incidentally has done 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.380
 Some foxes are true or not the truth is 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.120
 that ambiguity in its approach 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.370
 has run rivers of ink in 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.050
 internet and is one of the reasons why 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.630
 that this trilogy of games has become 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 so popular 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.560
 and all these reasons come together in the 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.090
 main reason why the game is 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.100
 has become fashionable not only is that its 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.810
 price is affordable but that is 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.310
 fun to see how others play so 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.440
 which is perfect for streaming 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.000
 transmit items something they have done 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.620
 some of the most popular youtubers 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.020
 of the world and that you may see in this 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.550
 same channel this year because of its 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.050
 Simplicity the viewer understands 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.910
 perfectly what is happening in 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.500
 the screen at all times and can 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.960
 join any game having the 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.430
 feeling that he is at the controls 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.290
 In other words, it looks like a game made 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.210
 tailored for the let's play may 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.430
 looking at it is not your decision to change to such 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.330
 or which camera but we assure you that the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.330
 scares you take them

 what did you think of you? 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.660

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.620
 video like this and others that we are 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.560
 preparing with more youtubers we will 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.660
 to be a channel of fear 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.960
 had to make the system happy day to 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.960
 everyone
