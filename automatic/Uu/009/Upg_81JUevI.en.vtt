00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 Like I 'm going to cook the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 drink 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 remembering that complementary feeding 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.549
 is initiated in the sixth month of life, and that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.910
 this power the call of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.289
 complementary because still the baby 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 continues to receive breastmilk 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.599
 remember that until then he never had 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.689
 contact with no other taste than the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.309
 milk and now it will start to be 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.110
 presented daily to new flavors 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 How do I prepare the first one? 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.000
 My baby's pinafore 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.070
 Please Keep the consistency of baby food has 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 be a very similar consistency 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.559
 with mashed pork because our design 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.969
 He has no tooth, he does not know what to do. 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.629
 do with the food you go 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 put in his mouth he never ate 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.539
 and how I prepare and if for example the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.550
 or the first 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.680
 to be offered by 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 our babies they should be made with 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.210
 a single vegetable because a single 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.479
 because the baby can do this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.420
 that it will be presented to the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.210
 different flavors and you mom already 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.119
 Can you see what he likes best? 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.450
 or less like what he will accept 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.759
 You'd better have a little more. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.430
 working to make the acceptance 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 after cooking my vegetables 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.960
 preferably in the steam 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.689
 I'll then either knead them as a fork 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.860
 which is a better recommendation or pass 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.210
 them through the sieve 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.729
 After I've done it, I'm going to get it. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.090
 That's what I'm missing and what's left . 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.649
 so offer it to my baby while 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.390
 What should I offer? 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.390
 The first time I'm going to give the baby 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.170
 A little, because obviously he will not. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.540
 eat a spoon two tablespoon at most 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.760
 because he will probably refuse and 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.170
 from now on we 'll have to have 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 patience and windows is offering this 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.920
 slowly for babies good 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.490
 we then move from the phase of introducing 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.310
 baby and now our baby has started 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.160
 to lose teeth and has already set 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.020
 has already become accustomed to several flavors 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.660
 were offered there 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.350
 so now mothers we have to start 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.650
 vary in the consistency of food 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.990
 offered because in consistency 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.150
 what is the importance of evaluating 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.990
 consistency of the food offered by the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.610
 bb 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.740
 Good, we need to improve or increase. 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.590
 the consistency of the machine so that 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.340
 Babies learn the first to chew the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.470
 to swallow and that they develop muscles 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.040
 of the jaw region 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.550
 therefore, is this transition between 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.840
 Mourinho and comidinha with consistency is 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.390
 very important for the development of 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.670
 moral of our baby 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.970
 this little pussy you're seeing there in the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:22.550
 The screen is a small piece made with a 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.709
 shredded beef rice and cabbage 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.120
 the babies of the own at home usually 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.760
 love this page 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.680
 after this second phase of introduction 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.080
 fight that the little stage then 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 still mixed with a food with a 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.200
 little more consistent with a consistency 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.420
 little mashed potatoes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.750
 we have to think that our baby 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.360
 is growing and therefore one hour he 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.989
 will have to eat the food that we 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 calls for family food because it is then 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.420
 we have to start making the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.000
 transition between pasty foods or 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.670
 very doughy in food and those who have 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.849
 more consistency or food 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.190
 normal and the food should be offered was 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.590
 separately 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.830
 so separately the rice beans 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.890
 vegetables meat one thing we do not 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.250
 You can forget all this or cut it well. 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.340
 small or frayed because even 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.490
 with teeth the number of teeth that 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.090
 the babies have are very small and they 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.540
 are still learning how to chew and 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.290
 swallow these foods but they will 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.310
 then start eating family food 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.220
 good 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.410
 preparing the food and now you 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.530
 You must be wondering, I'm going to have 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.890
 what to do every day 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:56.090
 prepare cream prepare by and prepare 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.410
 Comidinha every day but do not have time and 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.550
 work out 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:06.280
 may I store this will be 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.280
 that I can freeze baby food
