that's still the case for more than
three<00:00:30.240> monitors<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.349> Sapphire<00:00:31.800> has<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
three monitors but Sapphire has a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
directly to the card and that's the car
we're<00:00:38.820> using<00:00:38.969> today<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.899> Sapphire<00:00:40.320> flex

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we're using today the Sapphire flex

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
we're using today the Sapphire flex
family<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> unique<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.239> allows<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
family is unique in that it allows you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
family is unique in that it allows you
to<00:00:42.809> connect<00:00:43.260> three<00:00:43.530> DVI<00:00:43.980> monitors<00:00:44.520> in

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to connect three DVI monitors in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.959 
to connect three DVI monitors in
affinity<00:00:45.660> directly<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> card<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.700> first

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
affinity directly to the card the first

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
affinity directly to the card the first
two<00:00:48.210> monitors<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.780> connected<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> DVI

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
two monitors are connected to the DVI

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.639 
two monitors are connected to the DVI
connectors<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> bracket<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.079> third<00:00:52.350> one

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
connectors on the bracket the third one

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
connectors on the bracket the third one
is<00:00:52.860> connected<00:00:53.610> via<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> simple<00:00:54.300> passive

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
is connected via a simple passive

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.529 
is connected via a simple passive
adapter<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> HDMI<00:00:56.280> outlet<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> card

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
adapter to the HDMI outlet on the card

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.410 
adapter to the HDMI outlet on the card
so<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:59.010> directly<00:00:59.460> connect<00:00:59.850> three<00:01:00.059> DVI

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so we can directly connect three DVI

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.670 
so we can directly connect three DVI
monitors<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.370> setup<00:01:02.370> eyefinity<00:01:03.530> since<00:01:04.530> we

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
monitors and setup eyefinity since we

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
monitors and setup eyefinity since we
first<00:01:04.890> introduced<00:01:05.489> eyefinity<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.570> have

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
first introduced eyefinity there have

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
first introduced eyefinity there have
been<00:01:06.750> quite<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> few<00:01:07.110> changes<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> drivers

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
been quite a few changes to the drivers

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.820 
been quite a few changes to the drivers
and<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> user<00:01:09.360> interface<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.530> now

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and to the user interface which is now

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.640 
and to the user interface which is now
called<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> AMD<00:01:11.790> vision<00:01:12.210> control<00:01:12.450> center<00:01:13.020> so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
called the AMD vision control center so

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530 
called the AMD vision control center so
what<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.970> open<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
what I'm going to do is just open up the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
what I'm going to do is just open up the
menus<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> setup<00:01:16.860> Eyefinity<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.939> three

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
menus and setup Eyefinity on this three

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
menus and setup Eyefinity on this three
monitor<00:01:18.630> system<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.229> today<00:01:20.119> first<00:01:21.119> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
operation has created my affinity group

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
operation has created my affinity group
for<00:02:04.979> me<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.759> probably<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> the

for<00:02:11.270> rearranging<00:02:12.270> them

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
for rearranging them

it<00:02:13.739> says<00:02:14.099> here<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.610> display<00:02:15.030> arrangement

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
it says here is the display arrangement

displayed blue and again and that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.229 
displayed blue and again and that
rearranges<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.220> displays<00:02:32.610> into<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.000> correct

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
rearranges the displays into the correct

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.839 
rearranges the displays into the correct
order<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:34.379> we<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.430> we've<00:02:35.549> got

easy<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.900> set<00:04:23.170> up<00:04:23.380> now<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.920> it's<00:04:24.250> not

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
easy to set up now and it's not

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.280 
easy to set up now and it's not
expensive<00:04:24.670> because<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.480> can<00:04:25.630> use<00:04:25.840> three

expensive because you can use three

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.920 
expensive because you can use three
standard<00:04:26.740> deviations<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:28.210> everybody<00:04:28.720> can

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
standard deviations so everybody can
