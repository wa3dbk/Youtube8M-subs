00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
a world with no honeybees and so I've

duty because I believe that that really
stresses<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.190> bees<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.600> hives<00:00:51.899> are

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
stresses the bees so all my hives are
