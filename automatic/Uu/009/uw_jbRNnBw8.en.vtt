think<00:03:37.890> i<00:03:38.069> was<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.609> it's<00:03:38.940> very<00:03:39.030> uh<00:03:39.500> very

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
think i was going to it's very uh very

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.800 
think i was going to it's very uh very
drama<00:03:40.829> heavy<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.340> don't<00:03:42.000> assay<00:03:42.209> drama<00:03:42.510> heavy

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
drama heavy I don't assay drama heavy

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.640 
drama heavy I don't assay drama heavy
but<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:43.260> interesting<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.370> intriguing<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
but it's interesting it's intriguing and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.979 
but it's interesting it's intriguing and
it<00:03:46.650> has<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:46.889> good<00:03:47.100> pace<00:03:47.340> there<00:03:48.150> isn't<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.630> lot<00:03:48.810> of

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
it has a good pace there isn't a lot of

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.520 
it has a good pace there isn't a lot of
slowness<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.160> which<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.609> um<00:03:51.530> because

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
slowness to it which I like um because

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
slowness to it which I like um because
anytime<00:03:52.829> there's<00:03:53.400> some<00:03:53.790> sort<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.120> story

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
anytime there's some sort of a story

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.009 
anytime there's some sort of a story
where<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.380> want<00:03:55.560> answers<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> then<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.480> slows

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
where you want answers and then it slows

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.809 
where you want answers and then it slows
down<00:03:58.049> for<00:03:58.739> too<00:03:58.889> long<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.370> just<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.790> don't

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
down for too long you just you don't

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.240 
down for too long you just you don't
care<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.630> keep<00:04:00.780> reading<00:04:01.139> at<00:04:01.230> least<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.500> don't<00:04:01.560> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
care to keep reading at least I don't so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.530 
care to keep reading at least I don't so
I<00:04:02.670> was<00:04:02.880> really<00:04:03.030> excited<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:04.109> so<00:04:04.470> far<00:04:04.709> anyway

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
I was really excited that so far anyway

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.699 
I was really excited that so far anyway
when<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.660> want<00:04:06.959> answers<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.530> don't

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
when you want answers you don't

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.289 
when you want answers you don't
necessarily<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.400> them<00:04:08.609> but<00:04:08.850> there's

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
necessarily get them but there's

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.620 
necessarily get them but there's
progress<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:10.049> see<00:04:10.530> things<00:04:11.250> happening<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:12.120> it
