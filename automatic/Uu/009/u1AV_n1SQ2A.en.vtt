00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
sorry if that just went full screen I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
sorry if that just went full screen I
just<00:00:52.440> covered<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> full<00:00:53.100> screen<00:00:53.340> mode<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
just covered this full screen mode in

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.430 
just covered this full screen mode in
this<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.780> look

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this so I don't know if it will look

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
this so I don't know if it will look
better<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.070> full<00:00:56.219> screen<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.670> i<00:00:56.850> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
better if it's full screen so i just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.970 
better if it's full screen so i just
made<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> full<00:00:57.629> screen<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.079> we'll<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.739> because

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
made a full screen and we'll see because

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
made a full screen and we'll see because
usually<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> record<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> square<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
usually have to record the square and of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.219 
usually have to record the square and of
Z<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.399> expands<00:01:02.910> incident<00:01:03.359> graphics<00:01:03.809> Miami's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Z then expands incident graphics Miami's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
Z then expands incident graphics Miami's
got<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.619> maybe<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.949> way<00:01:05.129> might<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:05.909> better<00:01:06.330> if

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
got so maybe this way might be better if

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.740 
got so maybe this way might be better if
I<00:01:06.689> sem<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.409> always<00:01:07.920> guys<00:01:07.950> tournament<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> still

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
get that then we have do glau I think

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.340 
get that then we have do glau I think
it's<00:03:31.120> how<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.299> pronounce<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:33.480> do<00:03:34.480> now<00:03:34.780> he

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
it's how you pronounce it and do now he

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.530 
it's how you pronounce it and do now he
is<00:03:35.500> good<00:03:35.799> defending<00:03:36.430> sense<00:03:36.670> but<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.239> rest<00:03:37.420> was

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
is good defending sense but the rest was

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.509 
is good defending sense but the rest was
