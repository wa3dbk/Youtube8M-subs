00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.499
 hello friends this is a small example 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.130
 how to use the tupi program 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.089
 for before performing 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.889
 tumini nde rotation 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.159
 we are going to 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.519
 make a small example 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.779
 where we go to the car 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.409
 the concepts of exploitation ebit min 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.579
 the first thing I'm going to do that and have a dinner 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.929
 that previously they already believe 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.169
 Burian insert it through the library account 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.089
 It takes a while to load but as nothing we have it ready 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.300
 we can start working 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 in the area of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 of the objects 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.480
 if we want to move 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 here and charge 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.030
 buoy 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.510
 minimize 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.480
 the interface a bit 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 to form better 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.560
 but the designer will go where he marked his world once there 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.730
 returns the bookstore and begins the vision to 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.000
 the objects that were in that stadium 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.360
 this particular example is the quasi-like simulation of a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.340
 of a small hurricane 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.100
 so what I'm going to do is take three objects and I'm going to put them 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.110
 to turn inside the hurricane 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.040
 basically that's it 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 then the first meter was field 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 I'm going to climb a little 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 I'm going to move I'm here to gain some space 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.010
 the second objective insert 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.130
 the sun 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.500
 the marranito 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 I'm going to put here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 I was climbing a little 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.050
 more or less 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.750
 i the last object that I am going to disseminate 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.880
 It is a great merit 1 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.690
 that will be 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.680
 spinning 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.900
 in the middle 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.490
 of the hurricane 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.090
 lescano too 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.230
 a measure that 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.589
 most comfortable table 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.899
 I will place in the center 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.139
 this object is going to rotate on its own axis while 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.859
 the little cow 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.979
 and the marranito are going to be 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.949
 percent doing circles around 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.849
 so 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.489
 I already have the stage and I already have the crazy objects and do next is 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.489
 apply the rotation twin 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:33.369
 for it 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.799
 I have to go to tumen city menu to choose end of rotation 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.760
 clarified that everything apply your protest while I'm going to start 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.760
 with the farmer 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:53.669
 but the tubing farmer loa hiciano and is with the object in this case the center 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.219
 selected properties 5 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.430
 he's always looking green 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.839
 pivot 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:06.249
 or is the reference point on which the object to rotate I will leave it 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.939
 right there for what 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.939
 the roth doll in his own team 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.019
 I will choose to finish in frame 72 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.299
 all those parameters I'm going to leave them 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.689
 unmodified 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.629
 the speed in degrees that goes away dies 5 degrees I chose the number 72 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.569
 to five degrees 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.799
 percent generate 360 ​​degrees that is 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 the municipality zamora a complete return 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.209
 I proceed to apply tourism 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.139
 once applied then I'm going to 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.269
 to generate the twins for the vaquita 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.109
 and for the marranito 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.109
 we started with labaka 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.809
 selected the object 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:01.469
 it's like properties 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.469
 and this time 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.559
 with the 'wizard' bush 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.279
 I will select the pivot point and sell it downtown street 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.090
 when modifying the pivot point what will happen is that the vaquita goes to 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.709
 perform 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.989
 this movement that is made with the mouse 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.019
 I'm going to choose the same parameters that the previous one had 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.680
 and I'm going to rotate clockwise that is 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.169
 like the hand of the clock 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.169
 applied 30 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.990
 i continue 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 with the marranito 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.240
 Mallard 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.990
 ascó or properties 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.720
 and I can use the same values ​​except that I'm going to make a variation 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.759
 the lahore address will apply counterclockwise to say that 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.849
 will estimate milestone 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.870
 is going to move in this direction 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.999
 additionally humor tamim the pivot and place it in the center 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.349
 to make this movement 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.020
 very well with abc defined the values 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.400
 applied the fifth 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.139
 I repeat percent and that create a tourism for each one the objects are already 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.379
 created 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.779
 then the animation is ready to visualize it then I'm going to 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.539
 player i 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.080
 I just tell you how they show it 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.080
 Well, let's review the result 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.229
 Added a small example of how to use the rotating train 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.580
 I hope you have fun using it and that you make your own animations many 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.750
 Thank you
