00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I've broken up into parts you'll

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
I've broken up into parts you'll
understand<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.440> easier<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.670> always

do so let's just get started right so
the<00:00:42.660> first<00:00:42.809> bit<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.440> summoning<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.040> so

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the first bit is just summoning out so

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
the first bit is just summoning out so
summon<00:00:44.700> fireworks<00:00:45.360> rocket<00:00:45.719> entity<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> then

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
summon fireworks rocket entity and then

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
summon fireworks rocket entity and then
we've<00:00:47.250> got<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.610> coordinates<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.600> one

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
we've got the coordinates which is one

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.720 
we've got the coordinates which is one
above<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> command<00:00:49.469> block<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.449> and

box<00:01:04.559> rocket<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> z<00:01:05.010> coordinates<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:05.880> in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
box rocket and z coordinates and then in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.250 
box rocket and z coordinates and then in
a<00:01:06.119> set<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> calibration<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.020> we've<00:01:07.110> got

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
a set of calibration so we've got

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.719 
a set of calibration so we've got
lifetime<00:01:08.070> :<00:01:08.760> 25<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.710> means<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.400> live

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lifetime : 25 so that means it will live

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
lifetime : 25 so that means it will live
for<00:01:12.030> 25<00:01:12.299> ticks<00:01:13.010> which<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.220> 1.25<00:01:15.090> seconds<00:01:15.930> if

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
for 25 ticks which is 1.25 seconds if

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
for 25 ticks which is 1.25 seconds if
I'm<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.290> mistaken<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.250> press<00:01:17.460> this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
I'm not mistaken so if I press this

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.420 
I'm not mistaken so if I press this
button<00:01:18.229> you'll<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.409> summoned<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.130> fly

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
rockin to the coordinates lifetime 25

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.760 
rockin to the coordinates lifetime 25
and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> new<00:01:30.960> tank<00:01:31.170> fireworks

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
brackets we've got ID : 401 and then

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.450 
brackets we've got ID : 401 and then
count<00:01:37.710> 1<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.619> fireworks<00:01:41.159> item

for<00:02:45.300> explosions<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.340> flicker<00:02:47.760> :<00:02:48.330> one

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
for explosions we have a flicker : one

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.009 
for explosions we have a flicker : one
and<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:50.100> that's<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.670> an<00:02:51.120> effect<00:02:51.570> that

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
and I think that's for an effect that

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.580 
and I think that's for an effect that
goes<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.450> I've<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.840> sets<00:02:55.050> one<00:02:55.290> for

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
goes on it so I've got that sets one for

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.280 
goes on it so I've got that sets one for
true<00:02:56.750> now<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.810> can't<00:02:58.110> actually<00:02:58.459> spawn<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.760> one

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
true now I can't actually spawn this one

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.960 
true now I can't actually spawn this one

craft<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.459> crash<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.380> missing

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
craft will crash so it's just missing

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.229 
craft will crash so it's just missing
some<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.070> required<00:03:08.400> tags<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.090> some

some of the required tags and for some

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.670 
some of the required tags and for some
reason<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.510> crashes<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.470> anyway<00:03:12.290> now<00:03:13.290> on

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
reason that crashes it so anyway now on

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.860 
reason that crashes it so anyway now on
the<00:03:13.920> end<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.450> end<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.630> what<00:03:15.780> we

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the end we have on the end of what we

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.000 
the end we have on the end of what we
have<00:03:16.079> we<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.209> trail<00:03:18.209> :<00:03:19.110> one<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.739> that's<00:03:19.920> just

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
have we have trail : one and that's just

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.580 
have we have trail : one and that's just
another<00:03:20.340> effect<00:03:20.760> I'm<00:03:20.940> pretty<00:03:21.150> sure<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:22.470> right

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
another effect I'm pretty sure all right

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.390 
another effect I'm pretty sure all right
so<00:03:22.980> then<00:03:23.630> we've<00:03:24.630> also<00:03:24.810> got<00:03:24.959> type<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.280> end

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
so then we've also got type on the end

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.069 
so then we've also got type on the end
of<00:03:26.489> what<00:03:26.610> we<00:03:26.700> had<00:03:26.880> :<00:03:27.780> -<00:03:28.040> which<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> star<00:03:30.090> and
