00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:09.620
 hello guys for as long as you have left 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.509
 find out that this f fd modifier is very 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.650
 important modifier we have already considered but 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.110
 and washed the band 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.600
 they are easy to manage there just 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.359
 change the parameters they themselves will do everything 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.490
 so here is an option if you have with 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.679
 creativity no problem and you 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.210
 want to bend something out of objects 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.160
 obviously there are others for that 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.140
 programs where it is much more convenient 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.419
 everybody squeeze the chest and everything else but 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.309
 if you need to make this weight maxi 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.160
 for example to this is an architectural detail to and 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.020
 all things here I am such modifiers 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.260
 you canâ€™t use my problems with it 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.930
 But I will tell you how it is used. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:52.570
 I have one box here that options 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.570
 which is why so here 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.770
 great let it be our box 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.200
 so you can remove the grid, we no longer 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.120
 useful and so are looking for the fd modifier 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.760
 find here and so there are two for two on 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.740
 two and so on 3-4 and specifically for 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.460
 boxes for cylinders and not them 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.420
 consider this is not our choice let's 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 234 no more like it now 3 this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 the grid is condemned for example 3 by 3 by 3 then 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:34.410
 there are three 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:38.160
 1 by 1 2 and 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 3 by 3 by 3 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.240
 that is, a total of 27 points is obtained 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.119
 also gizmo 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.979
 but peculiar and it is called lattice 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.720
 that is, the grille is also not quite gizmo 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.570
 because there are some peaks 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.890
 these are control points and here we are 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 edit exactly the position of these 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.030
 vertices parameter here is also a bit of us in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.290
 Most will call all the top and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.950
 rezzed button will not be particularly 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.520
 consider here means let's 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.909
 let's change it so that the grid can be clearly seen 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.200
 green again 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.739
 okay that means moving 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.010
 tool movement control points 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.650
 take any point let's move and very 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.209
 an object is important to 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.510
 polygons were different enough he didn't 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.640
 be able to bend like that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.670
 and the central field racer either drive out 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.370
 either bend the opposite yes here and bend 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.870
 can be anything and i say if u 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.160
 you have enough creative thoughts 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 do anything with it 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.540
 modifier very really cool 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.910
 when you can do something cool 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.130
 just here from this so button 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.170
 cutter back and here's our box 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.269
 great this is if the failed trial 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.940
 was now the surface of this as gizmo 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.910
 only not gizmo lattice here we are 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.049
 moved here and now try what 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.049
 him to do with control points 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.740
 nothing happens to an object here 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.720
 there is a tick here. 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.990
 what is it called the check point 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.630
 man do not remember that only in we will 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.480
 it means to deform only what 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.520
 is in our lattice these here also 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.480
 you are from the inside of a point but not infrequently 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.270
 help here if we switch to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.640
 al'vir thesis means it will be all 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.840
 the top of which was used the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.330
 modifier but sometimes very uncomfortable 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.650
 I will get used as a matter of fact in most cases 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:47.760
 you will do without rearranging lattice 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.760
 let's go back to the place that's all yours 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.870
 mean if you are not happy with the grille 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.590
 but you want to not just roll there or 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.610
 scale or just move 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.750
 somewhere you can change its shape in 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.530
 mode created that is you are completely 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.900
 change your joke but on the object it is not 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.209
 affects then you switch for example 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.780
 contract lines and now you can 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:23.260
 change the object as before but only with 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:25.480
 the current position of these nodes here in 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.900
 general rot and have fun and now 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.430
 display of this this is if not worth it 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.080
 then do not show the lattice itself on the very 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.540
 In most cases it is not convenient 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.970
 allowed only you will interfere but without 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.440
 not very difficult to navigate that is 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.980
 These state as consider if this tick 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.110
 worth 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.750
 then you will not see what you got 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.590
 you only see this but if you 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.450
 move one vertex change will be 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.300
 she is somewhere here 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.050
 but you will not be shown later 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.380
 for example you come again to change it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.310
 yes here it is not allocated to us 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.010
 do the same you do and you can continue 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.560
 edit essentially this in most 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.080
 cases is not convenient in practice I have this 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.940
 I did not use the thing 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.240
 such a modifier is rarely used very 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.180
 rarely, well, in general, that's all I'm 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.580
 I wanted to tell you animation confront here 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.770
 ears tick let's not 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.270
 consider the most important thing if you are 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.090
 see to find out what it is all the same 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.430
 then you can see on the internet and then 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.940
 somehow tell you thanks for watching 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.940
 and see you
