 hi friends here is n we are in a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.139
 new episode of minecraft this time they 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.120
 I'm going to teach a new seed that is 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.370
 the stronghold 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 and let's see how he is about to create new 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.670
 world 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.890
 let's put him 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.660
 survival survivors 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:46.030
 ok I do not know if the seed has to be 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.520
 well with capital s at the beginning and what 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.300
 other has to be tiny is the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:59.970
 word is stronghold str 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 ong strong hold h l from there is so that 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.170
 you see it well all I will not let them 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 in the description 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.710
 good way I'm going to put creative to 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.990
 show them well 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.340
 ok not today let me know that you will not see 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.789
 achievements but I already have them 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.549
 these seeds is characterized by then 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.200
 as I was saying is a seed of 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.450
 good hardcore survival not so 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.990
 hardcore because if there are two or three 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.119
 islands but they are medium size not 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.630
 They are so neither so big nor so small 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.880
 but there are many hidden mines under the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.120
 water basically everyone is 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.930
 down the water right now they are going to see 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.810
 there too 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.180
 as it is said then if the bookstores 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.410
 hidden that are on the whole map that is 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.230
 what brought us the new update 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.790
 182 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.790
 let's wait for it to load 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.580
 let's appear near one of a lake 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 of lava or that is already the world leave 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.350
 I put the map 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120
 today 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.210
 or this one 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.539
 well basically this would be the island in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.549
 where would you live would you be 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.000
 where the survivors would be made 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.599
 here is the lava lake that told you 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.599
 let's see the island 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.970
 has many many mines connected 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.430
 under the water right now we are going to look 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.300
 some 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.460
 the map is this 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.420
 this would be the little island where 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.730
 you would make it as survivors 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 Check all the items you have 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.450
 all the resources for them to go 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.730
 watching has the aba as I showed you 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.900
 Well there are several animals there are not so many 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.329
 resources 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.670
 as they would be in the cactus and all that 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.280
 but it would be a matter of you 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.049
 survive and well now I'm going to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.630
 show something very interesting that brings 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.040
 this seed 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.840
 let's see here right below this 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.490
 I'm going to tell you where it is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.620
 now I'm going to teach you the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.690
 coordinates there is the map 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.530
 and it's down here where the map is 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.550
 there are the xyz coordinates 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.220
 we have a hidden library of which 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.819
 bring the new update and good 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:31.610
 let's see how it is breaking breaks breaks 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.970
 ok, I got there, do not be here. 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.970
 a cobweb 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.060
 good 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.690
 good 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.550
 ok and well here is this library that 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.150
 he told them the hidden bookstore or how 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.640
 want to say around here there is a chest a 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.599
 hidden chest that brings some books 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.599
 sheets of paper that we will take and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.520
 ah look here has a few passages 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.940
 secrets let's see what wave that such 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.690
 I'm going to break all the cobwebs already 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.130
 that are very annoying stone then 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.710
 silvery good I think it 's the first time 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.730
 I see that I think that's why I get 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:20.230
 let's see what brings you now are you 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.410
 like a I do not know an abandoned place a 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.010
 jail I do not know how to say it 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.330
 let's see what's here 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.660
 it looks interesting since everything looks very 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.080
 juicy and abandoned and look at all this 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.710
 mine is connected to the mines 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.200
 who are 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.270
 Well, practically everything was below 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.300
 of water everyone would rather be 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.540
 under the water the mines the mines here 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.540
 is it so 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.770
 they are very big 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.560
 let's find another mine here 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.569
 and until there comes good I'm going to go up 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.700
 to show them something else that I wanted 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.270
 teach them 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.240
 I'm going to put the map has gone fast up 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.770
 the square sun 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.960
 ok I 'll see if I find a lake 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.819
 tranquilita that in which he told them that 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.199
 there were like two or three but 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.639
 it is mainly where I am 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.500
 now it's over there 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.340
 to the north 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.590
 although we are exploring the map by 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.650
 here we are going to look for match to be the 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.530
 another quote that would be a biome of how to 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.490
 snow this you can come here 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.520
 if they lack snow, I do not know, so here 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.750
 more biome 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.430
 look here are the coordinates 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.630
 another little thing that I wanted to show you was 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.720
 as I discovered mines around here 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.340
 let's search but not go super 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.040
 speed 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.620
 where are they where they are 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.520
 around here there is an islet so very very very 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.650
 little girl over here to see what 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.060
 I will be exploring 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.060
 we were for the title below 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.460
 and I think that's where I think it's there 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:19.789
 A) Yes 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.800
 It looks like a light because there is lava and it goes 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.629
 directly a 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.910
 a tunnel that goes straight to some mines 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:30.620
 I think it's here if over here 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.620
 look for it where to look for it is 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:41.150
 because it 's like one where 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.150
 like lava if I'm close it's over here 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.470
 to see let look well where 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.470
 to see not to be there 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.110
 Yes I think so 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.960
 Well, it's practically still here 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.780
 effectively forgive 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.300
 just that I've spent a little here 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:09.280
 there are the tracks 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.860
 today we are going to lower what is here is 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.349
 and then here we have the 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.110
 abandoned mines that come in the new 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:20.289
 update and stop flying again 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:26.309
 move on 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:26.309
 runs runs fly flies fast fast ok 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.949
 Well here I am in the abandoned mines 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.389
 I was telling you here there are several chests 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:35.669
 I will teach the coordinates more or 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.360
 less around here I'm not sure but for 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.580
 here where I am is 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.280
 there is a little ointment where is where there is more 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.009
 mines there diamond a lot lava there's a 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.340
 hidden chest had also discovered 

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:51.199
 several various mods generators but 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.550
 Well it would be a matter of you 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:58.930
 explore the map and it would be all and 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:01.310
 you have to inhabit the map and 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.770
 make it big survivors 

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.439
 survivors and then do not forget 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:09.139
 comment give like and subscribe for more 

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:11.710
 videos plus maps and then I say goodbye 

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.710
 goodbye
