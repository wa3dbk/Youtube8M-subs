what's going on guys I was on Twitter

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.480 
what's going on guys I was on Twitter
earlier<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.689> saw<00:00:03.929> JT<00:00:04.290> 2020<00:00:05.040> was<00:00:05.160> answering

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
earlier and I saw JT 2020 was answering

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.099 
earlier and I saw JT 2020 was answering
questions<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:05.879> black<00:00:06.240> ops<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.810> someone

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
questions about black ops and someone

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.660 
questions about black ops and someone
asked<00:00:07.440> him<00:00:07.529> will<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.830> still<00:00:08.130> be<00:00:08.189> able<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
asked him will I still be able to

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.450 
asked him will I still be able to
quickscope<00:00:09.090> he<00:00:09.809> said<00:00:10.080> no<00:00:10.469> quickscoping<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
quickscope he said no quickscoping as a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.549 
quickscope he said no quickscoping as a
cheap<00:00:11.759> way<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> play<00:00:12.300> we're<00:00:12.929> specifically

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
cheap way to play we're specifically

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.980 
cheap way to play we're specifically
going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.130> GIMP<00:00:14.370> quickscoping<00:00:15.089> sorry<00:00:15.540> plays

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
going to GIMP quickscoping sorry plays

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.340 
going to GIMP quickscoping sorry plays
straight<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.240> I<00:00:18.240> thought<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> logic<00:00:19.199> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
straight up and I thought the logic and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.779 
straight up and I thought the logic and
this<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.590> completely<00:00:19.710> wrong<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.490> decided

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
this was completely wrong so I decided

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.359 
this was completely wrong so I decided
to<00:00:20.939> address<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.570> video<00:00:22.130> my<00:00:23.130> first

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to address it in this video my first

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.640 
to address it in this video my first
question<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.789> JT<00:00:24.000> 2020<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> cheap

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
question to JT 2020 is how is it cheap

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.400 
question to JT 2020 is how is it cheap
I'm<00:00:26.550> assuming<00:00:27.119> JT<00:00:27.300> 2020<00:00:27.900> thinks<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.260> quick

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I'm assuming JT 2020 thinks that quick

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.080 
I'm assuming JT 2020 thinks that quick
scoping<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.830> cheap<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> power<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
scoping is cheap because of the power of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.700 
scoping is cheap because of the power of
the<00:00:30.119> sniper<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.810> kill<00:00:31.019> someone<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.560> one

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the sniper to kill someone with one

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.850 
the sniper to kill someone with one
bullet<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.579> quickly<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:34.020> explosives<00:00:34.469> can

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
bullet so quickly but explosives can

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
bullet so quickly but explosives can
kill<00:00:35.070> someone<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.670> even<00:00:36.059> multiple<00:00:36.390> people

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
kill someone or even multiple people

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
kill someone or even multiple people
just<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.170> quickly<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> sniper<00:00:37.920> except<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
just as quickly as a sniper except a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.510 
just as quickly as a sniper except a
sniper<00:00:39.270> sniper<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.379> requires<00:00:40.800> aim<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
sniper sniper actually requires aim and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
sniper sniper actually requires aim and
requires<00:00:42.300> way<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.750> aim<00:00:42.870> than<00:00:43.079> an<00:00:43.170> explosive

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
requires way more aim than an explosive

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
requires way more aim than an explosive
to<00:00:43.770> use<00:00:44.570> quick<00:00:45.570> scoping<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> less<00:00:46.200> cheap<00:00:46.530> tin

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to use quick scoping is less cheap tin

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190 
to use quick scoping is less cheap tin
explosives<00:00:47.420> because<00:00:48.420> explosives<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
explosives because explosives have a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.930 
explosives because explosives have a
large<00:00:49.469> blast<00:00:49.739> radius<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.579> even<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.820> used

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
large blast radius and can even be used

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
large blast radius and can even be used
to<00:00:51.210> kill<00:00:51.360> multiple<00:00:51.809> enemies<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> even

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to kill multiple enemies and even

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.290 
to kill multiple enemies and even
enemies<00:00:53.219> around<00:00:53.610> corners<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.270> sniper<00:00:55.170> rifle

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
enemies around corners a sniper rifle

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
enemies around corners a sniper rifle
usually<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.480> requires<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.230> direct<00:00:58.680> line<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
usually just requires a direct line of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
usually just requires a direct line of
sight<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.820> target<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> crosshairs

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
sight to the target and the crosshairs

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
sight to the target and the crosshairs
have<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.230> perfectly<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.100> target<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
have to be perfectly on that target to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.130 
have to be perfectly on that target to
kill<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.090> which<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.510> even<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.750> difficult

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
kill them which is even more difficult

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.420 
kill them which is even more difficult
when<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.650> factor<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.460> stuff<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.760> lag<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.430> my

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
when you factor in stuff like lag and my

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.100 
when you factor in stuff like lag and my
second<00:01:08.790> point<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.689> point<00:01:09.900> was

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
second point well the first point was

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
second point well the first point was
pretty<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.619> summed<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.630> explosives<00:01:12.630> are

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pretty much summed up is explosives are

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
pretty much summed up is explosives are
way<00:01:13.200> cheaper<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> put<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
way cheaper if you want to put it that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.870 
way cheaper if you want to put it that
way<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.479> snipers<00:01:16.250> especially<00:01:17.250> quickscoping

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
way then snipers especially quickscoping

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.200 
way then snipers especially quickscoping
which<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> harder<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.869> actual<00:01:19.439> sniping<00:01:20.400> but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
which is harder than actual sniping but

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.200 
which is harder than actual sniping but
a<00:01:21.240> second<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.680> second<00:01:23.070> topic<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.580> ask<00:01:23.939> any

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
a second my second topic was ask any

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
a second my second topic was ask any
person<00:01:24.390> who<00:01:24.659> loves<00:01:24.869> quickscoping<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
person who loves quickscoping and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
person who loves quickscoping and
whether<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.340> easier<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.850> harder<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.270> get

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
whether it's easier or harder to get

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.020 
whether it's easier or harder to get
kills<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:27.930> even<00:01:28.140> win<00:01:28.320> games<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.920> every<00:01:29.850> single

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
kills or even win games and every single

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
kills or even win games and every single
one<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:30.780> tell<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.470> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
one of them will tell you that they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
one of them will tell you that they
could<00:01:31.890> perform<00:01:32.250> better<00:01:32.430> using<00:01:32.790> an<00:01:32.880> automatic

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
could perform better using an automatic

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
could perform better using an automatic
weapon<00:01:33.860> quickscoping<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.549> itself

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
much is I'm not arguing that gimping

quickscoping<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.079> wrong<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.620> think

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
quickscoping is wrong I actually think

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.430 
quickscoping is wrong I actually think
that<00:02:59.069> quick<00:02:59.370> scoping<00:02:59.760> is<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.299> little<00:03:00.989> too<00:03:01.230> easy

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that quick scoping is a little too easy
