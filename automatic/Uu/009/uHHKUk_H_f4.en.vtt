00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that's pretty much it so let's go ahead

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.789 
that's pretty much it so let's go ahead
and<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> gameplay<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.560> I'll<00:01:25.680> give

and get into the gameplay and I'll give
you<00:01:25.860> guys<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.009> first<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> plays

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you guys a first look at how it plays

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:44.600 
you guys a first look at how it plays
and<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.460> guys<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> differences

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.070 

all<00:01:45.610> right<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:45.940> been<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.120> while<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.690> let's<00:01:46.720> see

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
all right it's been a while so let's see

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.950 
all right it's been a while so let's see
how<00:01:47.260> could<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.560> do<00:01:47.620> here<00:01:48.600> hopefully<00:01:49.600> this<00:01:49.750> game

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
how could I do here hopefully this game

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.100 
how could I do here hopefully this game
is<00:01:50.110> much<00:01:51.010> different<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.880> terms<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.240> moves<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:53.050> I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
is much different in terms of moves so I

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.910 
is much different in terms of moves so I
can<00:01:53.290> remember<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.650> couple<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.040> things<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:56.770> on

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
can remember a couple of things I'm on

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.070 
can remember a couple of things I'm on
beginner<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.670> that's<00:01:58.210> good

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.240 

play<00:02:02.080> like<00:02:02.260> this<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.680> don't<00:02:02.830> know<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.040> any<00:02:03.160> of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
play like this I don't know if any of

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.980 
play like this I don't know if any of

anyway I'm played this game in a while
as<00:03:39.740> I<00:03:39.890> said<00:03:40.190> but<00:03:40.520> compared<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.270> old<00:03:41.420> one

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
as I said but compared to the old one

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.790 
as I said but compared to the old one
that's<00:03:41.810> all<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.960> really<00:03:42.110> have<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.470> compare<00:03:42.770> it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
that's all I really have to compare it

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:51.160 
that's all I really have to compare it
to<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:43.250> pretty<00:03:43.490> awesome<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.030> like<00:03:49.960> this<00:03:50.960> one

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
to it's pretty awesome I like this one

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.840 
to it's pretty awesome I like this one
should<00:03:51.380> kill<00:03:51.710> someone<00:03:52.130> imagining<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.730> with

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
should kill someone imagining it with

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.710 
should kill someone imagining it with
that<00:03:52.970> kind<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.300> loot

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
that kind of loot

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:02.470 
that kind of loot
it's<00:03:54.200> like<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.380> sponge<00:04:01.000> used<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.120> have<00:04:02.240> a<00:04:02.300> move

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
it's like a sponge used to have a move

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.350 
it's like a sponge used to have a move
where<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.750> can<00:04:02.960> spit<00:04:03.350> stuff<00:04:04.180> seems<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.240> be

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
where you can spit stuff seems to be

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.550 
where you can spit stuff seems to be
spinning

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.170 

you<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:12.709> fly<00:04:12.950> yes<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:16.549> moves<00:04:16.790> are<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> lot<00:04:17.150> more

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
you can fly yes the moves are a lot more

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.270 
you can fly yes the moves are a lot more
like<00:04:17.870> different<00:04:18.500> like<00:04:18.590> their<00:04:18.739> technical<00:04:19.250> a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
like different like their technical a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.190 
like different like their technical a
little<00:04:19.430> bit<00:04:19.549> more<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.180> each<00:04:20.329> move<00:04:20.660> we're<00:04:21.079> in

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
little bit more so in each move we're in

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.310 
little bit more so in each move we're in
the<00:04:21.290> old<00:04:21.440> Tekken<00:04:21.919> Tag<00:04:22.880> Tournament<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.750> move

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
the old Tekken Tag Tournament the move

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.050 
the old Tekken Tag Tournament the move
would<00:04:24.500> just<00:04:24.650> be<00:04:24.770> basic<00:04:25.220> like<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.400> flying<00:04:25.850> I

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
would just be basic like this flying I

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.909 
would just be basic like this flying I
noticed<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.510> already<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:27.290> feel<00:04:27.380> like<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.800> can

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
noticed it already I feel like you can

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.440 
noticed it already I feel like you can
do<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.040> couple<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.460> things<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.820> are<00:04:29.030> different

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
do a couple of things that are different

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.650 
do a couple of things that are different
in<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.960> air<00:04:30.139> just<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.530> terms<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:34.660> this

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
in the air just in terms of that this

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.080 
in the air just in terms of that this
officer

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
officer

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.210 
officer
so<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.750> Tekken<00:04:39.260> Tag<00:04:39.380> Tournament<00:04:39.440> 2<00:04:39.860> the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
so that is Tekken Tag Tournament 2 the

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.200 
so that is Tekken Tag Tournament 2 the
gameplay<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.639> pretty<00:04:40.730> sweet

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
gameplay is pretty sweet

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.090 
gameplay is pretty sweet
I<00:04:41.390> like<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:42.740> my<00:04:42.890> first

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
I like it and this is just my first

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.590 
I like it and this is just my first
match<00:04:43.310> here<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:43.790> there's<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.090> lot<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.300> go

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
match here so there's a lot to go

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.320 
match here so there's a lot to go
something<00:04:45.200> with<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.470> promotional<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.940> don't

something with that promotional I don't

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.550 
something with that promotional I don't
know<00:04:47.390> what<00:04:47.510> that<00:04:47.660> was<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.230> that's<00:04:48.410> pretty

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
know what that was but that's pretty

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.950 
know what that was but that's pretty
interesting<00:04:48.910> but<00:04:49.910> if<00:04:50.180> you're<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.360> tech<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.660> fan

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
interesting but if you're a tech and fan

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.110 
interesting but if you're a tech and fan
definitely<00:04:51.530> this<00:04:51.800> game<00:04:52.010> seems<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.790> lot<00:04:52.940> like

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
the Tekken that we know it seems a lot

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.280 
the Tekken that we know it seems a lot
like<00:04:55.610> Tekken<00:04:56.000> 6<00:04:56.240> in<00:04:56.600> terms<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:56.990> game<00:04:57.140> a

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290
