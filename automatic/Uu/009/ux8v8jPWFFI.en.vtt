00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.930
 first designers to reach the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.240
 old Palermo circuit just in 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.430
 dotcom fashion blogs what I do 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.019
 basically is to have a follow-up in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 certain themes of what is fashionable 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.420
 Argentina and one of the points that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.870
 I started how to play was the theme of the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.040
 circuit of the river or the route of 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.129
 designers who work with wool to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 make designs and take out the rustic part 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.969
 what do they have if what is work 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.590
 craft of wool to put a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 little design to put a little bit of 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.960

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.340
 your garments good mainly an item 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.350
 that I have very much in mind when 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 select the material is it to be 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.030
 nice to the skin the air is 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.190
 obviously 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.650
 appropriate cushion on the skin for 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.200
 that the person feels comfortable and does not 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.640
 pique do not paint him and good and something else 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.229
 that we support a lot is also the aroma 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.759
 that we put in the garments with which 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.869
 It also makes good people 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:23.950
 you put it perfumed and they are good has the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.899
 characteristic smell of the good brand 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.020
 The materials you select are something 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.729
 hours die rabbit hairs good and 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 some of Castile also carry 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.190
 mixes with the product to make it a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.600
 Delicate fine product and lasting 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.700
 season after season that's why 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.220
 we work to confront offspring of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.500
 where is the one 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.570
 this is a monkey for example that is 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.039
 all developed in semi machines 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.470
 industrial but has all the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.030
 handmade details and we also have 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.150
 all the belts developed by the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.520
 try out 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.160
 has a laborious job because it is a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.100
 very fine side as you can appreciate without 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.290
 even a hawkeye - in every human as 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.900
 brings the design and that's obviously why 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.210
 both ancestral linguistic technique and 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.820
 well we make a good team and we have 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.090
 a product that we have great value 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.310
 added in recent years several 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.500
 designers have proposed as trend 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.110
 beyond crochet also other types 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 of fabrics and I think obviously that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 sum because obviously the Argentina 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.940
 I followed a lot with the trends but 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.160

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.250
