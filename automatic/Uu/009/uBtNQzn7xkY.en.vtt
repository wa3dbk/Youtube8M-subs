00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.990 
sword and he looks good to go and he
looks<00:03:39.739> back<00:03:39.919> at<00:03:40.099> doflamingo<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.790> doflamingo

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
looks back at doflamingo and doflamingo

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.159 
looks back at doflamingo and doflamingo
does<00:03:41.510> not<00:03:42.139> look<00:03:42.380> good<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.950> go<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.370> mean<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.419> the

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
does not look good to go I mean just the

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.440 
does not look good to go I mean just the
difference<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.859> in<00:03:46.310> their<00:03:46.849> strength<00:03:47.180> at<00:03:47.299> this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
difference in in their strength at this

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.140 
difference in in their strength at this
point<00:03:47.720> or<00:03:47.959> rather<00:03:48.109> their<00:03:48.349> condition<00:03:49.150> it's

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
point or rather their condition it's

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.770 
point or rather their condition it's
apparent<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:50.900> I'm<00:03:51.109> really<00:03:51.680> really<00:03:52.250> excited

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
apparent so I'm really really excited

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.089 
apparent so I'm really really excited
but<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.840> mean<00:03:54.079> at<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.319> very<00:03:54.349> least<00:03:54.650> birdcage

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
but I mean at the very least birdcage

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.009 
but I mean at the very least birdcage
can't<00:03:55.489> last<00:03:55.669> more<00:03:55.910> than<00:03:56.060> another<00:03:56.150> another

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
can't last more than another another

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.720 
can't last more than another another
chapter<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.620> think<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.370> thing<00:03:58.639> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
chapter I think that it's a thing the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.670 
chapter I think that it's a thing the
next<00:03:58.940> chapter<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.389> birdcage<00:03:59.629> is<00:03:59.959> done<00:04:00.200> at

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680
