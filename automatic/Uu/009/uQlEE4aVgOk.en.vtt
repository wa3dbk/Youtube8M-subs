extended<00:00:35.840> down<00:00:36.020> maybe<00:00:36.980> another<00:00:37.250> foot<00:00:37.580> or<00:00:37.610> so

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
extended down maybe another foot or so

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.360

below<00:00:38.000> what<00:00:38.240> you<00:00:38.360> see<00:00:38.510> there<00:00:38.750> it's<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.920> jaws

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
below what you see there it's a the jaws

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.360 
below what you see there it's a the jaws
of<00:00:40.400> four<00:00:41.050> axis<00:00:42.050> jaw<00:00:42.470> so<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:42.740> has<00:00:42.860> up<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.220> down

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
of four axis jaw so it has up and down

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.120 
of four axis jaw so it has up and down
movement<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.000> side<00:00:44.240> to<00:00:44.480> side<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:45.739> reasoning

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
movement and side to side the reasoning

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.740 
movement and side to side the reasoning
behind<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:46.520> with<00:00:46.760> stand<00:00:47.030> one<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.480> brac

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
behind that with stand one of the brac

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.500 
behind that with stand one of the brac
to<00:00:47.960> appear<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.500> be<00:00:48.560> as<00:00:48.770> docile<00:00:49.070> as<00:00:50.020> possible<00:00:51.020> so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
to appear to be as docile as possible so

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.150 
to appear to be as docile as possible so
one<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.720> things<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.260> four<00:00:54.560> axis<00:00:54.950> jaw

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
one of the things that a four axis jaw

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.860 
one of the things that a four axis jaw
gives<00:00:55.490> you<00:00:55.580> is<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.760> sort<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.240> orbital

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
gives you is that sort of orbital

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.470 
gives you is that sort of orbital
movement<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.560> lower<00:00:57.740> jaw<00:00:58.150> grinding<00:00:59.150> side

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
movement of the lower jaw grinding side

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.180 
movement of the lower jaw grinding side
to<00:00:59.690> side<00:00:59.870> which<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.320> reminiscent<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:00.950> cow

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
to side which is reminiscent of a cow

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.580 
to side which is reminiscent of a cow
chewing<00:01:01.850> its<00:01:02.120> cud<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:03.260> thought<00:01:03.440> well<00:01:03.560> that

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
chewing its cud we thought well that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.730 
chewing its cud we thought well that
certainly<00:01:04.010> can't<00:01:04.220> be<00:01:04.369> bad<00:01:05.020> so<00:01:06.020> here's<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.350> a

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
certainly can't be bad so here's a a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.090 
certainly can't be bad so here's a a
little<00:01:07.280> further<00:01:07.520> test<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.150> can<00:01:08.299> see<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.100> grab

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
little further test you can see the grab

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.679 
little further test you can see the grab
some<00:01:10.400> vines<00:01:10.430> from<00:01:10.939> out<00:01:11.119> on<00:01:11.150> front<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
some vines from out on front of the

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.780 
some vines from out on front of the
building<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.310> put<00:01:13.310> them<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.549> Bragg's

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
building and put them in the Bragg's

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.450 
building and put them in the Bragg's
mouth<00:01:14.170> at<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:15.350> point<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.799> tongue<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.310> moving

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
mouth at this point the tongue is moving

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.709 
mouth at this point the tongue is moving
also<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.340> lips<00:01:19.579> are<00:01:19.820> moving<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
also and the the lips are moving a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.330 
also and the the lips are moving a
little<00:01:20.869> too<00:01:20.960> much<00:01:21.289> but<00:01:21.619> that's<00:01:22.039> something

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
little too much but that's something

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.389 
little too much but that's something
that<00:01:22.429> you<00:01:22.719> learn<00:01:23.719> as<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.109> go<00:01:24.289> so<00:01:25.159> it's<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
that you learn as you go so it's a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.580 
that you learn as you go so it's a
matter<00:01:25.579> of<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:26.090> number<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.229> people

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
matter of a number of people

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.349 
matter of a number of people
coordinating<00:01:28.249> I<00:01:28.340> think<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:28.820> were<00:01:28.939> six<00:01:29.240> of

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
coordinating I think there were six of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.059 
coordinating I think there were six of
us<00:01:29.479> all<00:01:29.689> together<00:01:29.840> puppeteering<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.859> brac

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
us all together puppeteering on the brac

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.279 
us all together puppeteering on the brac
there<00:01:31.310> was<00:01:31.429> someone<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.880> eyes<00:01:32.200> someone<00:01:33.200> on

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
there was someone on the eyes someone on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.429 
there was someone on the eyes someone on
the<00:01:33.380> tongue<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.920> was<00:01:34.189> on<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.520> jaw<00:01:34.729> movement

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
the tongue I was on the jaw movement

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.469 
the tongue I was on the jaw movement
there's<00:01:36.439> someone<00:01:36.679> on<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.829> lips<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:37.429> then<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
there's someone on the lips and then the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.309 
there's someone on the lips and then the
big<00:01:38.869> move<00:01:39.319> was<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:40.299> neck<00:01:41.299> movement<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:42.289> was

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
big move was the neck movement there was

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.989 
big move was the neck movement there was
head<00:01:42.979> movement<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:43.549> then<00:01:43.700> there<00:01:43.819> was<00:01:43.880> also

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
head movement but then there was also

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.550 
head movement but then there was also
neck<00:01:44.389> room<00:01:44.569> where<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.899> whole<00:01:45.049> thing<00:01:45.350> could

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
neck room where the whole thing could

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.529 
neck room where the whole thing could
pitch<00:01:45.710> forward<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.219> back<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.639> the<00:01:47.389> whole

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
pitch forward and back and the whole

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.120 
pitch forward and back and the whole
thing<00:01:47.749> was<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.439> largest<00:01:48.679> pepper<00:01:48.950> we

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
thing was it was the largest pepper we

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.980 
thing was it was the largest pepper we
built<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.429> had<00:01:49.579> absolutely<00:01:50.030> no<00:01:50.329> hydraulics

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
built that had absolutely no hydraulics

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
built that had absolutely no hydraulics
in<00:01:51.139> it<00:01:51.789> so<00:01:52.789> it<00:01:52.909> was<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:54.350> was<00:01:54.409> weighty<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.549> big

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
in it so it was it was weighty and a big

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.370 
in it so it was it was weighty and a big
challenge<00:01:55.969> to<00:01:56.270> get<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.630> move<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.960> got<00:01:57.109> quite<00:01:57.350> a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
challenge to get to move I got quite a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.349 
challenge to get to move I got quite a
workout<00:01:57.710> on<00:01:57.859> the<00:01:57.979> jaw<00:01:58.189> doing<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.850> big<00:01:59.060> sort<00:01:59.299> of

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
workout on the jaw doing a big sort of

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.999
