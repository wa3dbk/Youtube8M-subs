00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
from the anastomosis Dendrobium that I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.150 
from the anastomosis Dendrobium that I
had<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.150> reported<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.619> guys<00:00:19.920> were

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
roots were dead it was just clinging to
the<00:00:44.010> mother<00:00:44.190> plant<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.059> broke<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the mother plant and I broke it and I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
the mother plant and I broke it and I
was<00:00:45.930> wondering<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.309> now

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
was wondering what to do with them now

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.240 
was wondering what to do with them now
it<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.510> had<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.710> two<00:00:49.739> roots

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
it actually had about one or two roots

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
it actually had about one or two roots
which<00:00:50.550> were<00:00:50.820> half<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> centimeter<00:00:51.840> long<00:00:51.980> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
which were half a centimeter long so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.040 
which were half a centimeter long so
what<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.129> decided<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.449> put<00:00:54.809> some

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
what I decided to do is put some

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.770 
what I decided to do is put some
sphagnum<00:00:55.350> Moss<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.670> cup<00:00:56.969> it's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
sphagnum Moss in this little cup it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.160 
sphagnum Moss in this little cup it's
just<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.289> tiny<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.570> stick<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> here

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
just so tiny and stick them in here

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.280 
just so tiny and stick them in here
just<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.579> been<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:03.290> three

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
just like that and it's been about three

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
just like that and it's been about three

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
weeks I would say since I did this and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
weeks I would say since I did this and

they used to look I didn't film it back
then<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.060> imagine<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.420> had<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
then but imagine they only had this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
then but imagine they only had this
little<00:01:16.979> leaf<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.820> another<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> that's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
little leaf and another one and that's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
little leaf and another one and that's
it<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.729> were<00:01:20.790> looking<00:01:21.330> really

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it and do it they were looking really

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.999 
it and do it they were looking really
sad<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.540> what<00:01:24.540> I've<00:01:24.720> learned<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.590> with

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
sad so what I've learned is that with

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.179 
sad so what I've learned is that with
small<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.640> orchids<00:01:27.710> these<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:29.070> be

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
small little orchids these can be

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
small little orchids these can be
considered<00:01:29.400> seedlings<00:01:30.119> they're<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.570> they're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
considered seedlings they're not they're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
considered seedlings they're not they're
just<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.409> offshoots<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.610> they're<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
just some offshoots but they're just so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
just some offshoots but they're just so
tiny<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.900> developed<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.770> such<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> tiny<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
tiny and developed in on such a tiny and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.649 
tiny and developed in on such a tiny and
sad<00:01:36.509> looking<00:01:36.869> cane<00:01:37.250> if<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> keep

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
sad looking cane if if you want to keep

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
sad looking cane if if you want to keep
them<00:01:39.840> alive<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.500> best<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> put<00:01:41.400> them<00:01:41.610> in

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
them alive it's best to put them in

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.609 
them alive it's best to put them in
sphagnum<00:01:42.270> Moss<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.049> pretty<00:01:43.350> logical

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
sphagnum Moss and it's pretty logical

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
sphagnum Moss and it's pretty logical
although<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.850> draw<00:01:45.060> beings<00:01:45.360> don't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
although then draw beings don't

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
although then draw beings don't
necessarily<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.439> sphagnum<00:01:46.920> Moss<00:01:47.340> they

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
necessarily like sphagnum Moss they

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
necessarily like sphagnum Moss they
would<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.790> much<00:01:47.909> better<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:49.290> well

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
would do much better now very well

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.370 
would do much better now very well
ventilated<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.579> we'll<00:01:50.790> draining<00:01:51.270> mix<00:01:51.509> these

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
ventilated and we'll draining mix these

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069 
ventilated and we'll draining mix these
guys<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:54.119> necessarily<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.630> any

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
guys they don't necessarily have any

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
guys they don't necessarily have any
roots<00:01:55.409> any<00:01:55.770> other<00:01:56.040> backbones<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> feed

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
roots any other backbones they can feed

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.800 
roots any other backbones they can feed
from<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.710> need<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.219> constant<00:02:00.180> source<00:02:00.540> of
