effects<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.739> waterfall<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.489> you<00:00:45.550> ask

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
effects of a waterfall and you ask

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.270 
effects of a waterfall and you ask
yourself<00:00:46.660> how<00:00:46.870> did<00:00:46.930> they<00:00:47.230> do<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.739> neutral

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
yourself how did they do it a neutral

density<00:00:48.580> filter<00:00:49.330> is<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:50.050> answer<00:00:50.410> basically

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
density filter is the answer basically

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.580 
density filter is the answer basically
what<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.640> is<00:00:51.670> it's<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.300> piece<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.629> dark<00:00:52.840> glass<00:00:53.290> in

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
what it is it's a piece of dark glass in

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.470 
what it is it's a piece of dark glass in
front<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.950> your<00:00:54.070> camera<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:55.030> will<00:00:55.240> limit

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
front of your camera and that will limit

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.390 
front of your camera and that will limit
the<00:00:55.810> amount<00:00:56.020> of<00:00:56.230> light<00:00:56.440> getting<00:00:56.710> into<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.190> and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
the amount of light getting into it and

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.580 
the amount of light getting into it and
that<00:00:58.000> will<00:00:58.180> allow<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.570> use<00:00:58.870> long<00:00:59.350> shutter

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
that will allow you to use long shutter

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.999 
that will allow you to use long shutter

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
the right way to do it so you don't need

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.090 
the right way to do it so you don't need
to<00:01:57.580> depend<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:58.179> any<00:01:58.330> software's<00:01:58.899> use<00:01:59.500> this<00:01:59.770> and

with<00:02:23.110> an<00:02:23.319> adapter<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> filters<00:02:25.060> I'm

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
with an adapter for for the filters I'm

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.449 
with an adapter for for the filters I'm
gonna<00:02:25.629> show<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.930> how<00:02:26.319> easy<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.950> install

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
gonna show you how easy is to install

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.589 
gonna show you how easy is to install
one<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:27.940> going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.180> show<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> few

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
one and I'm going to show you a few

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.660 
one and I'm going to show you a few
examples<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.319> basically<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.160> need<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.489> do

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
examples so basically what I need to do

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.869 
examples so basically what I need to do
is<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.180> install<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.980> adapter<00:02:32.980> ring<00:02:33.160> on<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
is to install a adapter ring on the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.880 
is to install a adapter ring on the
camera<00:02:34.239> on<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.780> lens<00:02:34.959> obviously<00:02:35.590> my

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
camera on the lens obviously my

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.770 
camera on the lens obviously my
recommendation<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.879> want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> go<00:02:37.209> for<00:02:37.450> one

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
recommendation if you want to go for one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.380 
recommendation if you want to go for one
of<00:02:37.930> these<00:02:38.110> ND<00:02:38.560> filters<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.640> should<00:02:39.849> get<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> set

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
of these ND filters you should get a set

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.150 
of these ND filters you should get a set
because<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:41.170> actually<00:02:41.440> combine<00:02:41.680> these

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
because you can actually combine these

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.300 
because you can actually combine these
filters<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.440> only<00:02:44.440> one<00:02:44.620> filter<00:02:44.860> will<00:02:45.129> not

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
filters so if only one filter will not

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.089 
filters so if only one filter will not
be<00:02:45.489> enough<00:02:45.819> for<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.870> use<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.470> longer

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
be enough for you to use a longer

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.460 
be enough for you to use a longer
exposure<00:02:48.370> than<00:02:48.819> two<00:02:49.000> seconds<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.629> just<00:02:50.079> mounted

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
exposure than two seconds I just mounted

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.339 
exposure than two seconds I just mounted
the<00:02:50.650> adapter<00:02:51.220> ring<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.150> lens<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.629> this

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
the adapter ring on the lens and this

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.220 
the adapter ring on the lens and this
one<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.799> just<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> adapter<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.480> those<00:02:55.810> square

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
one is just the adapter for those square

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.580 
one is just the adapter for those square
filters<00:02:59.230> and<00:03:00.269> basically<00:03:01.269> as<00:03:01.629> simple<00:03:02.200> as<00:03:02.319> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
filters and basically as simple as that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.770 
filters and basically as simple as that
we<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:03.040> stick<00:03:03.250> one<00:03:03.609> we<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.180> slide<00:03:04.420> one

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
we just stick one we just slide one

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.800 
we just stick one we just slide one
filter<00:03:05.109> in<00:03:05.640> after<00:03:06.640> my<00:03:06.760> trip<00:03:07.000> today<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.299> realize

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
filter in after my trip today I realize

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.780 
filter in after my trip today I realize
that<00:03:07.989> only<00:03:08.170> one<00:03:08.440> filter<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.859> not<00:03:09.069> enough<00:03:09.400> so

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that only one filter is not enough so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.020 
that only one filter is not enough so
this<00:03:10.090> has<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:11.190> ability<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.220> use<00:03:12.549> actually

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
this has the ability to use actually

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.330 
this has the ability to use actually
three<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:14.019> combine<00:03:14.290> them<00:03:14.709> as<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.160> can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
three so you can combine them as you can

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.220 
three so you can combine them as you can
see<00:03:15.549> fit<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> in<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.209> case<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.900> three

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
see fit so in this case I have three

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.990 
see fit so in this case I have three
different<00:03:20.440> filters<00:03:21.010> with<00:03:21.220> three<00:03:21.609> different

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
different filters with three different

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.349 
different filters with three different
values<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.720> two<00:03:23.230> ND<00:03:24.040> filter<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.700> four<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
values I have a two ND filter a four and

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.610 
values I have a two ND filter a four and
eight<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:26.290> means<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:27.180> 14<00:03:28.180> stops<00:03:28.810> filter<00:03:29.319> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
eight that means a 14 stops filter that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.879 
eight that means a 14 stops filter that
means<00:03:29.889> my<00:03:30.190> exposure<00:03:30.849> is<00:03:31.299> decreased<00:03:31.959> with<00:03:32.230> 14

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
means my exposure is decreased with 14

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.009 
means my exposure is decreased with 14
stops<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.849> will<00:03:34.030> give<00:03:34.239> me<00:03:34.419> plenty<00:03:34.780> of

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
stops that will give me plenty of

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.440 
stops that will give me plenty of
opportunity<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:36.220> increase<00:03:36.669> my<00:03:37.000> shutter<00:03:37.359> speed

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
opportunity to increase my shutter speed

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.009 
opportunity to increase my shutter speed
I<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.769> taken<00:03:39.069> today<00:03:39.459> few<00:03:40.000> shots<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.810> can

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
I have taken today few shots and I can

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.659 
I have taken today few shots and I can
tell<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.470> best<00:03:41.680> way<00:03:41.919> to<00:03:41.950> deal<00:03:42.340> with<00:03:42.519> it

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
tell you the best way to deal with it

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.430 
tell you the best way to deal with it
you<00:03:43.000> have<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.419> do<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.599> in<00:03:43.750> manual<00:03:44.139> with<00:03:44.319> the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
you have to do it in manual with the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.740 
you have to do it in manual with the
aperture<00:03:44.769> at<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.310> minimum<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.940> what<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.329> shot

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
aperture at the minimum so what I shot

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.589 
aperture at the minimum so what I shot
was<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.319> aperture<00:03:47.739> 22<00:03:48.370> my<00:03:49.120> lens<00:03:49.419> is

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
was the aperture 22 my lens is

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.009 
was the aperture 22 my lens is
submitting<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.139> aperture<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.620> 22<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:52.019> even

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
submitting the aperture to 22 and even

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.009 
submitting the aperture to 22 and even
in<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.590> case<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:54.099> found<00:03:54.730> very<00:03:55.359> bright

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
in this case I found very bright

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.500 
in this case I found very bright
situations<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.919> would<00:03:57.549> not<00:03:57.730> allow<00:03:58.030> me<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.359> go

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
situations that would not allow me to go

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.140 
situations that would not allow me to go
about<00:03:58.930> four<00:03:59.260> seconds<00:03:59.709> and<00:03:59.889> what<00:04:00.849> I've<00:04:01.000> done

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
about four seconds and what I've done

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.970 
about four seconds and what I've done
was<00:04:01.450> actually<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:02.019> for<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.440> lowest<00:04:02.799> ISO

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
was actually going for the lowest ISO

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.180 
was actually going for the lowest ISO
the<00:04:03.910> lowest<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.329> saw<00:04:04.599> on<00:04:04.780> my<00:04:04.959> camera<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.440> 100<00:04:05.980> but

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
the lowest I saw on my camera is 100 but

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.339 
the lowest I saw on my camera is 100 but
it<00:04:06.400> does<00:04:06.609> have<00:04:06.910> an<00:04:07.090> opportunity<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.780> extend<00:04:08.079> it

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
it does have an opportunity to extend it

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.819 
it does have an opportunity to extend it
to<00:04:08.530> even<00:04:08.829> lower<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.239> ISO<00:04:10.780> was<00:04:10.989> actually<00:04:11.410> 50

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
to even lower so the ISO was actually 50

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.849 
to even lower so the ISO was actually 50
f-stop<00:04:12.549> was<00:04:12.819> 22<00:04:13.449> and<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.109> shutter<00:04:14.349> speed<00:04:14.500> was

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
f-stop was 22 and the shutter speed was

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.250 
f-stop was 22 and the shutter speed was
four<00:04:15.160> seconds<00:04:15.669> depending<00:04:16.449> how<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.660> use<00:04:16.989> these

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
four seconds depending how I use these

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.930 
four seconds depending how I use these
the<00:04:17.560> shutter<00:04:17.769> speed<00:04:17.859> varies<00:04:18.340> between<00:04:18.489> four

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the shutter speed varies between four

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.969 
the shutter speed varies between four
four<00:04:19.329> seconds<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:19.870> eight<00:04:20.049> seconds<00:04:20.530> probably

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
four seconds and eight seconds probably
