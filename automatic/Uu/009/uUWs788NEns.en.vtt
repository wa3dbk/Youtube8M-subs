00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.120 

well<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.800> my<00:00:02.010> floppy<00:00:02.429> drive<00:00:02.879> motor<00:00:04.130> took

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
well this is my floppy drive motor took

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.339 
well this is my floppy drive motor took
me<00:00:05.279> almost<00:00:05.460> forever<00:00:05.960> trying<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.140> find<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:09.349> how

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
me almost forever trying to find a how

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.290 
me almost forever trying to find a how
to<00:00:10.410> hack<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.340> make<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.610> better<00:00:11.940> work

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
to hack it and make it better work

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.499 
to hack it and make it better work
without<00:00:13.019> having<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.549> floppy<00:00:14.880> drive<00:00:15.179> for

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
without having the the floppy drive for

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.820 
without having the the floppy drive for
a<00:00:15.540> microcontroller<00:00:16.379> or<00:00:16.470> whatever<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> have

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
a microcontroller or whatever so I have

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.790 
a microcontroller or whatever so I have
to<00:00:20.010> solder<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.699> pins<00:00:21.000> together<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.990> solder

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
to solder some pins together and solder

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
to solder some pins together and solder
separate<00:00:23.279> wire<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:28.519> carved<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.699> part<00:00:30.029> out

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
separate wire so I carved that part out

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.740 
separate wire so I carved that part out
so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> bridge<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> don't

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so I can use this as a bridge so I don't

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.549 
so I can use this as a bridge so I don't
have<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> connect<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> wire<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> way

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
have to connect the wire all the way

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
have to connect the wire all the way
solder<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:38.010> pins<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:41.629> solder

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
solder the two pins on this and solder

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.160 
solder the two pins on this and solder
wire<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:43.950> pin<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:45.480> connect<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.960> another

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
wire to one pin to connect with another

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.470 
wire to one pin to connect with another
so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.230> could<00:00:49.559> use<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> power<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:51.000> homemade

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
so I could use this to power my homemade

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
so I could use this to power my homemade
ax<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> generator<00:00:54.590> which<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.280> basic

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
ax and generator which is just a basic

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.959 
ax and generator which is just a basic
capacitor<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> LED<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:01.940> resistor<00:01:02.940> or

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
capacitor and LED also a resistor or

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.010 
capacitor and LED also a resistor or
something<00:01:03.480> i've<00:01:03.780> called<00:01:04.049> skull<00:01:04.470> yeah<00:01:06.020> folks

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
something i've called skull yeah folks

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.090 
something i've called skull yeah folks
powering<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> 7.2<00:01:09.360> volt<00:01:10.350> battery<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.950> now

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:24.370 

very<00:01:14.100> torquey<00:01:14.460> motor

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.800 

after<00:01:25.189> two<00:01:25.460> ultra-bright<00:01:27.100> tiny<00:01:28.100> LEDs<00:01:28.810> this

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
after two ultra-bright tiny LEDs this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
after two ultra-bright tiny LEDs this
out<00:01:30.049> of<00:01:30.200> an<00:01:30.350> LCD<00:01:31.840> forgot<00:01:32.840> what<00:01:33.020> work<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:33.590> I

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
out of an LCD forgot what work but I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:47.859 
out of an LCD forgot what work but I
think<00:01:34.520> over<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.790> phone<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:35.799> it's<00:01:36.799> very<00:01:37.130> bright

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.950 

the<00:01:48.350> way<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.590> got<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.250> run<00:01:49.460> very<00:01:50.060> fast<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:52.399> by

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the way I got it to run very fast is by

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.690 
the way I got it to run very fast is by
raising<00:01:53.960> up<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.680> whole<00:01:55.490> disk<00:01:56.680> up<00:01:57.680> by<00:01:58.100> bit<00:01:58.430> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
raising up the whole disk up by bit and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.859 
raising up the whole disk up by bit and
a<00:01:59.000> bypasses<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.049> sensors<00:02:00.829> in<00:02:01.130> here<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.750> it

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
a bypasses the sensors in here so it

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.859 
a bypasses the sensors in here so it
runs<00:02:03.049> fast<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.770> don't<00:02:04.340> know<00:02:04.429> why<00:02:04.640> but<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.659> works

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
runs fast I don't know why but it works

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.300 
runs fast I don't know why but it works
that<00:02:06.110> way<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.649> put<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.130> sniff<00:02:07.520> some<00:02:09.130> pieces<00:02:10.130> of

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
that way so I put I sniff some pieces of

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.030 
that way so I put I sniff some pieces of
wire<00:02:11.380> with<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.560> plastic<00:02:14.530> coating<00:02:15.530> whatever

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
wire with the plastic coating whatever

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.900 
wire with the plastic coating whatever
and<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.940> put<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.269> on<00:02:17.480> there<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.310> will

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and I put it on there so that it will

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.880 
and I put it on there so that it will
raise<00:02:20.330> up<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.750> motor<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.680> runs

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
raise up the motor of it and it runs

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.309 
raise up the motor of it and it runs
fast<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.239> take<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.600> out<00:02:23.660> right<00:02:24.019> now<00:02:24.170> and

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
fast so if I take that out right now and

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.539 
fast so if I take that out right now and
put<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.590> down<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.950> runs<00:02:25.160> about<00:02:26.230> thirty<00:02:27.549> thirty

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
put it down and runs about thirty thirty

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.020 
put it down and runs about thirty thirty
to<00:02:28.819> forty<00:02:29.180> rpm<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:30.769> running<00:02:31.280> about<00:02:31.730> like

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
to forty rpm and now running about like

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.650 
to forty rpm and now running about like
at<00:02:32.480> least<00:02:34.299> 5,000<00:02:35.299> rpm<00:02:35.720> oh<00:02:37.060> well<00:02:38.060> here's<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
at least 5,000 rpm oh well here's the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.729 
at least 5,000 rpm oh well here's the
motor<00:02:38.870> off<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.630> show<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.900> how<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.200> made<00:02:42.560> this

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
motor off as I show you how I made this

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.680 
motor off as I show you how I made this
thing<00:02:43.010> go<00:02:43.849> faster<00:02:45.069> as<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.459> see<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.060> don't<00:02:47.480> know

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
thing go faster as you see I don't know

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.289 
thing go faster as you see I don't know
if<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.900> can<00:02:48.049> see<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.440> but<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.370> there<00:02:49.610> there's

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
if you can see that but in there there's

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.300 
if you can see that but in there there's
some<00:02:50.540> pieces<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:51.140> wire<00:02:52.040> hard<00:02:52.640> wire<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.799> putting

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
some pieces of wire hard wire so putting

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.870 
some pieces of wire hard wire so putting
this<00:02:55.579> on<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.959> bearing<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:58.070> lifts<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.579> up<00:02:58.700> a

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
this on in the bearing it lifts it up a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.799 
this on in the bearing it lifts it up a
bit<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.209> makes<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.780> run<00:03:00.290> faster
