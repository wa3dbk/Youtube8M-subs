00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
back of the PlayStation 4 that connector

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.230 
back of the PlayStation 4 that connector
plugs<00:04:23.080> into<00:04:23.199> an<00:04:23.470> adapter<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.520> adapter

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
plugs into an adapter that adapter

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.840 
plugs into an adapter that adapter
splits<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.050> sound<00:04:26.289> from<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.650> optical<00:04:27.250> into

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
splits the sound from that optical into

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.210 
splits the sound from that optical into
an<00:04:28.090> RCA<00:04:28.600> stereo<00:04:29.050> mix<00:04:29.500> which<00:04:29.710> goes<00:04:29.889> into<00:04:30.130> my

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
an RCA stereo mix which goes into my

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.920 
an RCA stereo mix which goes into my
mixer<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:30.729> then<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.030> has<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> 3.5<00:04:31.419> millimeter

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
mixer and then it has a 3.5 millimeter

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.450 
mixer and then it has a 3.5 millimeter
out<00:04:32.200> that's<00:04:32.650> what<00:04:32.860> my<00:04:32.950> headphones<00:04:33.280> are

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
out that's what my headphones are

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.340 
out that's what my headphones are
connected<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.419> right<00:04:34.630> now<00:04:34.750> my<00:04:34.960> headphones

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
connected to so right now my headphones

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.219 
connected to so right now my headphones
up<00:04:35.530> must<00:04:35.770> be<00:04:35.919> driving<00:04:36.460> sound<00:04:36.760> back<00:04:37.570> into<00:04:38.080> that

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
up must be driving sound back into that

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.800 
up must be driving sound back into that
3.5<00:04:39.070> millimeter<00:04:39.610> connector<00:04:39.880> into<00:04:40.660> that

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
3.5 millimeter connector into that

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.450 
3.5 millimeter connector into that
device<00:04:41.169> that's<00:04:41.770> sending<00:04:41.950> this<00:04:42.099> out<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.280> my

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
device that's sending this out to my

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.330 
device that's sending this out to my
mixer<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.780> that's<00:04:44.320> what<00:04:44.530> my<00:04:44.740> mix<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.070> getting

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
mixer so that's what my mix is getting

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.180 
mixer so that's what my mix is getting
sound<00:04:45.580> from<00:04:46.410> from<00:04:47.410> both<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.680> PlayStation<00:04:47.889> 4

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.700 
you're out you're saying that the 3.5
milimeter<00:07:06.030> out<00:07:06.210> is<00:07:06.450> sending<00:07:06.870> a<00:07:07.050> line<00:07:07.350> level

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
milimeter out is sending a line level

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.530 
milimeter out is sending a line level
signal<00:07:07.860> right<00:07:08.460> which<00:07:08.820> means<00:07:09.000> there's<00:07:09.240> like<00:07:09.360> no

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
signal right which means there's like no

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.330 
signal right which means there's like no
amplification<00:07:09.810> which<00:07:10.680> means<00:07:10.919> it<00:07:11.130> shouldn't

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
amplification which means it shouldn't

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.950 
amplification which means it shouldn't
be<00:07:11.490> able<00:07:11.639> to<00:07:11.730> drive<00:07:11.940> like<00:07:12.240> like<00:07:12.690> an<00:07:12.810> act

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
be able to drive like like an act

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.480 
be able to drive like like an act
anything<00:07:13.290> it's<00:07:13.800> just<00:07:14.040> sending<00:07:14.190> a<00:07:14.310> signal

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
anything it's just sending a signal

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.100 
anything it's just sending a signal
that's<00:07:14.760> supposed<00:07:15.000> to<00:07:15.060> go<00:07:15.210> to<00:07:15.270> some<00:07:15.570> other<00:07:15.780> kind

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
that's supposed to go to some other kind

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.930 
that's supposed to go to some other kind
of<00:07:16.350> device<00:07:16.830> that<00:07:16.860> does<00:07:17.280> have<00:07:17.520> amplification

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
of device that does have amplification

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.900 
of device that does have amplification
right<00:07:18.389> like<00:07:18.810> either<00:07:18.990> a<00:07:19.280> like<00:07:20.280> an<00:07:20.400> amplifier<00:07:20.880> of

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
right like either a like an amplifier of

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.159 
right like either a like an amplifier of
some<00:07:21.270> kind<00:07:21.479> right<00:07:21.690> is<00:07:21.840> that<00:07:21.870> what<00:07:22.050> you're

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
some kind right is that what you're

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.390 
some kind right is that what you're
saying<00:07:22.380> that's<00:07:22.590> what<00:07:22.710> it's<00:07:22.830> meant<00:07:22.919> for<00:07:23.040> I

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
saying that's what it's meant for I

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.790 
saying that's what it's meant for I
think<00:07:24.180> right<00:07:24.360> so<00:07:24.540> if<00:07:24.630> I<00:07:24.720> understand<00:07:25.169> that<00:07:25.229> why

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
think right so if I understand that why

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.650 
think right so if I understand that why
why<00:07:26.160> would<00:07:26.340> my<00:07:26.430> headphones<00:07:26.820> be<00:07:27.030> sending<00:07:27.360> audio

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
why would my headphones be sending audio

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.379 
why would my headphones be sending audio
back<00:07:27.990> to<00:07:28.229> the<00:07:28.380> back<00:07:28.830> to<00:07:28.950> the<00:07:29.040> device<00:07:29.340> why<00:07:30.210> would

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:30.389 
back to the back to the device why would

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:32.090 
back to the back to the device why would
why<00:07:30.630> would<00:07:30.660> the<00:07:30.870> device<00:07:31.110> be<00:07:31.290> accepting<00:07:31.830> audio

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.100 
why would the device be accepting audio

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.280 
why would the device be accepting audio
back<00:07:32.370> or<00:07:33.210> is<00:07:33.330> that<00:07:33.479> just<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:33.780> nature<00:07:33.990> of<00:07:34.139> a

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
back or is that just the nature of a

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.080 
back or is that just the nature of a
line<00:07:34.470> level<00:07:34.680> output<00:07:35.130> because<00:07:35.790> there's<00:07:35.970> no

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
line level output because there's no

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.640 
line level output because there's no
like<00:07:36.300> resistance<00:07:36.780> or<00:07:36.990> anything<00:07:37.200> on<00:07:37.440> the<00:07:37.530> other

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
like resistance or anything on the other

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.320 
like resistance or anything on the other
side<00:07:37.919> then<00:07:38.250> the<00:07:38.340> audio<00:07:38.610> just<00:07:38.760> travels<00:07:39.150> back

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
side then the audio just travels back

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.730 
side then the audio just travels back
through<00:07:39.570> and<00:07:39.720> I<00:07:39.780> am<00:07:39.900> I<00:07:39.990> like<00:07:40.200> making<00:07:40.410> shit<00:07:40.650> up

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 
through and I am I like making shit up

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.850 
through and I am I like making shit up
or<00:07:40.950> is<00:07:41.040> that<00:07:41.100> how<00:07:41.220> that<00:07:41.250> works<00:07:41.400> sir
