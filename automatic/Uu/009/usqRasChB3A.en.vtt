00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.019 
this video has been very highly
anticipated<00:00:21.780> if<00:00:22.350> you've<00:00:22.650> seen<00:00:22.950> my<00:00:23.100> room<00:00:23.520> about

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
anticipated if you've seen my room about

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.690 
anticipated if you've seen my room about
4<00:00:24.360> years<00:00:24.510> ago<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.950> is<00:00:26.130> exactly<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
4 years ago I think this is exactly the

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.960 
4 years ago I think this is exactly the
same<00:00:26.850> room<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.810> just

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
same room we just really just

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
same room we just really just
transformed<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.150> repainted<00:00:31.020> it<00:00:31.259> and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
transformed it repainted it and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
transformed it repainted it and
everything<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.520> exactly<00:00:32.940> how<00:00:33.210> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
everything so this is exactly how you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
everything so this is exactly how you
would<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.900> when<00:00:34.050> you're<00:00:34.170> walking<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.770> from

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
would see it when you're walking in from

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.819 
would see it when you're walking in from
the<00:00:35.730> door<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:37.140> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> start<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.680> with

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
that's actually where you guys see as my

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.020 
that's actually where you guys see as my
background<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:41.910> videos<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.950> this<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.280> kind

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
background in my videos so this is kind

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
background in my videos so this is kind
of<00:00:45.120> where<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> put<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.020> things<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> use

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
of where I put all the things that I use

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
of where I put all the things that I use
almost<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> everyday<00:00:47.760> basis<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
almost on everyday basis but I like to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.580 
almost on everyday basis but I like to
use<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:50.219> design<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.449> decoration<00:00:52.350> for

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
use it as my design or decoration for

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
use it as my design or decoration for
the<00:00:52.649> room<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> work<00:00:54.750> as

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the room as well so it's kind of work as

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
the room as well so it's kind of work as
two<00:00:55.079> purposes<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> here's<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.769> closer<00:00:59.039> look<00:00:59.399> at

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
two purposes so here's a closer look at

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.209 
two purposes so here's a closer look at
the<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> wall<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.219> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the right side of the wall and so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
the right side of the wall and so
basically<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.059> wanted<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
basically I wanted it to be just kind of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.280 
basically I wanted it to be just kind of
like<00:01:04.710> shelvings<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.730> make<00:01:06.480> it<00:01:06.630> practical<00:01:07.170> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
like shelvings and make it practical you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.390 
like shelvings and make it practical you
know<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.620> though<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.860> using<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.280> as

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
know even though I'm using it as

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
know even though I'm using it as
decorations<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> still<00:01:09.630> wanted<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.080> able<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
decorations I still wanted to be able to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.890 
decorations I still wanted to be able to
use<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:12.210> side<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.750> white

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
use it so on the right side the white

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
use it so on the right side the white
shelf<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.980> a<00:01:14.010> desk<00:01:14.550> but<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.540> remove

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
shelf is actually a desk but we remove

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.540 
shelf is actually a desk but we remove
the<00:01:15.990> desk<00:01:16.230> part<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.220> attached

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
the desk part that was actually attached

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.850 
the desk part that was actually attached
to<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.480> use<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.259> shelf

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to it and we just use it as a shelf

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
to it and we just use it as a shelf
so<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.689> some<00:01:21.840> stuff

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
so this is just like just some stuff

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.140 
so this is just like just some stuff
that<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.290> use<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.829> everyday<00:01:23.130> basis<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.939> well<00:01:24.090> as
