00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
create a main content section and I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.340 
create a main content section and I
don't<00:02:47.700> put<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.120> color<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.600> there<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.170> going

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
sections but if we didn't it would get

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.430

the browser by default puts in that

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.870 
the browser by default puts in that
extra<00:03:09.990> margin<00:03:10.290> space<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.460> don't<00:03:11.670> want

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
extra margin space and we don't want

that in this web layout we're doing so

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.470 
that in this web layout we're doing so
we're<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.400> override<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.270> and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
we're going to just override that and

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.770 
we're going to just override that and
set<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.080> zero<00:03:16.800> pixels<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.360> will

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
set that to zero pixels so that will

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.990 
set that to zero pixels so that will
eliminate<00:03:19.140> all<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.830> extra<00:03:20.280> margin<00:03:20.550> space

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
eliminate all the extra margin space

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.850 
eliminate all the extra margin space
that<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.300> browser<00:03:21.570> tries<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.110> create<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
that the browser tries to create on the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.350 
that the browser tries to create on the
edges<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.400> let's<00:03:23.760> go<00:03:23.880> ahead<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.150> save<00:03:24.330> that

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
edges so let's go ahead and save that

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.170 
edges so let's go ahead and save that
there's<00:03:25.020> nothing<00:03:25.170> really<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.590> see<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.180> if

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
there's nothing really to see there if

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.250 
there's nothing really to see there if
we<00:03:27.330> load<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.840> won't<00:03:27.960> really<00:03:28.140> see

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
we load this you won't really see

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.810 
we load this you won't really see
anything<00:03:28.650> because<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.250> don't<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.550> any<00:03:29.700> other

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
anything because we don't have any other

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.390 
anything because we don't have any other
elements<00:03:30.330> in<00:03:30.420> here<00:03:30.630> yet<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:31.740> we<00:03:31.890> would<00:03:32.070> notice

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
elements in here yet but we would notice

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.980 
elements in here yet but we would notice
it<00:03:32.580> if<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:32.910> had<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> bunch<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.390> elements<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:33.840> here

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
it if we had a bunch of elements in here

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.930 
it if we had a bunch of elements in here
so<00:03:34.230> let's<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.920> ahead<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.520> close<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
so let's just go ahead and close that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.660 
so let's just go ahead and close that
out<00:03:36.480> next<00:03:37.260> we're<00:03:37.410> going<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> set<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:38.100> font<00:03:38.550> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
out next we're going to set a font that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.550 
out next we're going to set a font that
we<00:03:38.880> want<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.180> use<00:03:39.360> throughout<00:03:39.720> our<00:03:40.020> web<00:03:40.260> page

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and if the web browser can't locate that

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.290 
and if the web browser can't locate that
font<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.470> will<00:03:49.710> load<00:03:50.040> Georgia<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.210> it

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
font it will load Georgia and if it

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.240 
font it will load Georgia and if it
can't<00:03:51.510> load<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.930> font<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.470> will<00:03:52.680> load<00:03:52.860> serif'

want to load so this is a good way to

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.550 
want to load so this is a good way to
set<00:04:11.940> up<00:04:11.970> some<00:04:12.210> nice<00:04:12.390> inheritance<00:04:12.720> because

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
set up some nice inheritance because

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440 
set up some nice inheritance because
every<00:04:13.890> child<00:04:14.190> element<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.880> we<00:04:15.000> put<00:04:15.270> out

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
every child element that we put out

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.420 
every child element that we put out
there<00:04:15.480> now<00:04:15.870> all<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.260> content<00:04:16.830> panes<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.310> we

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
there now all the content panes that we

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.580 
there now all the content panes that we
do<00:04:17.580> will<00:04:18.090> automatically<00:04:18.810> put<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.170> Verdana

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
do will automatically put the Verdana

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.830 
do will automatically put the Verdana
font<00:04:19.739> out<00:04:20.280> there<00:04:20.670> in<00:04:20.880> those<00:04:21.090> child<00:04:21.390> elements

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
font out there in those child elements

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.810 
font out there in those child elements
we<00:04:21.960> don't<00:04:22.230> have<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.560> do<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:22.950> because<00:04:23.490> we

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
we don't have to do it now because we

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.360 
we don't have to do it now because we
set<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.210> up<00:04:24.330> here<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.410> body<00:04:25.680> section<00:04:26.010> so

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
set it up here in the body section so

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.950 
set it up here in the body section so
that<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.580> could<00:04:26.700> be<00:04:26.790> an

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
that it could be an

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.200 
that it could be an
heritage<00:04:27.350> later<00:04:27.620> so<00:04:28.130> again<00:04:28.699> this<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:29.030> always

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
heritage later so again this is always

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.990 
heritage later so again this is always
good<00:04:29.569> practice<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:30.259> set<00:04:30.470> your<00:04:30.590> fonts<00:04:31.130> first<00:04:31.669> in

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
good practice to set your fonts first in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.719 
good practice to set your fonts first in
the<00:04:32.419> body<00:04:32.810> rule<00:04:33.229> set<00:04:33.590> okay<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:34.160> let's<00:04:34.430> move<00:04:34.550> on

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
the body rule set okay so let's move on

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.120 
the body rule set okay so let's move on
now<00:04:34.940> we<00:04:35.270> want<00:04:35.539> to<00:04:35.630> set<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.930> font<00:04:36.199> default<00:04:36.860> size

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
now we want to set the font default size

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.770 
now we want to set the font default size
that<00:04:37.400> we<00:04:37.520> want<00:04:37.669> throughout<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.180> webpage<00:04:38.539> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
that we want throughout the webpage and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.830 
that we want throughout the webpage and
in<00:04:39.500> this<00:04:39.680> case<00:04:39.979> I'm<00:04:40.250> going<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.460> set<00:04:40.699> this<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.940> 14

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
in this case I'm going to set this to 14

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.110 
in this case I'm going to set this to 14
pixels<00:04:42.590> now<00:04:43.039> again<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.520> can<00:04:43.699> set<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.060> to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
pixels now again you can set this to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.820 
pixels now again you can set this to
what<00:04:44.360> you<00:04:44.479> want<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:45.080> may<00:04:45.289> just<00:04:45.470> want<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.710> use

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
what you want you may just want to use

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.050 
what you want you may just want to use
the<00:04:45.919> key<00:04:46.130> word<00:04:46.160> remember<00:04:46.520> we<00:04:46.759> talked<00:04:46.970> about

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
the key word remember we talked about

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.540 
the key word remember we talked about
that<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.539> CSS<00:04:48.020> series<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:48.740> can<00:04:48.889> put<00:04:49.130> small

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
that in the CSS series you can put small

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.070 
that in the CSS series you can put small
medium<00:04:50.210> or<00:04:50.419> large

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
medium or large

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.100 
medium or large
now<00:04:51.530> most<00:04:51.979> websites<00:04:52.520> will<00:04:53.180> use<00:04:53.419> small<00:04:53.870> or

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
now most websites will use small or

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.010 
now most websites will use small or
medium<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.710> this<00:04:55.130> 14<00:04:55.610> pixels<00:04:56.000> equals<00:04:56.599> of<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
medium and this 14 pixels equals of the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.129 
medium and this 14 pixels equals of the
smaller<00:04:57.349> pixel<00:04:58.190> size<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.849> remember<00:04:59.449> we<00:04:59.960> can

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
smaller pixel size but remember we can

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.620 
smaller pixel size but remember we can
expand<00:05:00.710> this<00:05:00.860> out<00:05:01.099> through<00:05:01.330> percentages<00:05:02.330> in

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
expand this out through percentages in

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.480 
expand this out through percentages in
the<00:05:02.960> child<00:05:03.440> elements<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.949> we<00:05:04.070> put<00:05:04.280> in<00:05:04.370> the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
the child elements that we put in the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.740 
the child elements that we put in the
body<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.970> I'll<00:05:05.060> show<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.389> in<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.720> few

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
body and I'll show you that in a few

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.999 
body and I'll show you that in a few
videos<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:06.380> we<00:05:06.440> did<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:06.979> last

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
videos and we did that in the last

series<00:05:07.520> as<00:05:07.639> well<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.300> we're<00:05:08.419> going<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.570> do

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
series as well and we're going to do

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.879

setting<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.550> default<00:05:11.000> font<00:05:11.240> size<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.780> we

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
setting the default font size that we

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.770 
setting the default font size that we
want<00:05:12.080> throughout<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.710> website<00:05:13.130> at<00:05:13.340> 14<00:05:14.240> pixels

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
want throughout the website at 14 pixels

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.140 
want throughout the website at 14 pixels
and<00:05:15.050> so<00:05:15.530> let's<00:05:15.740> save<00:05:15.979> this<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.370> again<00:05:16.940> if<00:05:17.060> we

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
and so let's save this and again if we

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.399 
and so let's save this and again if we
open<00:05:17.389> this<00:05:17.449> up<00:05:17.599> we're<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:17.780> going<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.050> see<00:05:18.229> much

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
open this up we're not going to see much

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.129 
open this up we're not going to see much
at<00:05:18.560> this<00:05:18.680> point<00:05:19.009> but<00:05:19.849> yeah<00:05:20.539> there's<00:05:20.810> not<00:05:20.930> much

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
at this point but yeah there's not much

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
these properties will become more

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.320
