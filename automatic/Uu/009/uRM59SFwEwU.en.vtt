listening to the MIDI things

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.180 
listening to the MIDI things
so<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.739> turn<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.160> out<00:02:14.200> now<00:02:15.200> again<00:02:15.500> back<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.800> this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
so we turn it out now again back to this

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.619 
so we turn it out now again back to this
the<00:02:17.000> recording<00:02:17.480> controls<00:02:18.879> I'm<00:02:19.879> doing<00:02:20.239> stereo
