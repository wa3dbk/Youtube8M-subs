justice they look horrible

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.450 
justice they look horrible
but<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.429> know<00:00:35.609> Ruby<00:00:36.179> is<00:00:36.359> still<00:00:36.739> not<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.890> big<00:00:38.190> as

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
but you know Ruby is still not as big as

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.299 
but you know Ruby is still not as big as
I<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.899> huge<00:00:40.469> Japanese<00:00:40.679> production

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I don't know a huge Japanese production

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
I don't know a huge Japanese production
for<00:00:42.300> example

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
for example

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
for example
salamu<00:00:43.769> nor<00:00:44.039> a<00:00:44.070> fairy<00:00:44.309> tale<00:00:44.519> or<00:00:44.579> something

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
salamu nor a fairy tale or something

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.739 
salamu nor a fairy tale or something
like<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.589> Ruby<00:00:46.589> is<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:46.949> American<00:00:47.460> anime<00:00:48.449> it's

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
like that Ruby is an American anime it's

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.200 
like that Ruby is an American anime it's
not<00:00:49.260> Jeff<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.769> Japanese<00:00:49.980> inspired<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:51.030> it's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
not Jeff it's Japanese inspired but it's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.059 
not Jeff it's Japanese inspired but it's
American<00:00:51.719> animated<00:00:52.109> hence<00:00:52.440> why<00:00:52.679> they<00:00:52.859> have<00:00:52.980> an

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:53.069 
American animated hence why they have an

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:55.369 
American animated hence why they have an
American<00:00:53.219> company<00:00:53.839> making<00:00:54.839> their<00:00:54.989> figures

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
American company making their figures

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
American company making their figures
and<00:00:55.789> hence<00:00:56.789> why<00:00:56.999> you<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.269> look<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.569> great

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and hence why you don't look that great

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.430 
and hence why you don't look that great
so<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:59.339> just<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.729> cents<00:01:00.229> this<00:01:01.229> is<00:01:01.319> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so that's just my two cents this is the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
so that's just my two cents this is the
last<00:01:01.620> Ruby<00:01:01.949> figure<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.969> be

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

outside for a box now I must admit it is

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.240 
outside for a box now I must admit it is
not<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.510> bad<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:55.530> pretty<00:01:55.830> decent

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
not that bad it's actually pretty decent

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.120

I<00:01:56.460> mean<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.540> course<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.020> still<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.830> not

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I mean of course it's still you know not

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.210 
I mean of course it's still you know not
that<00:01:59.160> great<00:01:59.910> of<00:02:00.410> big<00:02:01.410> difference<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:01.920> terms<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that great of big difference in terms of

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.940 
that great of big difference in terms of
quality<00:02:02.640> when<00:02:03.480> you're<00:02:03.690> comparing<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.230> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
quality when you're comparing it to the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.220 
quality when you're comparing it to the
other<00:02:05.160> three<00:02:05.460> figures<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:06.720> still<00:02:07.020> good

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
other three figures but it is still good

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.199 
other three figures but it is still good
I<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.980> think<00:02:08.159> it's<00:02:08.489> part<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> best<00:02:08.939> one<00:02:09.179> out
