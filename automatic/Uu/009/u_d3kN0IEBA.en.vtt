and<00:00:56.879> came<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.710> classic<00:00:59.100> design<00:00:59.640> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and came up with a classic design that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.260 
and came up with a classic design that
was<00:01:00.510> clean<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.350> light<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.920> simple<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
was clean and light and simple this is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.490 
was clean and light and simple this is
something<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.809> deal<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.019> every<00:01:04.470> day

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
something that they deal with every day

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
something that they deal with every day
and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.880> seems<00:01:06.090> silly<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> say<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and I know it seems silly to say that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.270 
and I know it seems silly to say that
it's<00:01:07.020> life-changing<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.100> be

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's life-changing but it can be

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.730 
it's life-changing but it can be
life-changing<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.270> mean<00:01:09.600> every<00:01:10.110> person<00:01:10.560> walks

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
life-changing I mean every person walks

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
life-changing I mean every person walks
in<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:12.119> opens<00:01:12.510> their<00:01:12.900> closet<00:01:13.470> door<00:01:13.729> at<00:01:14.729> least

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
two times a day maybe three it's really

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.830 
two times a day maybe three it's really
helped<00:01:18.990> me<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:20.310> three<00:01:20.670> daughters<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

getting<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> morning<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> getting

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
getting up in the morning and getting

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.130 
getting up in the morning and getting
ready<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.060> other<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.420> too<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.659> being

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

organized or having an organized home as

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.520 
organized or having an organized home as
I<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> gives<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.049> time<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:30.530> most

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
I think it gives you time and most

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.600 
I think it gives you time and most
people<00:01:31.740> busy<00:01:32.460> families<00:01:33.290> working

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
people busy families working

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
people busy families working
professionals<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.970> most<00:01:36.180> people<00:01:36.780> that's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
professionals I think most people that's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
professionals I think most people that's
what<00:01:37.380> they're<00:01:37.530> looking<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.549> than

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
anything right now it's just time Kim

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140 
anything right now it's just time Kim
knew<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.009> she<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.729> able<00:01:41.850> to
