 hereford from the valley and marta vila area 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:49.540
 moret recognized as the number one 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.540
 country this fate destination 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.700
 then I did not know but now

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.070
 the gates 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.390
 well that started in 76 we had the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.330
 opportunity to buy here in our 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.920
 first 60 hectares we brought our 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.590
 first heifers for pure herd 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.750
 registered from belgrano to here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.820
 and a couple of years later we bought the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.609
 first pedigree females and that's where it started 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.159
 everything and here we are never ever stop 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.399
 It really is a company that you 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.799
 We have dedicated 35-40 years of our 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.319
 life with a huge huge enthusiasm 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.610
 passion is what we like and we are very 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.409
 happy with what we do for 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.640
 course company that you take seriously 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.590
 it takes an effort and responsibility 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.030
 from now but also you have to 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.829
 like then when you like to do 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.829
 things the effort is diminished 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.880
 well thank you we are seeing all the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.920
 registered cigars xerez form 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.020
 what characteristics do these have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 our bulls that are fulfilling the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.759
 two years are bulls but registered that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.810
 go to our auctions for oscar knots 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 deep rib two really bulls 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.009
 very useful of very good displacement 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.009
 good development and good butchers 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.950
 since a few years ago we started 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.840
 breed angus both pure controlled as 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.599
 to ask for this is a rodeo of pure bulls 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.420
 controlled and also fulfilling two 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.370
 years in spring that are going to be 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.440
 seen in our auctions of the year 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.380
 we are very satisfied with how we are 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.100
 also evolving into something 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.110
 she remember in my singing 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.640
 these are some of the bulls that are going to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.240
 go to exhibitions this year as 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.610
 individual bulls hereford and angus 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.200
 really good I think they are from the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.480
 best angels that we have with good 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.100
 mothers all very useful in any 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.690
 rodeo 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.910
 when you are from home 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.020
 this is the future are our calves 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.970
 of the 2012 males and females that are the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.380
 base of the future a cottage is measured by 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.330
 the quality of their calves because that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.680
 implies that the cabin goes in good 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.879
 direction regarding genetic progress 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.879
 my life 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.069
 this bull was champion two years and third 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.200
 best bull from palermo last year is 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.719
 a very nice bull son the one celebrated 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.790
 of our parents and is a bull that 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.819
 I really think it's going to be important 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.530
 as a father for race one the 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.620
 heifer was reserved great champion 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.290
 from palermo last year we learned from 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.260
 50% on the record price of the year I think that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.340
 is what a hereford cow should be 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.489
 great heifer for our taste 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.239
 and surely will compete in Palermo east 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.239
 year again 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.599
 then they are an innovation that is the 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.450
 embryo transplant or how was that 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.310
 good us at the beginning like no 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.459
 we had cows and at that time I do not know 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.120
 they sold cows to ask is very easily 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.280
 We made agreements with the main 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.680
 cabins of the country we put the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.290
 semen that we brought especially the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.910
 ejido and they put the cows and what 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 we did through the transplants of 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.120
 embryos that at that time did not have the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.980
 popularity that you have today and then 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.650
 We distributed the embryos in that way 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.950
 we became a mother's group and so 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.229
 we started already we take more than four thousand 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.449
 and peak 5,000 births of transplants 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.609
 since we are one of the cabins that 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.820
 intensely one used what kind of 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.470
 animal basically seek being wants 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.289
 for a carnivorous race we look for 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.020
 animals that have a lot of meat that are 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.610
 wide and deep in their rooms 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.979
 back where the cuts are most 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.470
 valuable ones that have good arch of 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.949
 rib that are animals very well 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.199
 structured docile because the race that 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.699
 it is one of its characteristics we look for 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.000
 also females fertile females 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.160
 female 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.290
 and send your calves and that set 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.330
 added to the objective data that we 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.580
 will provide the technology and that we 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.030
 we do with each of our 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.730
 cows allows one more production 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.950
 efficient the race is how soft they are 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.780
 of fattening the rooms that have the 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.020
 rib that they have their conferences 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.090
 scrotal is your way of how rich it is 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.550
 the meat let's say and especially all its 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.320
 part of musculature is not true that no 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.830
 is what you want, look what is two 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.720
 Bulls 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.300
 see what it means to believe that you 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.820
 brings a woman to manage a cabin 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.360
 out there women are more retailers 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.860
 more to look at pavadas than men 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.870
 they do not see her 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.610
 and good but basically in the case 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.460
 our cute was that we put one thing together 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.520
 of two where we do not interpose and in 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.740
 where we have a name and we like what 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.270
 alone that we do and well I think that 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.610
 basically it's not my contribution was 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.620
 collaborate on this from always because 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.250
 that was a great challenge when we took off 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.639
 not doing it of two and good intuition 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.819
 prayer that the woman brings 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.889
 quite by the way that is a case 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.840
 curious because normally it does not happen that 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.210
 a couple both pursue the same 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.979
 objective and that is not competitive or 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.469
 our two doctors know who is better 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.069
 two lawyers know who is better we go 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.110
 together 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.729
 Marta super many things I was occupied 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.279
 many others what expectations have 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.919
 for palermo for this year there is always 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:20.469
 dreams we have a good row 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.389
 possibly the best row very many 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.830
 years we have a large row that good 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.150
 the decision will have to be made after 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.550
 last moment which is vain that 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.680
 Thursday they are not going we are very happy with 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.120
 the calves like the calves of 2012 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.069
 They are really nice males and females 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.460
 I think it's going to be one of the best 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.620
 rows that we have had 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.020
 horacio how are you seeing today the 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.699
 situation of Argentine mining today 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.590
 with the difficulties that we know with 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.690
 stable prices and rising costs 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.419
 but livestock is an entity of 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.250
 long term a cow takes nine months and 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.169
 half-way through, so decisions 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.690
 that we are taking today are going to have their 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.220
 effect actually in three years and 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.470
 we are in this and we have love 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.150
 for what we do even if we pass 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.880
 some moments of crisis that is not the 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.069
 first we always look away we look at the 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.860
 future and we know that in the case of 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.800
 cottage all the genetic experience that 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.080
 has been accumulating makes its effect 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.960
 especially in times of crisis and 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.060
 within the context it will improve within 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.190
 of possible his profitability to the two 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.430
 thank you very much for receiving us here 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.080
 It was a pleasure and we learned a lot and more 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.060
 thank you to field men 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.520
 because it is the trajectory that they are 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.750
 having increasingly important and by 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.280
 Of course we are waiting for you with the 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.500
 open gates 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.090
 thank you very much for the visit and 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.770
 again the gates as I said 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.270
 marta are open to all who 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.930
 they want to know us and want to know 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.930
 our hacienda 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.430
 ah
