00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
vendors equipment on the campus and so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
vendors equipment on the campus and so
the<00:01:30.270> whole<00:01:30.450> idea<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> bring<00:01:31.500> everything

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the whole idea was to bring everything

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.520 
the whole idea was to bring everything
together<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.420> order<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> business

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
together and the first order of business

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.880 
together and the first order of business
was<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:36.140> look<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.970> consolidation<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.060> servers

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
was to look at consolidation of servers

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.469 
was to look at consolidation of servers
because<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.520> were<00:01:41.670> having<00:01:41.909> problems<00:01:42.090> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
because we were having problems in

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.620 
because we were having problems in
maintaining<00:01:43.259> those<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.970> infrastructure

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
maintaining those and the infrastructure

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
maintaining those and the infrastructure
became<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> key<00:01:46.729> meaning<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> network

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
became the key meaning the network

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.710 
became the key meaning the network
because<00:01:49.140> everything<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.979> connected

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
because everything had to be connected

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.749 
because everything had to be connected

university we had some we had some

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.800 
university we had some we had some
obstacles<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.369> foresee<00:02:02.909> one

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
obstacles that we did not foresee one

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.469 
obstacles that we did not foresee one
was<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.380> space<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.100> had<00:02:05.460> decided<00:02:05.909> upon

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
was the space that we had decided upon

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.529 
was the space that we had decided upon
to<00:02:07.140> build<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.710> data<00:02:08.489> center<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:08.970> we

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
to build this data center out in we

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.089 
to build this data center out in we
already<00:02:09.810> had<00:02:09.959> some<00:02:10.200> existing<00:02:10.470> equipment<00:02:10.800> in

already had some existing equipment in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.070 
already had some existing equipment in
there<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:11.940> became<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> challenge<00:02:12.900> because

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
there so it became a challenge because

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.840 
there so it became a challenge because
it<00:02:13.620> was

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
it was

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.060 
it was

production equipment we had to keep it
operational<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.600> same<00:02:17.810> time<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.260> had<00:02:18.530> to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
operational at the same time we had to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.030 
operational at the same time we had to
build<00:02:19.340> out<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.760> new<00:02:19.970> space<00:02:20.710> with<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:21.740> help

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
build out this new space with the help

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.250 
build out this new space with the help
of<00:02:22.160> IBM<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.850> PC<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.510> came<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.750> with<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> plan

of IBM and a PC we came up with a plan

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.200 
of IBM and a PC we came up with a plan
to<00:02:24.320> do<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.860> we<00:02:25.100> actually<00:02:25.340> built<00:02:25.910> out<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
to do that we actually built out the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.840 
to do that we actually built out the
data<00:02:26.420> center<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.870> two<00:02:27.080> phases<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:28.310> built<00:02:28.640> out

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
data center in two phases we built out

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.650 
data center in two phases we built out
the<00:02:29.300> space<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:30.200> was<00:02:30.500> not<00:02:30.710> surrounding<00:02:31.400> our

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the space that was not surrounding our

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.700 
the space that was not surrounding our
equipment<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:32.960> already<00:02:33.380> up<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
equipment that was already up and

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.310 
equipment that was already up and
running<00:02:34.060> then<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.240> took<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.570> opportunity<00:02:35.840> to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
running then we took the opportunity to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.900 
running then we took the opportunity to
move<00:02:36.530> our<00:02:36.710> equipment<00:02:37.160> into<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.550> finished

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
move our equipment into that finished

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.100 
move our equipment into that finished
space<00:02:38.120> went<00:02:38.900> back<00:02:39.080> later<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.760> finish<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
space went back later and and finish the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.220 
space went back later and and finish the
remaining<00:02:42.380> space<00:02:42.830> what<00:02:43.610> made<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
remaining space what made it so the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.210 
remaining space what made it so the
timeline<00:02:48.710> so<00:02:48.980> short<00:02:49.400> was<00:02:50.270> because<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
timeline so short was because of the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.370 
timeline so short was because of the
architecture<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.850> we<00:02:53.030> used<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.630> which

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
architecture that we used in that which

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.720 
architecture that we used in that which
IBM<00:02:54.590> terms<00:02:55.130> as<00:02:55.460> their<00:02:55.760> flexible<00:02:56.420> data

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
IBM terms as their flexible data

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.990 
IBM terms as their flexible data
infrastructure<00:02:58.840> which<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.410> pcs<00:03:01.310> components

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
infrastructure which is a pcs components

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.780 
infrastructure which is a pcs components
so<00:03:02.810> we<00:03:02.960> were<00:03:03.080> able<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.560> build<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.980> shell<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.490> data

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
so we were able to build a shell a data

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.090 
so we were able to build a shell a data
center<00:03:05.090> shell<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.600> then<00:03:06.440> within<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.770> day<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.070> a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
center shell and then within a day and a

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.310 
center shell and then within a day and a
half<00:03:07.130> we<00:03:07.970> filled<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.390> shell<00:03:08.750> with<00:03:08.960> all<00:03:09.140> of

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
half we filled that shell with all of

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.530 
half we filled that shell with all of

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
were bringing into that space so there

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.570 
were bringing into that space so there
was<00:03:53.480> no<00:03:53.630> flexibility<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.620> budget<00:03:54.830> at<00:03:55.130> all

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
was no flexibility in that budget at all

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.840 
was no flexibility in that budget at all
and<00:03:56.200> one<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.350> key<00:03:57.500> things<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.310> should

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
and one of the key things that I should

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.720 
and one of the key things that I should
mention<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.420> that<00:03:59.560> when<00:04:00.560> IBM<00:04:00.680> first<00:04:01.220> proposed

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
mention is that when IBM first proposed

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.800 
mention is that when IBM first proposed
this<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.660> us<00:04:02.870> they<00:04:03.200> proposed<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.800> traditional

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
this to us they proposed a traditional

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.750 
this to us they proposed a traditional
legacy<00:04:05.810> data<00:04:05.990> center<00:04:06.410> raised<00:04:06.950> floor<00:04:07.370> crack

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
legacy data center raised floor crack

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.120 
legacy data center raised floor crack

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
units on down the perimeters so did the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.400 
units on down the perimeters so did the
other<00:04:10.280> vendors<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.300> consultants<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.110> that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
other vendors and consultants that that

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.670 
other vendors and consultants that that
we<00:04:12.680> brought<00:04:12.890> in<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.250> talk<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.990> IBM<00:04:14.990> was<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
we brought in to talk to IBM was the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.650 
we brought in to talk to IBM was the
only<00:04:15.830> one<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.130> came<00:04:16.460> back<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.940> us<00:04:17.120> with<00:04:17.570> an

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
only one that came back to us with an

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.140 
only one that came back to us with an
alternative<00:04:18.320> design<00:04:18.770> with<00:04:19.670> this<00:04:19.880> new

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
alternative design with this new

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.659 
alternative design with this new
flexible<00:04:20.750> modular<00:04:20.960> data<00:04:21.650> center<00:04:22.130> which

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
flexible modular data center which

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.790 
flexible modular data center which
eliminated<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.570> race<00:04:23.720> floor<00:04:24.110> which

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
eliminated the race floor which

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.250 
eliminated the race floor which
eliminated<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.490> big<00:04:25.669> cost<00:04:25.910> for<00:04:26.210> us<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:27.110> also

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
eliminated a big cost for us and it also

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.920 
eliminated a big cost for us and it also
took<00:04:27.470> care

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
took care

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.159 
took care
of<00:04:28.009> a<00:04:29.060> limitation<00:04:30.060> we<00:04:30.210> had<00:04:30.449> in<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> space<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
of a limitation we had in the space that

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.740
