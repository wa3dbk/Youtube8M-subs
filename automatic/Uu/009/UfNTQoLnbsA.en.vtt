 more than others do not know how to manage and deploy 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.330
 I will take the light color 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.710

 the parties said my friends 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.720
 even if a stay I will not say that we are going to the top 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.180
 I learned how from the lightest to the darkest 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.870
 whatever the place where I have to spend colors 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.870

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.749

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.829
 in the championship I will take the darkest color and do it 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.059
 set in party 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.969
 the butcher mobile eyelid 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.969
 I will start from the outside 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.149
 the chemist actually draw the eyelid 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.399
 shape of the cup 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.869

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.149
 I'm right in front I cleaned up 119 dead 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.299
 I took the lightest color of the palette 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.279
 and Thursday there is no way in which 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.279
 a little further 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.549

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.409

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.969
 asked 117 there I'll take note of what some say 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.059
 km 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.869

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.649

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.429
 it's a blow the coach of the magpies technique and the couple 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 in the ranking the worst tactical schemes then 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
 I took my colossal 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.139

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.139

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.029
 the audience delighted with the white-nose 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.229
 I think first of all about the site 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.999
 on the up and down this source 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.999
