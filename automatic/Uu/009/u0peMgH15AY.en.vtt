00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.330 
entire face it was so difficult to get
to<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.560> point<00:02:11.009> where<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> actually<00:02:12.260> nail<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.560> this

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
to a point where I actually nail it this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.360 
to a point where I actually nail it this
what<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.269> now<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.720> nothing<00:02:16.380> even<00:02:17.099> close

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
what you see now is nothing even close

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.870 
what you see now is nothing even close
to<00:02:17.970> what<00:02:18.150> he<00:02:18.299> looks<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.200> end<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.760> was

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
to what he looks like in the end it was

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.500 
to what he looks like in the end it was
so<00:02:21.150> difficult<00:02:21.390> either<00:02:21.959> way<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:23.190> yeah<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.090> do

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so difficult either way but yeah I I do

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.360 
so difficult either way but yeah I I do
feel<00:02:24.989> like<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.500> end<00:02:25.530> he<00:02:25.859> looks<00:02:26.100> pretty

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
feel like in the end he looks pretty

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.170 
feel like in the end he looks pretty
good<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:27.620> his<00:02:28.620> nose<00:02:28.980> let's<00:02:29.459> talk<00:02:29.730> about<00:02:29.910> his

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
good so his nose let's talk about his

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.809 
good so his nose let's talk about his
nose<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:31.079> was<00:02:31.319> also<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.769> very<00:02:31.859> difficult<00:02:32.310> part

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
nose this was also a very difficult part

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.020 
nose this was also a very difficult part
to<00:02:33.000> create<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:33.690> Luke<00:02:33.989> but<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:35.819> think

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
to create about Luke but I think I think

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.449 
to create about Luke but I think I think
I<00:02:36.329> got<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.690> pretty<00:02:36.900> good<00:02:37.139> I<00:02:37.170> mean<00:02:37.560> he<00:02:37.859> has<00:02:38.130> this

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
I got it pretty good I mean he has this

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.479 
I got it pretty good I mean he has this
in<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.049> series<00:02:40.440> he<00:02:40.620> has<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.040> nose

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
in the in the series he has this nose

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.370 
in the in the series he has this nose
that<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> can't<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.359> explain<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.019> love

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that I can't really explain but I love

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
that I can't really explain but I love
his<00:02:43.590> nose<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.700> hard<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.209> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
his nose and it was so hard to get to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
his nose and it was so hard to get to
perfection<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.200> I'm<00:02:46.290> such<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> perfectionist

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
perfection and I'm such a perfectionist

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.870 
perfection and I'm such a perfectionist
you<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.359> no<00:02:49.019> idea<00:02:49.440> what<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> perfectionist<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
you have no idea what a perfectionist I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.400 
you have no idea what a perfectionist I
am

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
am

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.130 
am
so<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.550> it's<00:02:53.390> hard<00:02:53.600> for<00:02:53.870> me<00:02:53.960> when

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
so I just think it's hard for me when

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.860 
so I just think it's hard for me when
stuff<00:02:54.500> are<00:02:54.710> not<00:02:54.890> perfect<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.330> have<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.720> get

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
stuff are not perfect so I have to get

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.200 
stuff are not perfect so I have to get
everything<00:02:57.230> right<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:58.550> very<00:02:58.760> hard<00:02:59.090> to

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
everything right so it was very hard to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.290 
everything right so it was very hard to
get<00:02:59.480> everything<00:02:59.810> right<00:03:00.170> but<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.890> think<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.580> did<00:03:02.000> I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
get everything right but I think I did I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.240 
get everything right but I think I did I
don't<00:03:02.540> know<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.860> can<00:03:04.040> comment

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.030 
so right now we are just doing the
finishing<00:04:10.580> touches<00:04:11.240> and<00:04:12.020> I<00:04:12.380> think<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:12.740> kind<00:04:12.950> of

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
finishing touches and I think it kind of

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.690 
finishing touches and I think it kind of
looks<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.400> loop<00:04:13.820> here<00:04:14.209> right<00:04:14.540> he<00:04:15.260> does<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:16.100> bit

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
looks like loop here right he does a bit

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.390 
looks like loop here right he does a bit
maybe<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:17.540> don't<00:04:17.900> know<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:19.040> think<00:04:19.280> he

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
maybe I don't know I I just think he

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.620 
maybe I don't know I I just think he
does<00:04:20.200> anyways<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.770> do<00:04:22.370> hope<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:23.210> lot<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.570> you
