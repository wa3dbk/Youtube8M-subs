00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
ton and I need a ton of people have and
that<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.760> idea<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.840> lose

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
fat from my lower abs and I think that's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
fat from my lower abs and I think that's
the<00:00:47.820> biggest<00:00:48.059> problem<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:49.200> guys<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.829> girls

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the biggest problem that guys and girls

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
the biggest problem that guys and girls
have<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.850> an<00:00:51.120> area<00:00:51.660> where<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> store

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
have it's just an area where you store

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.369 
have it's just an area where you store
fat<00:00:52.260> naturally<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.670> usually<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.570> area

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
fat naturally and it's usually the area

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.840 
fat naturally and it's usually the area
of<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:55.559> body<00:00:55.770> where<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> fat<00:00:56.309> comes<00:00:56.670> off

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of your body where the fat comes off

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
of your body where the fat comes off
last<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> people<00:00:58.530> think

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
last and I think a lot of people think

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
last and I think a lot of people think
this<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> fitness<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> supplement

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
this because the fitness and supplement

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.369 
this because the fitness and supplement
industry<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.680> based<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:03.199> misconception<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
industry is based on misconception and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.920 
industry is based on misconception and
confusing<00:01:05.070> people<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.700> tricking<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.360> into

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
confusing people and tricking them into

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
confusing people and tricking them into
buying<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.680> thinking<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.490> will

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
buying one thing thinking that they will

get<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.409> gripe<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
get this it's just a little gripe that I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.770 
get this it's just a little gripe that I
have<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> industry<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.299> really

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
fat at the same rate so let's take a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.119 
fat at the same rate so let's take a
person<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.440> overweight

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
person that is really really overweight

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.009 
person that is really really overweight
and<00:02:41.370> they<00:02:41.760> go<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> diet<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.599> exercise

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and they go on a diet and exercise

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.449 
and they go on a diet and exercise
program<00:02:43.200> they're<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.099> lose<00:02:44.250> weight

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
program they're going to lose weight

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.910 
program they're going to lose weight
really<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.569> quickly<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.379> after<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> while

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
really really quickly but after a while

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.160 
really really quickly but after a while
what<00:02:47.220> happens<00:02:47.609> their<00:02:48.090> weight<00:02:48.329> loss<00:02:48.359> kind<00:02:49.049> of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
what happens their weight loss kind of

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.589 
what happens their weight loss kind of
slows<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.280> plateaus<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.760> little<00:02:51.120> bit<00:02:51.269> so

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
slows and it plateaus a little bit so

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.759 
slows and it plateaus a little bit so
when<00:02:51.750> you're<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.079> part<00:02:52.319> when<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:52.590> kind

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
when you're at the part when it's kind

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
of plateauing the only thing that you

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.559 
of plateauing the only thing that you
can<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.170> persevere<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.730> keep<00:02:56.909> going<00:02:57.329> stay
