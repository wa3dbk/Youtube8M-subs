00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.929

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.089
 new video i'm boss you put yourself and how 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 always at least I hope 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:27.779
 they try to make you hear a day today vi 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.279
 I show a sit it a ping ping and ve 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 I show it to this world 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.100
 really where this island is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 floating in the bent and much and say 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 this map I don't know you might like 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.579
 because it is strange and above all because it is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 strange in making us build a house 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.230
 or make us a series or make us 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.010
 something of the same, however, excuse me 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.749
 I move on much less ok 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.360
 yes in short, that might like this 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:11.509
 map because it is strange and initially there 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.509
 lager at a casino mainly because 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.619
 waited a moment there is serious like 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.619
 said then 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:30.729
 friend graden where you are 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.110
 in short, there is serious here it is 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.180
 in a while, heel is definitely already 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.009
 started to go down and in a while it will come down 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.310
 also from here 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.220
 as you can see, it will begin to split 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.750
 serious and these are the first moments of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.520
 lag but wow wow 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.759
 in short, so if you work them and you are 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.310
 like playing in survival you don't 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.429
 I recommend staying below 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.299
 because really a death trap e 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:08.170
 it is truly a gigantic whole island 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:12.400
 that flies in the sky but is also full of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.540
 trees so I don't know if it dies 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.860
 just immersed this is it ever 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.610
 really effective wow oh wow oh wow 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.170
 ok one thing that I tried to 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.470
 this map is this mainly a 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.390
 moment, however, field no 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.790
 ok but you split or legs at the end 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 you are a survival file so do n't give it to him 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.560
 advice to do it go go unless 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.299
 don't take a trampoline that takes you to 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.400
 part a little deep 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.010
 so guys I hope the video is there 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.250
 especially liked that the city ​​is 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.010

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.799
