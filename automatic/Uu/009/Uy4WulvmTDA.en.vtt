are we getting remote okay okay setting
see<00:02:37.380> how<00:02:37.440> far<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.680> get

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:24.800 

all<00:02:53.110> right<00:02:53.230> we're<00:02:53.350> gonna<00:02:53.440> set<00:02:53.680> up<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.860> French

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.150 

well<00:03:25.810> remember<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> range<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.800> gonna<00:03:26.980> be

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
well remember the range is gonna be

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.100 
well remember the range is gonna be
higher<00:03:27.340> than<00:03:27.730> what<00:03:28.120> I'm<00:03:28.330> showing<00:03:28.570> here<00:03:28.720> when

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
higher than what I'm showing here when

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.690 
higher than what I'm showing here when
the<00:03:29.230> receiver<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.770> actually<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> air<00:03:30.520> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
the receiver is actually in the air and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.660 
the receiver is actually in the air and
flying<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.270> not<00:03:31.630> in<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.960> cam<00:03:32.550> but<00:03:33.550> the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
flying and not in the cam but the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.970 
flying and not in the cam but the
difference<00:03:34.000> between<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.540> USA<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.200> France<00:03:35.530> is

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
difference between the USA and France is

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.230 
difference between the USA and France is
43<00:03:36.910> feet<00:03:37.240> line<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.320> sight<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:39.030> USA<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
43 feet line of sight and the USA and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.660 
43 feet line of sight and the USA and
the<00:03:40.600> United<00:03:40.930> Kingdom<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.470> only<00:03:41.710> 31<00:03:42.430> feet

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
the United Kingdom is only 31 feet

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.850 
the United Kingdom is only 31 feet
difference<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.930> all<00:03:44.110> flat<00:03:44.380> on<00:03:44.740> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
difference and this is all flat on the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.580 
difference and this is all flat on the
ground<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.490> camp<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.870> even<00:03:47.260> though<00:03:47.380> that's

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
ground in the camp so even though that's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.070 
ground in the camp so even though that's
negligible<00:03:48.520> Jeff<00:03:49.030> asked<00:03:49.360> me<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.630> question

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
negligible Jeff asked me the question

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.630 
negligible Jeff asked me the question
for<00:03:50.320> which<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.620> really<00:03:50.890> don't<00:03:51.100> have<00:03:51.220> an<00:03:51.459> answer

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
for which I really don't have an answer

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.710 
for which I really don't have an answer
and<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.260> why<00:03:54.040> would<00:03:54.850> they<00:03:55.060> put<00:03:55.420> these

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and that is why would they put these

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.780 
and that is why would they put these
power<00:03:56.110> limits<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.920> transmitter<00:03:57.550> and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
power limits in the transmitter and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.420 
power limits in the transmitter and
there's<00:03:57.970> such<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> little<00:03:58.540> difference<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.590> why

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
there's such a little difference and why

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.340 
speed control but I'm not worried about
that<00:04:44.180> okay<00:04:45.180> here's<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.480> few<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
that okay here's a few of the

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.260 
that okay here's a few of the
temperature<00:04:46.950> readings<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.760> test<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
temperature readings to test the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.190 
temperature readings to test the
temperature<00:04:48.450> sensor<00:04:49.110> before<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.620> test<00:04:49.890> and

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
temperature sensor before the test and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.690 
temperature sensor before the test and
you<00:04:52.200> can<00:04:52.380> see<00:04:52.590> for<00:04:52.770> yourself<00:04:53.190> how<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.400> works

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
you can see for yourself how it works

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.330 
you can see for yourself how it works
the<00:04:54.450> point<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:55.230> have<00:04:55.350> an<00:04:55.530> idea<00:04:55.950> don't

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
the point is if you have an idea don't

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.940 
the point is if you have an idea don't
be<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.880> soon<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.360> dismiss<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.050> because<00:04:58.260> if<00:04:58.770> it

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
be so soon to dismiss it because if it

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.580 
be so soon to dismiss it because if it
sounds<00:04:59.250> stupid<00:04:59.460> on<00:04:59.760> paper<00:05:00.060> but<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.140> works<00:05:01.380> in

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
sounds stupid on paper but it works in

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.280 
sounds stupid on paper but it works in
real<00:05:01.830> life<00:05:02.570> it<00:05:03.570> ain't<00:05:03.690> stupid

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
real life it ain't stupid

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.850 
real life it ain't stupid
I<00:05:04.940> ran<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.060> motor<00:05:06.300> on<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.660> 3<00:05:06.900> amp<00:05:07.110> battery<00:05:07.620> for

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
I ran the motor on the 3 amp battery for

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.670 
I ran the motor on the 3 amp battery for
15<00:05:08.310> minutes<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:08.970> here's<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.570> readings<00:05:09.990> just

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
15 minutes and here's the readings just

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.620 
15 minutes and here's the readings just
before<00:05:11.010> starting<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.970> results<00:05:12.450> after

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
before starting and the results after

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:56.300 
before starting and the results after
the<00:05:12.930> run

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.560 

while<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.580> can<00:05:57.790> see<00:05:58.000> this<00:05:58.210> switch

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
while you can see this switch

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.670 
while you can see this switch
temperatures<00:05:59.110> can<00:05:59.200> go<00:05:59.380> up<00:05:59.500> at<00:05:59.620> all<00:06:01.350> not<00:06:02.350> even

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
temperatures can go up at all not even

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.530 
temperatures can go up at all not even
the<00:06:03.130> slightest<00:06:03.700> bit<00:06:03.790> warm<00:06:04.360> batteries<00:06:05.260> are<00:06:05.440> one

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
the slightest bit warm batteries are one

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.860 
the slightest bit warm batteries are one
that's<00:06:07.540> it<00:06:08.220> not<00:06:09.220> gonna<00:06:09.370> hurt<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.690> so<00:06:10.690> here's

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
that's it not gonna hurt that so here's

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.020 
that's it not gonna hurt that so here's
my<00:06:11.020> conclusion<00:06:11.230> the<00:06:11.860> 5-amp<00:06:12.340> switch<00:06:12.640> which

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
my conclusion the 5-amp switch which

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.060 
my conclusion the 5-amp switch which
i've<00:06:13.240> jumper<00:06:13.630> to<00:06:13.750> make<00:06:13.900> 10<00:06:14.170> amps<00:06:14.530> works<00:06:14.740> just

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
i've jumper to make 10 amps works just

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.010 
i've jumper to make 10 amps works just
fine<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.610> with<00:06:15.790> no<00:06:15.940> increased<00:06:16.390> in<00:06:16.600> evil
