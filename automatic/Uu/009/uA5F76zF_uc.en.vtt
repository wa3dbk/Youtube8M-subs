 How you've participated the event will meet us using the three-digit number 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.220
 0 0 0 to 999 1 / 1000th of violence 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:46.040
 It's a little rarer, but I have to do something like this . 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.690
 Oh, I 'll still do it. The three digits 1 will go yesterday . Three weeks until June 25th . 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.700
 I'll do it by Thursday. 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.270
 I made a presentation on Thursday 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.719
 I will send it out on June 30th of next month 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.070
 You can take a three - digit number and write it down. 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.030
 I still have a passion for turning me over. 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.750
 Amada On February 25th, cancer will be broadcast live, and if not, 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.780
 It is. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.620
 I came because there no one who deliberately and matchwojugo 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.280
 I have a card like this, but it comes here 0 9 8 7 6 4 3 et 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.489
 I did. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.650
 I am passionate film and place in random mix 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.650
 Departure rattling first place 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.360
 If you have two such up-and- coming pockets, this is the case . 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.930
 As the first self zest seven times 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:43.709
 I will go back to Zohun 7 again. 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:49.470
 It's the second time. You know what I 'm doing. 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:54.599
 4 off the last time 47 cows kkuyeok go back again once the world's very ppok 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:00.239
 The number 4 is the number of the last sag that is good . 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:05.310
 So if this happens, the person who wrote 47 04 7 will be the winner. 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:10.650
 If the word getjiyo 16 04 7 people are reading is difficult for example, 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:16.319
 If 16 of those numbers do not work too much, 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.340
 If it works hand-over if the one who wrote soon send 16 against the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.060
 It's off. 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.380
 Then, if it is not 16 , it will become a case. 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.190
 This is not just getting the number 16 is just above the 04 words Ã‚ 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.359
 Because 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.010
 048 I make a selection from there . 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:38.010
 So this time, and from 1 046 in front of the ball dead 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.750
 I do not have any. 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.170
 I will go out next week when I come to Lotto . 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.700
 Are you awesome challenge at a time of party control 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.930
 047 If you came , then 048, then 0, then 049 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:00.600
 And then, 045 something like this, I picked up some 16 minutes. 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.740
 If you selected the same burner, of course those who wrote first on YouTube 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.820
 If you see 2 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.990
 It 's not a popular comment level, because if you sort by time, you can catch it. 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:14.070
 Of course, if you look at it, it's an attack. 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.820
 If you do a little trick to get me to do something that would happen should the vote 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:22.110
 I think there are those who have received it in numbers or not . 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.860
 If you see this on YouTube, if you edit this comment, it will be marked as modified. 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.790
 It's possible 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.010
 So, I guess that makes sense. If you make a comment, 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.490
 It's missing . 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.480
 Of course, even if you use it more than once more than once, the old one is eliminated. 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.830
 I mean doeguyo us just ran only once in the comments if the number in the next 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.910
 Then I want to change prices, delete the existing bone to go all the Crown Prince at the age Comments 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.800
 You can put it. 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.790
 If you are a good person and your grandfather or ancestor should come up, 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.930
 Sounds good. 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.380
 Uh This is why I like him more often once nephew would last for 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.980
 There are a lot of mothers who nurse our nephews when they eat. 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.030
 Do not tell pulled by magnetic For deuryeoyo 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.630
 n Information If the sun just hurts motivation amounts should seek better you'll look just for fun 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.770
 I think. 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:12.270
 Thank you for saving so much, and I have not been able to do any event in the near future. 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.830
 What events are you going to do often figured as if you were hiding inside an existing video 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.540
 I just did it last time . 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.760
 I think I will. I will tell you now. 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.570
 The debt is a little short. 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.140
 Then, of course, everything is subsidized, so I thought it was fun. 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.370
 Just an event point and 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:35.220
 I recommend us just write down what wants to think long the freeze some nice spring 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.850
 It may be nice to wait, but you should write it down as soon as possible . 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.560
 It's the same. 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.090
 Oh, this generously once every boot, including 12 that what 6 since 16 kkigi 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.430
 I could not live to ask. 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.960
 If the 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:53.000
 As before, 04 is not 7, but if the construction company came out, it is 9 people. 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:57.290
 From the first to the 9th minute, it is the pink most days 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.650
 But seems good but give you the option hanteneun torture hanteneun the rest of you 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:06.170
 I would appreciate your understanding of the advantage of being sent at random 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:11.810
 It's 28th today, so it's only a week until the 25th. 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:15.080
 Oh, the next day , I announce the 25th, and I'll win the winner by the 26th. 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.230
 Winner comes send and receive mail with information to come 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.250
 I will send it out on June 30th. 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:26.090
 The same water is a little more difficult to get and get, 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.470
 If you look at the internet, it 's very similar to your qualifications. 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.090
 I hope you get it. 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:36.410

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.690
