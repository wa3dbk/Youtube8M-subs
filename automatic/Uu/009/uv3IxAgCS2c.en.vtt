00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
want to do initially is I want to create

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
want to do initially is I want to create
a<00:00:19.170> very<00:00:19.439> light<00:00:19.740> cup<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.279> bottom<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> this

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
a very light cup on the bottom of this

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.330 
a very light cup on the bottom of this
thing<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.600> when<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:21.930> done<00:00:22.140> turning<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> out

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
thing so when we get done turning it out

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
thing so when we get done turning it out
they'll<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.880> will<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.390> small<00:00:24.660> concave

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
they'll have will be a small concave

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.769 
they'll have will be a small concave
there<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.970> ever<00:00:27.119> swells<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.660> anything

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
there so if it ever swells or anything

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
there so if it ever swells or anything
only<00:00:27.930> wobble<00:00:28.500> it'll<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.740> sitting<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> ring

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
only wobble it'll be sitting on a ring

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.339 
only wobble it'll be sitting on a ring
so<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
I'm just going to do this by hand so I'm

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
I'm just going to do this by hand so I'm
going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> drop<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.200> blank<00:00:34.620> into<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.239> now

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
this whole process can be done just by

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.940 
this whole process can be done just by
turning<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.329> thing<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.770> your

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
cup in here and I just run a little bit

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.440 
cup in here and I just run a little bit
of<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.219> test<00:01:38.429> here<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.880> how<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.209> sitting

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of a test here to see how it's sitting

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260 
of a test here to see how it's sitting
on<00:01:39.569> that<00:01:39.750> Center<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.319> looks<00:01:40.499> good<00:01:40.709> so<00:01:41.270> some

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
on that Center and it looks good so some

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.669 
on that Center and it looks good so some
people<00:01:42.420> might<00:01:42.719> not<00:01:42.869> feel<00:01:43.049> comfortable<00:01:43.259> doing

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
people might not feel comfortable doing

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:44.029 
people might not feel comfortable doing
this

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
this

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.160 
this
now<00:01:44.219> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.609> just<00:01:44.880> screw<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> piece<00:01:45.179> like<00:01:46.109> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now you can just screw a piece like a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.319 
now you can just screw a piece like a
you<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.039> big<00:01:47.369> stick<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.849> it<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.030> turn<00:01:48.209> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you know a big stick to it and turn it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.880 
you know a big stick to it and turn it
all<00:01:48.450> by<00:01:48.630> hand<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.560> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
all by hand and it's you know it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.999 
all by hand and it's you know it's
doable<00:01:50.219> it's<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> slower<00:01:50.939> process<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:52.009> if

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
doable it's just a slower process and if

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.469 
doable it's just a slower process and if
you<00:01:53.159> guys<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.490> seen<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.789> other<00:01:53.819> videos<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you guys have seen my other videos you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.809 
you guys have seen my other videos you
know<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.959> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> slower<00:01:55.469> processes<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
know I'm not in the slower processes so

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.819 
know I'm not in the slower processes so
I'm<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.959> to<00:01:58.020> stick<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.349> in<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.739> now

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
I'm just going to stick this in here now

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.889 
I'm just going to stick this in here now
this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.039> a<00:01:59.219> little<00:01:59.579> off-center<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.780> bit

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
this is a little off-center a little bit

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.209 
this is a little off-center a little bit
so<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.439> drill<00:02:01.649> wobbling<00:02:02.069> back

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
so you can see the drill wobbling back

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.499 
so you can see the drill wobbling back
and<00:02:02.250> forth<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:04.909> my<00:02:05.909> template<00:02:06.329> keeps

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and forth but my my template keeps

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.029 
and forth but my my template keeps
everything<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.709> just<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
everything going so I'm just going to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.069 
everything going so I'm just going to
turn<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.399> laid<00:02:08.579> up<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.910> small<00:02:09.329> increments<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
turn up laid up in small increments you

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.839 
turn up laid up in small increments you
know<00:02:10.170> 30<00:02:10.560> second<00:02:10.920> or<00:02:10.950> sixteenth<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.549> a<00:02:11.579> time

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
know 30 second or sixteenth at a time

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.330 
know 30 second or sixteenth at a time
and<00:02:12.090> keep<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.930> drill<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.739> that's

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and keep this drill going and that's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.770 
and keep this drill going and that's
going<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.610> carve<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.940> bottom<00:02:15.269> out<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.420> bring

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
going to carve the bottom out I bring
