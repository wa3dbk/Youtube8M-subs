00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
to call the movies some of these movies

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
to call the movies some of these movies
aren't<00:02:22.800> even<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.160> idea<00:02:23.489> Annabel<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.120> sure

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
aren't even on the idea Annabel I'm sure

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.180 
aren't even on the idea Annabel I'm sure
that<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.170> still<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:25.890> theory<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.099> I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
that that is still in theory as I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.040 
that that is still in theory as I
believe<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.270> not<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.569> DVD<00:02:27.870> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
believe but I know it's not on DVD and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.990 
believe but I know it's not on DVD and
that's<00:02:28.230> already<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.500> there<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.430> there's<00:02:29.819> some

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that's already on there so there's some

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.370 
that's already on there so there's some
movies<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.330> walk<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.690> here<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.080> they<00:02:31.200> won't

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
movies that walk on here but they won't

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.550 
movies that walk on here but they won't
be<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.590> high<00:02:31.709> quality<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.370> i<00:02:32.580> would<00:02:33.390> watch<00:02:33.630> any

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
be in high quality so i would watch any

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.220 
be in high quality so i would watch any
of<00:02:34.650> these<00:02:34.800> movies<00:02:35.130> if<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:35.519> are<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.140> if<00:02:37.140> they

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
of these movies if they are in a if they

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.720 
of these movies if they are in a if they
have<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> high<00:02:37.680> quality<00:02:38.099> for<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.340> they're<00:02:38.489> if

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
have the high quality for if they're if

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.190 
have the high quality for if they're if
they<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.300> low<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.569> medium<00:02:39.690> it's

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
they just have a low and medium it's

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.870 
they just have a low and medium it's
probably<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.190> recording<00:02:41.790> quality

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
probably just like a recording quality

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.699 
probably just like a recording quality
won't<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.450> good<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:42.930> you're<00:02:43.319> gonna<00:02:43.500> watch
