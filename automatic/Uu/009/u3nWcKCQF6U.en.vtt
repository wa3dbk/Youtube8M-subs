00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.180
 hello that they are talking to them carlos 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.059
 let's continue with this course of 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.740
 cinema 4d in its version r-15 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.590
 in this chapter we are going to explain to you 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.110
 how to modify work pallets 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.119
 then you are like paintings or windows 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.199
 that we have here are palettes as we see 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.849
 in the previous chapter we had 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.009
 just the cee of command palettes 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.509
 what are these but not only are 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.460
 unique we have for example this one that is 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.230
 of perspective that we are also going to be able to 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.360
 see for example also in each of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.310
 its different dimensions is let's 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.490
 explain more details later also 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.460
 we have here this palette that basically 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.620
 our as a file explorer and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.390
 of layers here you're going to have just one 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.640
 of properties like this one here that 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.170
 we have our timeline ok every 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.810
 one of them for example this component 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.760
 of command I can get it out of this 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.680
 position and modify them according to my 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.630
 needs and how we are going to do it 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 basically we're going to go here where 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.870
 are our points we are going to click 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.610
 right and let's see what appears to us 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.470
 this context menu in which the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.450
 The first option we have is the sun 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.490
 class exceeds see here to unpack and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.659
 clearly we see that not and sends 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.609
 does it float 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.140
 since we have it here floating we see it 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.569
 again here to puntito of those 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.789
 little points we have again we're going 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.319
 we move it and let's see that when I 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.709
 I approach a point to a place 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:25.569
 it lights up this is telling me that I 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.640
 I can put a mint and I can put it 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.170
 vertically for example if the loose I'm going 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.649
 to see that I appear here again 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.270
 this line this command line 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.649
 just in this position for example 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.149
 I can do it again now with 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.750
 This will change will give 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:44.020
 to unpin I have it here floating if I 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.879
 I take it for the area let's say clear I do not 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.829
 will allow it to anchor I have to 

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.179
 do it in the dotted area only 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.950
 I'll be able to anchor it so I can 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.349
 anchor where I want let's see here 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.879
 because I was going to put it up here we go 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.590
 now I have it here as we see 

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.060
 they are automatically modifying me 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 my workspace I will 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.610
 can customize as much as I want 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.130
 yes 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.960
 Now, if I click again or 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.119
 take here the good know that you no longer 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.070
 It can be floating and I if I take it from 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.450
 the three points only the only thing that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.460
 I can do is change position 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
 but I can not be floating if the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.110
 I want floating again I have to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.660
 give it right click to unpin and then 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.210
 it will not be able to be floating ok 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.740
 normally its to put it here and as we have 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.360
 seen not only those paddles of 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.280
 commands with floating everything 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 have these squares with dotted 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.560
 here those little dots I will be able to 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.050
 to unfold and move where I please 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.390
 where I find it more convenient and 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.280
 now for example here, let's go 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.110
 to make a purse of things as we see 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.600
 here I will be able to change directly 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.400
 obviously because it does not suit me 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.410
 have it like that then what with the box in 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.150
 end as we have followed I have a whole 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.070
 mess because I lived I'm moving 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.050
 obviously the idea and we desordenamos 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.550
 is not going to make it customize now 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.080
 fine if after having moved everything 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.430
 this I made a mess here and I did not 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.770
 like how it was that I just 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.740
 I can go here again to window 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.810
 I go to environment 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.090
 and surroundings we see that here we have 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.860
 different environments already established the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.330
 what we have here is selected 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.540
 that boot environment when we give you 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.070
 here we are going to click again and what 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.680
 what it's going to be is that it's going to reestablish me 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.870
 to the boot environment with the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.660
 layout of all pallets 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.410
 say as we originally had 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.090
 obviously this is good because it is very 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.680
 useful so as not to make mistakes and 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.660
 also to be able to customize us 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.920
 directly in this tool 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.420
 window let's see that here is us 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.250
 we will be able to create not only is 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.560
 but we have some presets here 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.610
 of pre-set configurations of 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.870
 environment for example for animation for 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.390
 finally we have different tridents 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.100
 the standard a modeling mode let's say 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.170
 the visual light and we'll be 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.970
 explaining details we should know that 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.500
 for example the right contextual menu 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.760
 when we see click on the dots these 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.130
 we have not only the possibility of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.990
 anchor we have different options that 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.500
 we can load pallets save pallets 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.900
 we can change the name of the pallets 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.120
 change its orientation rename as 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.090
 we have mentioned folding pallets in order 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.170
 we have many options in say with 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 each of the pallets in such a way 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.670
 that we can customize and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.140
 if for example after having done 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.640
 all those modifications 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.200
 I want to save this environment 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.530
 I just go here environment and I put 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.690
 here where it says save environment as what 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.090
 click and obviously I'm going to 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.250
 save and I'm just going to assign it 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.420
 a name and that in this way prohibit 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.320
 or simply I'm going to save this 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.870
 environment and I will be able to load it 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.700
 again the moment would be all with 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.800
 regarding how to modify and customize 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.650
 the environment of the work area 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.270
 workspace and then invite 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.419
 actively this pulse and even the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.419
 next
