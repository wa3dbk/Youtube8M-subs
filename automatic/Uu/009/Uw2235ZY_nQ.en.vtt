00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.470 

so<00:00:01.740> basically<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.460> think<00:00:02.760> quano<00:00:03.090> has<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> little

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
so basically I think quano has a little

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.329 
so basically I think quano has a little
bit<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.689> an<00:00:03.780> edge<00:00:03.959> if<00:00:04.230> pure<00:00:04.830> can't<00:00:05.069> do<00:00:05.160> any

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
bit of an edge if pure can't do any

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.369 
bit of an edge if pure can't do any
damage<00:00:05.549> right<00:00:05.790> now<00:00:05.910> pure<00:00:06.390> does<00:00:06.660> have<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.170> High

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
damage right now pure does have to High

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.320 
damage right now pure does have to High
Templar<00:00:07.620> moving<00:00:08.099> out<00:00:08.220> though<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.910> he's<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
Templar moving out though so he's a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.330 
Templar moving out though so he's a
foregone<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> Dark<00:00:10.830> Templar<00:00:10.980> he's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
foregone going for a Dark Templar he's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.070 
foregone going for a Dark Templar he's
actually<00:00:11.490> gone<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:11.969> Street<00:00:12.210> High<00:00:12.540> Templar<00:00:12.750> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
actually gone for Street High Templar to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.259 
actually gone for Street High Templar to
deal<00:00:13.259> with<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:13.580> hydraulics<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> that's

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
deal with these hydraulics and that's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.400 
deal with these hydraulics and that's
going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.570> very<00:00:15.719> effective<00:00:15.990> against

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
going to be very effective against

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.960 
going to be very effective against
hydros<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.890> think<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.279> force<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.640> actually<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
hydros I think this force is actually a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.730 
hydros I think this force is actually a
little<00:00:18.029> too<00:00:18.180> small<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.990> wonder<00:00:19.500> where<00:00:19.590> he's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
little too small I wonder where he's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.260 
little too small I wonder where he's
pushing<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.250> soon<00:00:20.430> only<00:00:20.699> four<00:00:20.939> zealots

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
pushing out so soon only four zealots

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.700 
pushing out so soon only four zealots
that<00:00:21.300> protect<00:00:21.630> those<00:00:21.720> high<00:00:21.900> temperate<00:00:22.410> really

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that protect those high temperate really

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.640 
that protect those high temperate really
isn't<00:00:22.980> enough<00:00:24.050> okay<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.199> he's<00:00:25.350> got<00:00:25.500> more

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
isn't enough okay now he's got more

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
isn't enough okay now he's got more
zealots<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> quan<00:00:26.730> rose<00:00:26.910> note<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.240 
the second expansion of Quan rose they
might<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.350> pick<00:01:07.500> off<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> number<00:01:08.010> of

might be will pick off a number of

for Kwan row and drones pick it off

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.810 
for Kwan row and drones pick it off
actually<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.530> Kwan<00:02:20.800> row<00:02:20.980> i<00:02:21.010> think<00:02:21.280> maintaining

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
actually so Kwan row i think maintaining

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.300 
actually so Kwan row i think maintaining
his<00:02:21.910> lead<00:02:21.970> here<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:23.320> think<00:02:23.650> mainly<00:02:23.860> because<00:02:24.100> he

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
his lead here I think mainly because he

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
his lead here I think mainly because he

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
be focusing fire on the overlords but

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.970 
be focusing fire on the overlords but
looks<00:06:46.110> like<00:06:46.200> all<00:06:46.350> the<00:06:46.470> overlords<00:06:46.800> will

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
looks like all the overlords will

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.680 
looks like all the overlords will
survive<00:06:47.280> to<00:06:47.490> get<00:06:47.610> a<00:06:47.640> drop<00:06:47.880> down<00:06:48.120> on<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.390> back

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.600 
survive to get a drop down on the back
there<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.110> that<00:06:49.680> will<00:06:49.830> probably<00:06:49.860> spell<00:06:50.460> the

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
there and that will probably spell the

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.990 
there and that will probably spell the
doom<00:06:50.880> of<00:06:51.200> pure<00:06:52.520> actually<00:06:53.520> I<00:06:53.550> think<00:06:53.610> that<00:06:53.880> was<00:06:53.970> a

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
doom of pure actually I think that was a

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.490 
doom of pure actually I think that was a
faint<00:06:54.330> but<00:06:54.630> believe<00:06:54.900> it<00:06:55.020> or<00:06:55.080> not<00:06:55.260> I<00:06:55.320> don't

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
faint but believe it or not I don't

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.110 
faint but believe it or not I don't
think<00:06:55.830> those<00:06:55.980> words<00:06:56.760> are<00:06:56.820> filled<00:06:57.060> with
