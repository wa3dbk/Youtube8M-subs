in this video I'm going to reveal my top
four<00:00:07.049> players<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.529> avoid<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.040> your<00:00:08.160> team<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
four players to avoid in your team to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.370 
four players to avoid in your team to
start<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.090> season<00:00:09.480> there<00:00:10.139> are<00:00:10.200> four

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
start with this season there are four

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.169 
start with this season there are four
players<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.950> quite<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> high<00:00:11.490> ownership<00:00:11.880> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
players with quite a high ownership and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.820 
players with quite a high ownership and
I'm<00:00:12.540> seeing<00:00:12.780> them<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> lot<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> teams<00:00:13.679> that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I'm seeing them in a lot of teams that

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.470 
I'm seeing them in a lot of teams that
people<00:00:14.190> post<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.150> there<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.360> better

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
people post but I think there are better

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.939 
people post but I think there are better
options<00:00:15.660> out<00:00:16.080> there<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> thought<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.890> would

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
options out there so I thought I would

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.910 
options out there so I thought I would
explain<00:00:17.430> exactly<00:00:17.940> why<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.779> video<00:00:18.990> first

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
explain exactly why in this video first

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700 
explain exactly why in this video first
up<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.279> Phil<00:00:20.550> Jagielka<00:00:20.810> he's<00:00:21.810> owned<00:00:22.050> by<00:00:22.350> around

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
up is Phil Jagielka he's owned by around

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.130 
up is Phil Jagielka he's owned by around
twenty<00:00:23.160> six<00:00:23.400> percent<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.880> managers<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
twenty six percent of managers but that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.720 
twenty six percent of managers but that
slightly<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.650> because<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.099> his<00:00:26.220> four<00:00:26.430> goals

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
slightly to be because of his four goals

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
slightly to be because of his four goals
last<00:00:26.970> season<00:00:27.119> 10<00:00:28.050> clean<00:00:28.289> sheets<00:00:28.529> alone<00:00:28.859> isn't

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
last season 10 clean sheets alone isn't

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.830 
last season 10 clean sheets alone isn't
really<00:00:29.460> enough<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> player<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.420> his<00:00:30.570> price

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
really enough for a player in his price

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.130 
really enough for a player in his price
range<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.710> look<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:32.099> his<00:00:32.279> underlying<00:00:32.700> stats

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
range but a look at his underlying stats

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
range but a look at his underlying stats
15<00:00:34.140> total<00:00:34.410> shots<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.280> only<00:00:35.579> two<00:00:35.820> chances

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
15 total shots and only two chances

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
15 total shots and only two chances
created<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.840> total<00:00:37.200> demonstrates<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.190> it's

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
created in total demonstrates that it's

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.160 
created in total demonstrates that it's
unlikely<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.940> jagielka<00:00:39.570> will<00:00:39.719> keep<00:00:39.960> gaining

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
unlikely that jagielka will keep gaining

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
unlikely that jagielka will keep gaining
attacking<00:00:40.590> returns<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> same<00:00:41.879> level

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
attacking returns at that same level

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.840 
attacking returns at that same level
because<00:00:42.690> four<00:00:42.899> goals<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.410> only<00:00:43.710> 15<00:00:44.129> shots<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
because four goals from only 15 shots is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.080 
because four goals from only 15 shots is
an<00:00:45.030> incredibly<00:00:45.510> high<00:00:45.719> conversion<00:00:46.260> rate<00:00:46.440> also

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
an incredibly high conversion rate also

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.340 
an incredibly high conversion rate also
Everton<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> worst<00:00:48.809> starts<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Everton have one of the worst starts to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290 
Everton have one of the worst starts to
the<00:00:49.440> season<00:00:49.469> imaginable<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.640> terms<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> their

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the season imaginable in terms of their

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
the season imaginable in terms of their

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
opening fixtures game wheat one looks

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
opening fixtures game wheat one looks
good<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.870> face

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
good for them but then they face

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
good for them but then they face
Southampton<00:00:55.469> man<00:00:56.250> city<00:00:56.550> spurs<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.480> chelsea

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Southampton man city spurs and chelsea

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.139 
Southampton man city spurs and chelsea
in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.530> next<00:00:58.800> four<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> end

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
in the next four and that's not the end

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.849 
in the next four and that's not the end
of<00:01:00.300> their<00:01:00.420> poor<00:01:00.629> fixtures<00:01:01.050> either<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of their poor fixtures either in the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
of their poor fixtures either in the
following<00:01:02.280> five<00:01:02.460> games<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:03.359> face<00:01:03.570> Liverpool

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
following five games they face Liverpool

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.340 
following five games they face Liverpool
United<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> Arsenal<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.670> back-to-back<00:01:06.299> games

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
United and Arsenal in back-to-back games

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.149 
United and Arsenal in back-to-back games
so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> those

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so I don't like the look of those

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.950 
so I don't like the look of those
fixtures<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.090> don't<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.479> much<00:01:09.600> potential

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
fixtures and I don't see much potential

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
fixtures and I don't see much potential
for<00:01:10.170> clean<00:01:10.409> sheets<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.760> think

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
for clean sheets and I also don't think

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
for clean sheets and I also don't think
that<00:01:12.030> Jaguar<00:01:12.510> cuz<00:01:12.659> attacking<00:01:13.110> returns<00:01:13.409> will

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that Jaguar cuz attacking returns will

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.620 
that Jaguar cuz attacking returns will
continue<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.729> taking<00:01:15.090> such<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> small

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
continue with in taking such a small

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.179 
continue with in taking such a small
amount<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> shots<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> creating<00:01:16.799> hardly<00:01:17.070> any

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
amount of shots and creating hardly any

amount of shots and creating hardly any
chances<00:01:17.840> next<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.110> Nathaniel<00:01:19.680> Clyne<00:01:19.860> quite

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
chances next up is Nathaniel Clyne quite

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
chances next up is Nathaniel Clyne quite

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
boils down to for me is that he's more
expensive<00:01:41.430> than<00:01:41.520> last<00:01:41.729> season<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> he's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
expensive than last season and he's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
expensive than last season and he's
playing<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> defense<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.649> tends<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> keep

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
playing in a defense that tends to keep

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
playing in a defense that tends to keep
fewer<00:01:44.579> clean<00:01:44.820> sheets<00:01:45.090> than<00:01:45.270> his<00:01:45.390> previous

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
fewer clean sheets than his previous

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
fewer clean sheets than his previous
club<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.829> he's<00:01:46.920> great<00:01:47.070> value

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
club so I don't think he's great value

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
club so I don't think he's great value
all<00:01:47.750> his<00:01:48.750> opening<00:01:49.140> fixtures<00:01:49.470> don't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
all his opening fixtures don't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.679 
all his opening fixtures don't
particularly<00:01:50.009> tempt<00:01:50.430> me<00:01:50.549> either<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.420> away

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
particularly tempt me either with away

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
particularly tempt me either with away

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
to come in the first five game weeks so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.740 
to come in the first five game weeks so
again<00:01:56.490> client<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.509> avoid

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
again client is one that I would avoid

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
again client is one that I would avoid

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to begin with next up is Petter check

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
to begin with next up is Petter check
but<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.290> point<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.799> covers<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
but really this point also covers the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.459 
but really this point also covers the
other<00:02:02.610> premium<00:02:02.939> goalkeepers<00:02:03.600> available<00:02:04.049> such

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
other premium goalkeepers available such

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.859 
other premium goalkeepers available such
as<00:02:04.530> Courtois<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.340> Joe<00:02:05.640> Hart<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.570> denying

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
as Courtois or Joe Hart I'm not denying

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.690 
as Courtois or Joe Hart I'm not denying
that<00:02:06.930> check<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> fantastic<00:02:07.799> keeper<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.550> is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that check is a fantastic keeper he is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
that check is a fantastic keeper he is
he's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> great<00:02:09.539> signing<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.020> Arsenal<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
he's a great signing for Arsenal and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
he's a great signing for Arsenal and
will<00:02:11.069> surely<00:02:11.520> boost<00:02:11.700> their<00:02:11.940> chances<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
will surely boost their chances of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
will surely boost their chances of
keeping<00:02:12.629> clean<00:02:13.020> sheets

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
keeping clean sheets

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.200 
keeping clean sheets
but<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> tend<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> find<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
but what I tend to find is that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.480 
but what I tend to find is that
goalkeepers<00:02:15.960> from<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> top<00:02:16.530> teams<00:02:16.770> tend<00:02:17.340> to

goalkeepers from the top teams tend to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.400 
goalkeepers from the top teams tend to
make<00:02:17.670> less<00:02:17.940> saves<00:02:18.240> by<00:02:18.480> far<00:02:18.810> than<00:02:19.260> the

make less saves by far than the

make less saves by far than the

Courtois<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.330> as<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.900> see<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.230> made

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
Courtois and as you can see they made

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.949 
Courtois and as you can see they made
much<00:02:46.620> less<00:02:46.860> safe<00:02:47.100> than<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.370> others<00:02:47.670> only<00:02:48.090> 87

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
for hot and 75 for courtois that means

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690 
for hot and 75 for courtois that means
that<00:02:51.600> Fabianski<00:02:52.260> made<00:02:52.440> an<00:02:52.590> additional<00:02:53.040> 62

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that Fabianski made an additional 62

that Fabianski made an additional 62
saves<00:02:54.000> compared<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.050> courtois<00:02:55.440> made<00:02:55.680> now

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.680 
saves compared to what courtois made now
the<00:02:56.400> other<00:02:56.580> main<00:02:56.850> thing<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.060> consider<00:02:57.360> with

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the other main thing to consider with

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.750 
the other main thing to consider with
goalkeepers<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.950> course<00:02:59.130> clean<00:02:59.459> sheets

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
goalkeepers is of course clean sheets

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.790 
goalkeepers is of course clean sheets
but<00:03:00.480> interestingly<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.320> not<00:03:01.530> always<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
but interestingly it's not always the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.650 
but interestingly it's not always the
top<00:03:02.100> table<00:03:02.340> teams<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.910> keep<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> most<00:03:03.420> clean

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
top table teams that keep the most clean

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.020 
top table teams that keep the most clean
sheets<00:03:03.930> plenty<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.010> mid<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> low<00:03:05.459> table<00:03:05.820> teams

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
sheets plenty of mid to low table teams

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.120 
sheets plenty of mid to low table teams
keep<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:06.930> many<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.260> not<00:03:07.470> more<00:03:07.680> clean

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
keep just as many if not more clean

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.790 
keep just as many if not more clean
sheets<00:03:08.370> last<00:03:09.030> season<00:03:09.390> West<00:03:09.660> Brom<00:03:09.930> managed<00:03:10.290> 16

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
sheets last season West Brom managed 16

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.790 
sheets last season West Brom managed 16
clean<00:03:11.070> sheets<00:03:11.420> Southampton<00:03:12.420> 15<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.380> also

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
clean sheets Southampton 15 and also

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800 
clean sheets Southampton 15 and also
they<00:03:14.220> didn't<00:03:14.459> make<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.640> top<00:03:14.790> 5<00:03:15.060> here<00:03:15.420> but

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
they didn't make the top 5 here but

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.270 
they didn't make the top 5 here but
Sunderland<00:03:16.200> managed<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.830> team<00:03:17.040> clean

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
Sunderland managed to the team clean

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.490 
Sunderland managed to the team clean
sheets<00:03:17.550> which<00:03:18.090> was<00:03:18.269> more<00:03:18.510> than<00:03:18.690> Arsenal's<00:03:19.200> 12

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
sheets which was more than Arsenal's 12

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500 
sheets which was more than Arsenal's 12
clean<00:03:19.739> sheets<00:03:19.980> last<00:03:20.160> season<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> think<00:03:21.239> it's

clean sheets last season so I think it's
always<00:03:21.660> best<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.080> use<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:22.440> goalkeeper<00:03:22.620> spot

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
always best to use your goalkeeper spot

always best to use your goalkeeper spot
for<00:03:23.340> someone<00:03:23.700> from<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:24.000> mid<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.420> low<00:03:24.540> table<00:03:24.959> side

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
getting clean sheets but also looks

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.350 
getting clean sheets but also looks
likely<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.070> make<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> lot<00:03:29.519> more<00:03:29.670> saves<00:03:30.000> than<00:03:30.239> the

chances created from 24 appearances he's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.180 
chances created from 24 appearances he's
currently<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.140> doubt<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.680> opening<00:04:08.010> game

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
currently a doubt for the opening game

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.340 
currently a doubt for the opening game
but<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:08.790> he<00:04:08.910> plays<00:04:09.150> like<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.900> say<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.079> would

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
but if he plays like I say I would

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.900 
but if he plays like I say I would
expect<00:04:10.620> him<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.950> come<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.310> at<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.459> center<00:04:11.880> of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
expect him to come in at the center of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.090 
expect him to come in at the center of
midfield<00:04:12.150> providing<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.230> bilasa<00:04:13.739> makes<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
midfield providing the bilasa makes the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.280 
midfield providing the bilasa makes the
game<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.519> he's<00:04:14.700> also<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:15.030> doubt<00:04:15.329> when<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.140> look

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
game but he's also a doubt when you look

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.690 
game but he's also a doubt when you look
at<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.470> other<00:04:16.620> prospects<00:04:17.130> from<00:04:17.280> Crystal

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
at the other prospects from Crystal

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.060 
at the other prospects from Crystal
Palace<00:04:18.000> but<00:04:18.510> like<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.900> Blassie<00:04:19.470> who's<00:04:19.919> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
Palace but like the Blassie who's the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
Palace but like the Blassie who's the
same<00:04:20.310> price<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.850> playing<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> wing<00:04:21.750> and

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
even punch um who may be played in the

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.320 
even punch um who may be played in the

hole behind the straw

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.600 
hole behind the straw
or<00:04:27.870> potentially<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> wing<00:04:28.860> it's<00:04:29.340> all

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
or potentially on the wing it's all

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.219 
or potentially on the wing it's all
hydrops<00:04:30.030> out<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.389> enable<00:04:30.780> them<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.960> play<00:04:31.199> a

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
hydrops out to enable them to play a

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.320 
hydrops out to enable them to play a
second<00:04:31.710> striker<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.490> punch<00:04:32.759> shot<00:04:32.879> is<00:04:33.060> not

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
second striker and punch shot is not

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.730 
second striker and punch shot is not
point<00:04:33.539> five<00:04:33.689> million<00:04:33.960> cheaper<00:04:34.349> than<00:04:34.470> goodbye

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
point five million cheaper than goodbye

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.010 
point five million cheaper than goodbye
so<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.340> would<00:04:35.669> up<00:04:35.759> for<00:04:35.939> him<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.479> Palace<00:04:36.810> cover

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
so I would up for him for Palace cover

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.230 
so I would up for him for Palace cover
for<00:04:37.259> now<00:04:37.409> if<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:38.189> becomes<00:04:38.460> clear<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:38.849> could

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
for now if it becomes clear that could

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.700 
for now if it becomes clear that could
buy<00:04:39.360> will<00:04:39.599> actually<00:04:39.900> play<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.379> a<00:04:40.469> more

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
buy will actually play in a more

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.619 
buy will actually play in a more
attacking<00:04:40.979> position<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:42.090> i<00:04:42.120> may<00:04:42.330> change<00:04:42.360> my
