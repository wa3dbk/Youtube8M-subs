00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.000
 buy all sorts of large prints of one hour for the other parties 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.130
 errors in too large a foot and a lot of work 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.610
 the consumer association tested large format footprints on different ones 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.100
 materials in addition can only you can also have the protests printed in advance 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.079
 place is currently in eighth place 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.079
 what does that look like and expectation photos is the difference 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.949
 Nijkamp was what your photo printed on canvas 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.359
 and that will be the case at the back of the photo 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.060
 continues on the edge until you have a fact 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 product but you will be able to practice part of your legs, so you have to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.510
 note 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.040
 that's good for the wetering photo tells can fit he made must 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.460
 you are under the big names that you are going to do your sport normally 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.000
 some suppliers also leave broad margins under pressure 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.970
 chances are they are suitable for all types of photos and they come in all 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.070
 lighting conditions 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.100
 although sings a little bit in the canvas draws nicely for the color areas 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.480
 less errors in the photo 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.920
 well midkap was a good choice for starting photographers and photos that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 made with compact cameras 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 the overview with corners of which are extra vulnerable 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.050
 aluminum that let mouth consist of two thin layer is as a minimum with 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.100
 in between a nagar the arts place of three millimeters this is true and 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.240
 solid and also tough 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.729
 that works best to hang that won light Tuesday or indirectly 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.720
 the light is reflected too much 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.250
 He places higher demands on your photo because the intertek is not in the material 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560
 until the camp fishing was out of focus, making it much stronger 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.480
 on 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.970
 it's good to know that not all minima looks like you 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.980
 maybe would expect the material 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.870
 it's just like being on a white place 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.620
 a general but shale camp hotel at some providers also times 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.070
 brushed off aluminum that works especially well for black and white 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.400
 photos 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 if you put photo on art or or lecce then you get a hiding place 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.960
 the five or ten millimeters thick 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.350
 I later crossed his fingers a lot of shape 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.820
 materials are suitable for all types of photos but also here again a chance 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.140
 I like that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.750
 and especially dark photos suffer from that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.320
 and the prince and mat to lift up and sweating when hanging a little piece of the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.879
 man 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.019
 like shah in iran glass of water so plexiglass might be something for you 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.379
 photo is planned on the back of material this is not being talked about 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.540
 in terneuzen is transparent on a number of points but sometimes there is also one 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.549
 thickness of black extra protective layer of plastic on the back of plexiglass 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.549
 glass invoices gives you photo and livelier heroes and chic appearance 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.779
 the soir sturdy and the he was strong 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.609
 so don't use it for dark photos that really fall into the mirror 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.589
 the north 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:45.119
 also with a plexiglass are far below in the photos to sell and there one 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.119
 smash year only suitable for sharp photos with little noise 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.439
 for all photo band money, the best result was with well-exposed 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.319
 sharp photos of a sufficiently high resolution 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.469
 but the exact unfortunately not always everywhere as the test turned out to be a hefty one 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.719
 number of footprint storms speaks the father of the twenty-headed 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.499
 especially in dark photos of those strong on it never finds rule on the wall 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.829
 Luckily you don't see any speaking prohibitions on the top rated footprint 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.000
 some providers take photo pr sacrifice behind materials and that picks up 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.819
 good for image quality but it is not suitable for use in 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.619
 humid spaces 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.499
 these panel members ordered frits with one from all different providers 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.789
 own photo on it then assessed by three photographers and print quality 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:43.509
 there were really big differences between this rodriguez in the newspaper x de 4 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.269
 A solution is partly because of the it then you should see them at the front runners 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:52.850
 bond 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.009
 It is all the same photo that is printed well before 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.499
 that specific material 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.559
 what i am doing i am creating the photos answers on red colors 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.679
 contrast and brightness 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.849
 after what you see is that the differences are decent 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.579
 the throat lighter specimens between and some will accidentally 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.340
 these masts is just giving his face on the fiod what other effects and 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.809
 this this space 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:24.569
 however, it is noticeable that differences will be strong for this 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.050
 we also really like the first test 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.120
 by making a number of Christmas the material is taken to the grave with pepper 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.060
 pick up further from the ecb stays with most friendships 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.830
 fine with some tracks really my thing off the water 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 those plates that will also damage quickly with normal use 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.780
 mobistar is also great prize he easy you go to the competition 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:52.590
 of the shares in the red photo franc, a piece of information is immediately finished 

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:55.550
 with the card once again and again and a few days later it is not time 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.199
 km delivered from in stores 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.330
 the age differences formido from 3 to 9 working days his city was happy 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.849
