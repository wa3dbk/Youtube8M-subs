00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.480
 the cheapest coins and especially with 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.810
 the high buyer will arrive in two 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.810
 minutes 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.389
 against 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.609
 hello youtube welcome but my channel 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.929

 more and nothing less that reaches another 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.029
 chapter of the fei such other two parties 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.640
 more to try as you already know how to improve 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.050
 our team is a national tournament that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 can become international if it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.409
 we do well so between all of us are going to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.790
 try to build a team the best 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.500
 possible as we are doing and that already 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.269
 you are seeing that two weeks are now missing 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.970
 successes we got to the three already and 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.649
 you leave them there you have the two players 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.360
 that you have bet and that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.460
 you have voted with you like thanks to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.049
 everyone from heart to you are participating 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.269
 very much both the ifai such as 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.739
 all Spanish participants and 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.629
 true that this is appreciated since 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.129
 without you they are not giving way 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.049
 It would not do any good as we build another 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.610
 team and especially I have many 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.259
 desire to always play and share 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.030
 motorcycles to and bring the maximum coins 

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:04.799
 possible for me to mount is a team 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 like the one you are doing is me 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.450
 enchanting you and deciding the part 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 sergio ramos and hybrid boxes and 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 that from now on the right part 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.310
 is going to belong to the baby there the part 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.649
 left will belong to the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 bundesliga you decide and here we go 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.950
 to continue so I will try to remove the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.300
 possible good maximums to return to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.530
 improve this team you know you have 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.610
 down in the description all the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.110
 channels and it's all 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.550
 participants of the fatal wish you luck 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.440
 Its channels are people 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.180
 extraordinary so after saying 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.950
 all this we are going to look for rival already you know 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.810
 with the necessary rules and we mark a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 goal with the fatal 50 thousand coins if 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.790
 mark with another player 35000 if 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 remove 50 thousand if they mark us minus 35 thousand 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.120
 and so on consecutively I recommend you 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 see in the previous chapters if not 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.570
 you know very well how standards go like this 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.740
 let's come, let's go, kids, let's go 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.660
 look for our first rival and so 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 unless it is fully accessible and 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.110
 above all I will try to remove the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.510
 maximum coins to improve this great 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.190
 team that you are telling me 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.720
 good guys while you look at the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.000
 Our rival's team sincerely 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.440
 for me it was totally accessible and not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.060
 gave me when I saw that rival did not give me 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.590
 No fear I have to say yes 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.750
 that it is true that you yourselves boots 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.980
 is that if they want 2.0 this series and that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.690
 you liked the previous chapter and 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.010
 list very many likes I had a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.140
 failure of this game was not recording 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.420
 in 2.0 what happens that I neither capturing 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.370
 is external or is this part of the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.870
 computer and I could not give me a fault and I did not 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 there could be no way to recover the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.750
 audio in the video so I'm sorry 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.090
 a lot this time you're going to have to put up with 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.250
 or if I comment the game and give a thousand 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.290
 sensations and experiences and as you see 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 As soon as the game started, the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.650
 true pretty fast please for me 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
 plus a penalty he had already thrown twice 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.260
 it happens that you already know that they are two 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.600
 matches and I have to summarize it in what 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 maximum possible it is very difficult for me to bring 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.530
 many clips to summarize the game 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.240
 if who has more possession who 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.500
 has more possession but I 'm going here 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.959
 share the goals since there were 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.640
 enough in this game and there already 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.470
 we got our first 50,000 good 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.030
 of admission a penalty to royce and 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.100
 you know if we mark with the fight to 50 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.709
 thousand coins there you see that he took out the cheto 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.020
 center we took 35 thousand coins from him 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.820
 party was super on track and nothing 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.500
 more remove from the middle of the field you know 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.290
 aubameyang 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.060
 but my favorite and that is the standard 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.920
 This team is just going to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
 take it out again and again and it was continuous 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.610
 the party was quite in favor for 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.350
 I'm already in the second part you see 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.260
 that he wanted had way of not had 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.060
 way to stop this guy honestly 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.430
 is a player that if he does not prove it is in 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.380
 your life prove it is impressive 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.970
 impressive you are already seeing that I do not know 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.740
 again take out the tail and the good of 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.480
 match shot to the stick that I wanted to take 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.030
 the maximum possible currencies but already 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.620
 You 've seen enough of them as you can see 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.510
 first match the first goal of a 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.540
 player 35 thousand coins three goals 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.820
 our feitel player total a total of 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.650
 185 thousand coins, 185 thousand coins 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.690
 in the first game of drawn more than 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.459
 in all the previous chapters that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.370
 have thought I wanted to go for a 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.320
 player 'top' once you see that you take 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 185 thousand coins you come up and if you 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.140
 you find another rival of the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.540
 Dutch let's see it to the gods and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.550
 It is dedicated for your party 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.070
 I sincerely believed that it was all my 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.900
 please the previous match I did not have 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.150
 complications in sometimes winning you from 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.950
 I have abused and wanted to do 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.540
 the same in this game and take away the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.130
 maximum possible coins and be able to get 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.320
 the player as robben 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.150
 the first bounce that we invented in the 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.580
 party comes a bounce to the pim pam and 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.620
 a chilean abellán is marked, we return to 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.480
 continue with her abusing you already know 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.030
 pimpi I love good if marked 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.590
 then marked a milestone there jan another of 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.450
 the players that you recommended me and 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.310
 especially for me is the representation 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.020
 your since you are the ones who most 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.460
 you recommend this player really not what 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.050
 I knew until I recommended it 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.770
 I could play is this series with the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.820
 you see again with ease 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.100
 frightening obama was already taking off 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.030
 I think here and had six goals in 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.700
 two parties 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.320
 impressive imputable fallen more is 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.940
 true that when I start playing the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.960
 fatal with this player tried to abuse and 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.360
 so go see the options and even 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.610
 it could be passes and such but it's like a 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.770
 vice you know that they give you 50 thousand coins 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.880
 for a good player and you want to abuse 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.800
 and amosal and try to find 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.560
 continuously there you are seeing what 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.940
 well not only marked with water nickel already 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.680
 he had two goals with two players 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.780
 different were a total of 70,000 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.600
 coins but I was still checking and 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.370
 checking here we subtract 35 thousand 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.620
 coins a fallito and here I have to 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.960
 tell you 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.449
 I have a next tutorial on how to throw 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.940
 faults that will come practically then the 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.830
 80 something very similar to what I did there 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.090
 I'll explain it, you know it was always the 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.380
 player under the bat for us 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.720
 we have a way to counteract that 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.120
 you see that they make another penalty on me 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.400
 victory penalty this was super 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.169
 super important jump if there was a 2.0 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.150
 is that he jumped if he scored a penalty was 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.949
 the option to sign robben kids 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.290
 I was screwed and there you have it 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.330
 millán no fault there is never above are 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.310
 unstoppable and definitely there you have 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.850
 the result of the game nothing more and nothing 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.530
 less than 7 12 goals of the player 70,000 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:50.330
 moneditas 5 goals from our player 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.310
 feital 250,000 a goal against minus 35 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.620
 and we add those of the first game of 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.050
 the 185,000 that we had accumulated make 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.770
 a total of nothing more and nothing less than that 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.539
 of 470,000 coins as you see already 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.250
 We depended on that penalty that told you 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.810
 it was the last penalty I decided if 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.389
 we could get to the robben option already 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.650
 that costs 440 thousand coins to 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.110
 you are already seeing in the 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.580
 options that I will give you the first time 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.059
 that has robben and the second also 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.460
 so you are going to decide therefore if 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:21.259
 it's decision shows and you already know starting 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.849
 from the next chapter we will try 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.770
 start improving the hybrid part 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.559
 where will we meet the players 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.779
 of the app I'm very happy to get to 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:32.509
 the 470,000 coins because you are going to be able 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.669
 improve the team with a great player 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.619
 I'm really super happy I've gone 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.389
 pearls I believe that even the
