00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
think it's a game that Liverpool it's a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.220 
think it's a game that Liverpool it's a
must-win<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:27.210> pal<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.450> France<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.930> sounds

ridiculous<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.280> even<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.640> can't<00:02:29.940> believe<00:02:30.060> I'm

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
ridiculous and even I can't believe I'm

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.360 
ridiculous and even I can't believe I'm

you've<00:02:35.700> got<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.850> winner<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.270> what<00:02:36.450> would<00:02:36.540> you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
you've got a winner and what would you

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.090 
you've got a winner and what would you
do<00:02:36.780> betting<00:02:37.110> why<00:02:37.230> Steve<00:02:37.500> would<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.980> be

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
do betting why Steve would you be

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.530 
do betting why Steve would you be
confident<00:02:38.460> about<00:02:38.610> Liverpool<00:02:39.120> would<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.420> look

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
confident about Liverpool would you look

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.240 
confident about Liverpool would you look
at<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.660> 427<00:02:40.410> price<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.890> think<00:02:41.100> that's

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
at that 427 price and think that's

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
at that 427 price and think that's
probably<00:02:41.780> I'd<00:02:42.780> probably<00:02:42.990> want<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.350> find

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
probably I'd probably want to find

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.410 
probably I'd probably want to find
another<00:02:43.830> way<00:02:43.950> yes<00:02:45.080> 147<00:02:46.080> might<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.790> think

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
another way yes 147 might be I think

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.360 
another way yes 147 might be I think
we're<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> point<00:02:49.650> where<00:02:49.980> it's

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
we're just just at the point where it's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.550 
we're just just at the point where it's
it's<00:02:50.730> too<00:02:50.970> skinny<00:02:51.270> yeah<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.750> think<00:02:51.810> 425<00:02:52.380> you
