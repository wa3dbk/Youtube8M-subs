00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
warm the waters a little chopping so we

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.410 
warm the waters a little chopping so we
know<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.460> it's<00:00:08.820> going<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> be<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> good

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
setting for crabbing as you can see our

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.180 
setting for crabbing as you can see our
lines<00:00:12.300> already<00:00:12.599> set<00:00:12.990> out<00:00:13.019> you've<00:00:13.830> been<00:00:13.860> tied

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
lines already set out you've been tied

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.620 
lines already set out you've been tied
to<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.370> dock<00:00:14.610> chickens<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.299> end<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to the dock chickens on the end of the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.180 
to the dock chickens on the end of the
string<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.230> been<00:00:16.410> thrown<00:00:16.680> into<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
string and it's been thrown into the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.439 
string and it's been thrown into the
water<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.640> we're<00:00:17.760> ready<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> go

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
water so we're ready to go

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.290 
water so we're ready to go
now<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.410> wait<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.800> Chris<00:00:20.300> okay

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
now we just have to wait for Chris okay

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
now we just have to wait for Chris okay
so<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> line<00:00:22.740> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so you can see here that the line is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
so you can see here that the line is
pulling<00:00:23.640> tightly<00:00:24.029> which<00:00:24.900> could<00:00:25.109> mean<00:00:25.230> either

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
pulling tightly which could mean either

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.990 
pulling tightly which could mean either
one<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> crab<00:00:26.430> or<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:26.820> those<00:00:26.970> two

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
one that it's a crab or two those two

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.019 
one that it's a crab or two those two
fish<00:00:27.470> now<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.710> where<00:00:28.890> mom<00:00:29.130> has<00:00:29.609> pulled<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
fish now you see where mom has pulled it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
fish now you see where mom has pulled it
up<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.420> see<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.720> still<00:00:30.960> tight<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.560> most

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
up you can see it's still tight so most

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
up you can see it's still tight so most
likely<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.430> still<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> crab<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
likely it's still a crab that's on the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
likely it's still a crab that's on the
end<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.110> won't<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.440> until<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.860> completely

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
end you won't know until we completely

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.360 
end you won't know until we completely
pull<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.680> now<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> important<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
pull it in now the important thing to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.740 
pull it in now the important thing to
look<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.239> pulling<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
look here is for when you're pulling it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.830 
look here is for when you're pulling it
up<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> wait<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.280> chicken

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
up you have to wait to see the chicken

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.450 
up you have to wait to see the chicken
come<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.379> surface<00:00:43.620> or<00:00:43.920> close<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.219> the

come to the surface or close to the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
come to the surface or close to the
surface<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.410> exactly

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
surface so that we all know exactly

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
surface so that we all know exactly
where<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> crab<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.329> we're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
where the crab is so that's what we're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
where the crab is so that's what we're
pulling<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:49.770> now<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.460> way<00:00:50.579> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pulling in for right now so that way we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
pulling in for right now so that way we
can<00:00:50.850> wait<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.949> depending<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.010> how

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
can wait to see that depending on how

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
can wait to see that depending on how
long<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> line<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.000> may<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> minute<00:00:54.629> or

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
long the line is it may take a minute or

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
long the line is it may take a minute or
two<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.620> want<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> pull<00:00:56.070> too<00:00:56.100> fast<00:00:56.719> or

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
two you don't want to pull too fast or

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
two you don't want to pull too fast or
too<00:00:57.930> slow<00:00:58.280> because<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> crab<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.879> either

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
too slow because the crab will either

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.660 
too slow because the crab will either
ant<00:01:00.329> let<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.680> already<00:01:02.190> taking<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
ant let go if it's already taking a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
ant let go if it's already taking a
share<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> bait<00:01:03.439> or<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.769> too<00:01:04.979> quickly

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
share of the bait or if it's too quickly

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.130 
share of the bait or if it's too quickly
it<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.670> feel<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> jerk<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.780> let<00:01:06.930> go

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it will feel the jerk and it will let go

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
it will feel the jerk and it will let go
now<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> crab<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.729> coming<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
now here the crab is coming up to the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
now here the crab is coming up to the
surface<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.960> had<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> wait<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.680> close

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
surface you had a wait to get close

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.730 
surface you had a wait to get close
enough<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> take<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> net<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
enough can I take the net and then you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
enough can I take the net and then you
scoop<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> way<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> chicken<00:01:15.680> as

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
scoop it up that way with the chicken as

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350 
scoop it up that way with the chicken as
long<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.400> behind<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> crab<00:01:18.119> won't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
long as it's from behind the crab won't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.090 
long as it's from behind the crab won't
be<00:01:18.479> able<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> net<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:19.950> why

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
be able to see the net so that's why

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.710 
be able to see the net so that's why
it's<00:01:20.220> important<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> go<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.060> behind<00:01:21.330> or

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
it's important to go from behind or

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
it's important to go from behind or
underneath<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> crab<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.979> coming<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
underneath as the crab is coming up to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
underneath as the crab is coming up to
the<00:01:23.520> surface<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.619> ahead

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the surface so here we have to go ahead

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010 
the surface so here we have to go ahead
and<00:01:25.920> measure<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.280> he<00:01:27.240> has<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.630> four<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and measure in he has to be four and a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
and measure in he has to be four and a
half<00:01:28.080> inches<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.860> length<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.310> popsicle

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
half inches or the length of a popsicle

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
half inches or the length of a popsicle
stick<00:01:29.930> that's<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> legal<00:01:31.380> size<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.070> has<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.430> be

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
stick that's the legal size it has to be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.330 
stick that's the legal size it has to be
in<00:01:32.820> order<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> keep<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.310> just

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
in order to keep it so we're just

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.969 
in order to keep it so we're just
getting<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> stick<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.960> anywhere<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
getting the stick out here anywhere you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.350 
getting the stick out here anywhere you
can<00:01:38.100> put<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.759> long<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> claws

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
can put it down as long as the claws

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
can put it down as long as the claws
aren't<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> way<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.189> be

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
aren't in the way and it has to be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.840 
aren't in the way and it has to be
measured<00:01:41.579> from<00:01:41.759> point<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:43.320> point<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:44.579> one

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
measured from point to point so from one

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719 
measured from point to point so from one
side<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.689> points<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.729> right

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
side the points there on the right right

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.179 
side the points there on the right right
there<00:01:48.030> points<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.930> point<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there points a point all the way over to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.590 
there points a point all the way over to
the<00:01:50.280> other<00:01:50.399> side<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.180> where<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> has<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the other side that's where it has to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.069 
the other side that's where it has to
start<00:01:52.369> obviously<00:01:53.369> he's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.820> size<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.960> we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
start obviously he's a good size so we

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
start obviously he's a good size so we
would<00:01:55.259> keep<00:01:55.500> him<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.979> put<00:01:56.340> him<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> bucket

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
would keep him and put him in the bucket

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
would keep him and put him in the bucket
with<00:01:57.270> any<00:01:57.570> other<00:01:57.780> crabs<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> we've<00:01:58.380> already

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
with any other crabs that we've already

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.639 
with any other crabs that we've already
caught<00:01:59.719> which<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.869> what's<00:02:01.079> happening<00:02:01.469> right

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
caught which is what's happening right

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
caught which is what's happening right
now<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.369> buckets<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.060> keep<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
now the buckets there we keep it in the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.780 
now the buckets there we keep it in the
shade<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.259> way<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.560> stay<00:02:04.770> cool

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
shade so that way they stay cool

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.230 
shade so that way they stay cool
and<00:02:07.300> then<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:07.570> flip<00:02:07.750> over<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.170> net<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.700> put

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
and then we flip over the net and put

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.090 
and then we flip over the net and put
the<00:02:10.330> crab<00:02:10.570> in<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> bucket<00:02:11.200> sometimes<00:02:11.770> people

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
the crab in the bucket sometimes people

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.850 
the crab in the bucket sometimes people
come<00:02:12.250> out<00:02:12.370> easily<00:02:12.640> sometimes<00:02:13.420> he<00:02:13.600> does<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:13.990> if

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
come out easily sometimes he does not if

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
come out easily sometimes he does not if
he<00:02:15.010> gets<00:02:15.040> caught<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.700> his<00:02:15.850> legs<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.420> caught

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
he gets caught if his legs are caught

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.900 
he gets caught if his legs are caught
within<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> net<00:02:17.200> or<00:02:17.470> his<00:02:17.620> claws<00:02:17.950> which<00:02:18.730> is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
within the net or his claws which is

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.990 
within the net or his claws which is
what's<00:02:19.120> happening<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.600> now<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:21.610> very

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
what's happening here now to very

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.640 
what's happening here now to very
carefully<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.200> way<00:02:23.290> he<00:02:23.440> doesn't

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
carefully do that so that way he doesn't

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.590 
carefully do that so that way he doesn't
get<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.460> with<00:02:24.610> his<00:02:24.640> claws<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.300> too<00:02:25.420> big

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
get you with his claws it's too big

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.180 
get you with his claws it's too big
claws<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.990> then<00:02:29.230> once<00:02:29.410> he's<00:02:29.590> loosened<00:02:30.130> up

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
claws and then once he's loosened up

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.830 
claws and then once he's loosened up
even<00:02:30.460> just<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.730> little<00:02:30.760> bit<00:02:31.150> he'll<00:02:31.570> start

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
even just a little bit he'll start

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.710 
even just a little bit he'll start
moving<00:02:32.140> around<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:34.090> you'll<00:02:34.240> be<00:02:34.360> able<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
moving around and then you'll be able to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.670 
moving around and then you'll be able to
drop<00:02:35.140> him<00:02:35.350> into<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.800> bucket<00:02:37.350> he's<00:02:38.350> moving

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
drop him into the bucket he's moving

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.440 
drop him into the bucket he's moving
there<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.130> he's<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> little<00:02:39.550> bit<00:02:39.790> loose<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
there so he's a little bit loose and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.940 
there so he's a little bit loose and
trying<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.930> make<00:02:41.080> sure<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> other<00:02:41.680> claws

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
trying to make sure that the other claws

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.430 
trying to make sure that the other claws
of<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.160> other<00:02:42.340> crabs<00:02:42.610> don't<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.060> up<00:02:43.380> okay<00:02:44.380> so

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
of the other crabs don't get up okay so

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.380 
of the other crabs don't get up okay so
this<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:44.980> what<00:02:45.130> crabbing<00:02:45.550> looks<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:45.940> from<00:02:46.330> a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
this is what crabbing looks like from a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.060 
this is what crabbing looks like from a
distance<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.020> you're<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.320> right<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.650> top<00:02:47.890> of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
distance when you're not right on top of

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.550 
distance when you're not right on top of
it<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.150> an<00:02:49.240> idea<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.660> how<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
it so you can get an idea of how the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.950 
it so you can get an idea of how the
process<00:02:51.130> works<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.060> line<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.420> time<00:02:52.600> right<00:02:52.780> now

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
process works the line is time right now

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.600 
process works the line is time right now
so<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.680> know<00:02:53.800> there's<00:02:53.980> something<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.490> end

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
so we know there's something on the end

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.420 
so we know there's something on the end
of<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.150> we're<00:02:55.540> pulling<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.960> in<00:02:56.280> again<00:02:57.280> at<00:02:57.400> a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
of it so we're pulling it in again at a

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.640 
of it so we're pulling it in again at a
very<00:02:57.520> decent<00:02:58.090> pace<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:59.230> don't<00:02:59.380> want<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> go

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
very decent pace you don't want to go

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.790 
very decent pace you don't want to go
too<00:02:59.709> fast<00:03:00.160> or<00:03:00.400> too<00:03:00.580> slow<00:03:01.350> what<00:03:02.350> happens<00:03:02.680> is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
too fast or too slow what happens is

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.680 
too fast or too slow what happens is
what<00:03:02.950> get<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> line<00:03:03.520> up<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.970> then<00:03:04.209> we'll<00:03:04.390> go

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
what get the line up and then we'll go

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.840 
what get the line up and then we'll go
ahead<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.870> nut<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> crab<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.520> what<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:09.640> see

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
ahead and nut the crab and what you see

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.180 
ahead and nut the crab and what you see
here<00:03:09.880> where<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.390> line<00:03:10.600> just<00:03:10.870> went<00:03:11.110> slack<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
here where the line just went slack the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.280 
here where the line just went slack the
crab<00:03:12.550> seems<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.030> let<00:03:13.270> go<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.020> wait<00:03:14.260> a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
crab seems to let go so we just wait a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.280 
crab seems to let go so we just wait a
moment<00:03:14.530> we<00:03:15.250> let<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.520> line<00:03:15.730> sit<00:03:16.090> then<00:03:16.930> we<00:03:17.050> try

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
moment we let the line sit then we try

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.810 
moment we let the line sit then we try
it<00:03:17.350> again<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.950> see<00:03:18.100> here<00:03:18.310> how<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.580> tight

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
it again and you see here how it's tight

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.550 
it again and you see here how it's tight
again<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.540> how<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:19.780> know<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.110> crab<00:03:20.350> is

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
again that's how we know the crab is

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.420 
again that's how we know the crab is
still<00:03:20.739> on<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:22.930> wait<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.220> keep

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
still on it so we just wait and keep

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.800 
still on it so we just wait and keep
pulling<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.850> in<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.150> have<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.420> wait<00:03:25.570> again

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
pulling it in we have to wait again

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.240 
pulling it in we have to wait again
until<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.140> gets<00:03:26.260> close<00:03:26.560> enough<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
until it gets close enough to the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.060 
until it gets close enough to the
surface<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:29.110> where<00:03:29.260> we<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.500> go<00:03:29.650> ahead<00:03:29.769> and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
surface to where we can go ahead and

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.970 
surface to where we can go ahead and
take<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> net<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.709> scoop<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.830> up<00:03:32.920> with<00:03:33.100> that

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
take the net and scoop it up with that

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.470 
take the net and scoop it up with that
usually<00:03:35.980> we<00:03:36.100> like<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.430> back<00:03:36.790> off<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> little<00:03:37.180> bit

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
usually we like to back off a little bit

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.360 
usually we like to back off a little bit
because<00:03:38.200> depending<00:03:38.800> on<00:03:38.890> how<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.070> Sun

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
because depending on how the Sun

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.759 
because depending on how the Sun
reflects<00:03:39.820> off<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.330> net<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.810> may<00:03:41.350> see<00:03:41.410> it

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
reflects off of the net it may see it

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.620 
reflects off of the net it may see it
and<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.100> let<00:03:42.310> go<00:03:42.550> before<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.360> get<00:03:43.480> it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
and they let go before we can get it

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.410 
and they let go before we can get it
close<00:03:43.840> enough<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:45.070> we<00:03:45.220> wait<00:03:45.459> until<00:03:46.269> it's

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
close enough so we wait until it's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.360 
close enough so we wait until it's
extremely<00:03:47.110> close<00:03:47.320> which<00:03:47.500> unfortunately<00:03:47.800> you

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
extremely close which unfortunately you

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.780 
extremely close which unfortunately you
can't<00:03:48.640> see<00:03:48.850> from<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.150> angle<00:03:50.489> but<00:03:51.489> then<00:03:51.640> you

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
can't see from this angle but then you

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.400 
can't see from this angle but then you
will<00:03:51.940> see<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> Necco<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> water<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.200> once

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
will see the Necco in the water and once

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.369 
will see the Necco in the water and once
it<00:03:53.560> is<00:03:53.590> close<00:03:53.950> enough

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.410 

and<00:03:58.040> then<00:03:58.189> again<00:03:58.370> sometimes<00:03:58.790> we<00:03:58.909> have<00:03:58.999> to<00:03:59.150> take

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
and then again sometimes we have to take

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.089 
and then again sometimes we have to take
the<00:03:59.540> chicken<00:03:59.900> out<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.200> its<00:04:00.439> mouth<00:04:00.620> throw<00:04:01.040> it

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
the chicken out of its mouth throw it

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.209 
the chicken out of its mouth throw it
back<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.389> then<00:04:03.200> once<00:04:03.439> again<00:04:03.560> we<00:04:03.769> have<00:04:04.069> to

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:04.219 
back in and then once again we have to

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:06.489 
back in and then once again we have to
measure<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.609> we<00:04:05.450> always<00:04:05.719> measure<00:04:05.930> just<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.379> be

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:06.499 
measure it we always measure just to be

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.649 
measure it we always measure just to be
sure<00:04:07.689> that<00:04:08.689> it's<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:08.959> fact<00:04:09.019> size<00:04:10.659> again

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
sure that it's in fact size again

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.059 
sure that it's in fact size again
watching<00:04:12.019> for<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.260> claws<00:04:12.469> because<00:04:12.650> they<00:04:12.859> can

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
watching for the claws because they can

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.709 
watching for the claws because they can
actually<00:04:13.280> come<00:04:13.609> all<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:13.969> way<00:04:14.060> underneath<00:04:14.299> and

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
actually come all the way underneath and

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.189 
actually come all the way underneath and
get<00:04:14.989> you<00:04:15.139> from<00:04:15.260> underneath

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
get you from underneath

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.449 
get you from underneath
once<00:04:18.199> we<00:04:18.349> know<00:04:18.470> point<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.889> point<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.310> it's

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
once we know point to point that it's

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.339 
once we know point to point that it's
good<00:04:19.699> we<00:04:20.120> go<00:04:20.299> ahead<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:20.539> we<00:04:20.690> put<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.049> into<00:04:21.199> the

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
good we go ahead and we put it into the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.439 
good we go ahead and we put it into the
bucket<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:25.580> that's<00:04:25.669> basically<00:04:26.240> how<00:04:26.419> the

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
bucket and that's basically how the

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.180 
bucket and that's basically how the
process<00:04:26.960> there's<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.410> same<00:04:27.650> thing

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
process there's the same thing

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.529 
process there's the same thing
throwing<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> chicken<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.060> waiting

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
throwing the chicken out waiting

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.170 
throwing the chicken out waiting
visually<00:04:30.199> seeing<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.680> pulling<00:04:34.060> catching<00:04:35.060> the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
visually seeing it pulling catching the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.350 
visually seeing it pulling catching the
crab<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.599> then<00:04:35.720> putting<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.110> in<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.289> bucket

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
crab and then putting it in the bucket

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.820 
crab and then putting it in the bucket
being<00:04:38.360> careful<00:04:38.690> not<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.870> about<00:04:39.259> as<00:04:39.410> cool<00:04:39.650> as
