00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.170
 there is a very instructive activity and that 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 he loves children 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.900
 what it is to see how germinate 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.130
 seeds 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.130
 within a glass 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 we started making a cartridge with the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.460
 kitchen paper 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.460
 of the approximate height of the glass 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.940
 we adjust it to the edges 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.140
 the glass 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.760
 and with more kitchen paper 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 we fill it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.890
 at this point it is interesting to make a 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.080
 study of a seed 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.570
 all that we use in the garden 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.570
 They are formed by a germ 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.680
 and the cotyledons 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.040
 the germ on the inside develops 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.070
 in a salient that is not more than a 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.670
 miniature plant is plant when 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.220
 find moisture and adequate temperature 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.140
 it starts to develop and goes out 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 down a root that will be the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 responsible for absorbing the substances 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.390
 Soil minerals and upwards 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.100
 the leaves that will transform those 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.939
 mineral substances in food 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.540
 while he is able to do all this the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.520
 plant has to live feeding on 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.789
 the nutrients in the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.789
 Hotels 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 helping us with a pointed object 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.920
 we are introducing the seeds 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.700
 between the paper 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.700
 and the glass 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.380
 to better understand the development of 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.380
 germ 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.319
 we put the seeds one of them with 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.319
 the germ up 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.760
 with the germ to the left 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.819
 the third eat germ down 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.819
 and finally with the germ 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.810
 it only remains to put a little water on 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.810
 exterminator 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.350
 when it started to work 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.990
 in a couple of days the seeds have 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.460
 sprouted 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.120
 this one that had the germ towards 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.860
 right 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.860
 has already developed its root 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.710
 until I had down is the one that 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.710
 more has been developed 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.599
 it has also developed quite a lot 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.599
 that the ending the left 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.769
 and the one that had them up 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.940
 has spent a lot of energy in giving the 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.590
 return 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.590
 what has developed less 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.130
 two days later 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.040
 the stem has already sprouted dragging with 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.380
 him to the cotyledons and the rest of the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.700
 plant 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.700
 but only stress 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.810
 the fourth one is precisely the one 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.480
 had the germ up that had 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.250
 to go around 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.670
 is tangled in its own roots 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.690
 and it's costing him a lot to sprout 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.050
 it shows us what 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.960
 we can place 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.930
 the germ to the left towards the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.720
 right or down but never towards 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.260
 above 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.190
 Well this is where I want to take advantage of 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.300
 experiment 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.569
 8 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.569
 a glass of newspaper that he 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.340
 the seeds like from germ or towards 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.340
 down 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.470
 generous 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:17.240
 surely some 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.240
 good and this in my garden what is it used for ? 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.060
 well for what I have been able to see with 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.230
 this system 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.449
 here all the seeds germinate 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:35.249
 in the paper cup 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:39.639
 It is also more than one does not germinate 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:42.069
 you have two days to see it and replace it 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.639
 but there is no one to eat it 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:49.430
 no bug under ground 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.430
 there is no one to dry out due to lack of 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.919
 they end all 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:00.860
 in my area the green beans 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.860
 they are sown in blows 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.379
 it could be in each death 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.740
 are 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.349
 the whole block comes out perfectly 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.389
 well I doubt very much that this is the best 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.389
 system 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.580
 I do not know if it will be good 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.120
 but what I can assure you is that 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.120
 it is comfortable 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:09.560
 in a few days the day of the carmen is 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.560
 the deadline to put days 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.730
 so I'm going to take advantage for 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.730
 control it thoroughly
