00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.690
 Doctors will be very busy 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.190
 and teachers Dirk Möcking today 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.940
 despite previous commitments from the whole in the plan in the second there had been out 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.249
 Direction exit 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.610
 the market is going 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 Causer is greater and has chosen to do better now 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.069
 Of course, you can not talk nicely about making it beautiful 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:23.530
 for someone of kind 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.579
 brought from the early work 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.589
 you saw that you traveled 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.630
 to provide a pure white daffodils 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.440
 then I have white here 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.830
 are traditionally common 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.820
 by Dieter Schöndorfer 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 and the little general 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.900
 this is a very simple matter now and you will too 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.800
 could do after 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.260
 Letterman or take at the brands moss 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.440
 adapted to this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.150
 to cover the earth around the roots I got so dry from the plastic 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.160
 and put it in the glass so the shamrocks just below 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 Tesla 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 Unplug the connector and that already off 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.660
 Kandern beginning 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.660
 the single ones 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 The Giants are to add onion plants 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.350
 in q4 I also defended so a little in itself equal to three hits 2 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.590
 Percent together 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.600
 and now against 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.850
 that lead 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.430
 like these Nazis 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.840
 now a bit out of the glasshouse housekeeping beautiful Ondracek 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.190
 that is completely different places grow 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.750
 that of the whole 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.960
 So it is day to day another picture from the preference the flowers 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.290
 to open 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.330
 the blooms off like this terrain remain very flat about 140 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.080
 and in the colors bit play all the pastel tones or even one 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.630
 Lush blue checkered shirt borrowed 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 our beautiful color selection 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.190
 to champagne the whole thing now with 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.860
 A bit of Mosop binds you around the earth fiercely between the individual 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.389
 You can now enjoy the 8 percent desire and whim 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.319
 Of course we add other things, for example here 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.319
 so dries 2 liters added 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.739
 can an offer be created 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.659
 you can also do that so they do not have any 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.269
 So enter Rainer Maier and wait a year for great Fighter Goose Eggs in the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.869
 Round off a few more exercises 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.249
 the whole has 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.359
 Hannawald first hour of June his landscapes plant on the 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.639
 and imagine the bank flourishing again 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.709
 comes out of it
