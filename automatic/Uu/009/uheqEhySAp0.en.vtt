undone<00:02:53.180> from<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.570> back<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.110> just<00:02:54.380> pull

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
undone from the back you can just pull

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.100 
undone from the back you can just pull
it<00:02:54.920> off<00:02:55.040> from<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.060> front<00:02:56.239> now<00:02:56.540> first<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.989> all

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
it off from the front now first of all

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.810 
it off from the front now first of all
let<00:02:57.260> me<00:02:57.380> go<00:02:57.560> over<00:02:57.650> these<00:02:57.800> specifications<00:02:58.640> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
let me go over these specifications and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.610 
let me go over these specifications and
then<00:02:59.300> I'll<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> closer<00:02:59.930> look<00:03:00.080> at<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
then I'll have a closer look at the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.320 
then I'll have a closer look at the
headset<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.489> microphone<00:03:02.090> is

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
headset the microphone is

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.990 
headset the microphone is
omnidirectional<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.530> impedance<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.190> 2<00:03:04.489> point

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
omnidirectional the impedance is 2 point

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.840 
omnidirectional the impedance is 2 point
2<00:03:05.630> kilo<00:03:06.140> ohms<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:07.370> sensitivity<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:09.140> -

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
2 kilo ohms and the sensitivity is a -

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.949 
2 kilo ohms and the sensitivity is a -
38<00:03:10.959> decibels<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.440> speaker<00:03:13.160> drivers<00:03:13.670> are<00:03:13.959> 40

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
38 decibels the speaker drivers are 40

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.930 
38 decibels the speaker drivers are 40
millimeters<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.920> size<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.520> should<00:03:16.790> give

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
millimeters in size so that should give

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.789 
millimeters in size so that should give
you<00:03:17.000> some<00:03:17.060> decent<00:03:17.540> sound<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.260> frequency

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
you some decent sound the frequency

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.250 
you some decent sound the frequency
response<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.400> between<00:03:20.000> 20<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.390> 20,000<00:03:21.230> Hertz
