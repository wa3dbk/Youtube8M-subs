 come across this 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.520
 was probably a bit embarrassed because he found no point of reference 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.520
 Has 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.179
 Change at the time later 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.179
 Gert Hoffmann Gates 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.189
 Holbrooke dried 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.719
 So who maybe a bit aligned with 16 7 Hertz because two 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.120
 Test matches and his team play 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 so that at the moment 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 on the offensive a bit Sweden 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 many tackles led partly to battles 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.220
 yellow card 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.650
 Beijing Fitzner after this foul 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.650
 I do not have to complain "at the referee 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 Dominik Nowak from Bottrop 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.570
 for the game so far easy free kick and that is a bloody 11 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.700
 but Roland e 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 22 23 meters 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 Local chief the two before 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.320
 without problems 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 the animals Siebert the Brunswick year the showpiece 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 what drives 26 goals 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.930
 thanks to this topic parlando remains so the foot hesitated 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.060
 not at all 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.380
 from Regine to the Roots 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.170
 and for him comes Melvin Holwijn 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.560
 with the 31 here have teacher to back up her scenes 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.860
 the diagnosis will be played for about 75 76 minutes Braunschweig shows up 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.980
 in the place again 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.980
 in front of the box of Leno 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280
 Bow Terra Mater 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 the parents had 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.659
 Switzerland games 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 that is it must not have been 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.659
 on the other side Sebastian Henn 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.659
 as something like a bit of relief 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:39.019
 7300 spectators in the serious-abbe field now support their team 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 she needs the support 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.739
 that's one thing 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 Quality stands 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.419
 Kilian 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.299
 Strasser is out 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.349
 to 17 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.349
 just does not exist 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.569
 Arndt then the play will soon be gone 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.569
 the higgs part of the ice hockey bundesliga 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.569
 That's how the people of Linz beat 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.159
 in a Brunswick 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.159
 that floats in 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.159
 together with the head 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.419
 the scorer for 1 0 24 0 meanwhile complained of leadership for 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.619
 Fürth his team for FC Carl Zeiss 2 2 1 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.389
 be with his numbers 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.729
 each of the 14th 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.859
 it disturbs their citizens of a team which presses on the balance Eintracht 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.859
 Brunswick, they manage it 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.139
 with his head in between 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.379
 now it looks soulful and the seconds it is not long then everyone has here 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.979
 the victory in the bag 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.830
 but it can also be the equalizer of 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 she has not decided anything 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.599
 Nahles next to the general 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.219
 Waffensen everybody comes around 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.599
 one last 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:02.999
 with this shot 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.889
 it now runs stoppage time to be a place in a place 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.439
 Shot of Roland 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.429
 Luckily it did not hit him right the ball slips him over it 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.460
 At some point, he notes excitedly, of course, he wants to win the series here with a win 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.460
 continue but he has not yet in the bag 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.719
 now he is back with it now worth it 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.289
 it is accused 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.589
 Drexler had quite a few judges CEO Jon Stewart 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.050
 Fortunately, the latter is not tradable 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.499
 and now have 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:04.969
 Ben Sahar the show is said Mattera the box of Braunschweiger Str 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.699
 Yellow against Roland 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:21.020
 Rastas has moved into the numbers of Brunswick 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.020
 who have sold well here have kicked free 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.749
 he is castle 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:33.990
 he did that 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.930
 unbeaten in the fifth game in series and Reuter 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.139
 We have lost to a strong opponent from Braunschweig 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:41.999
 turned 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.119
 a strong performance 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:45.400
 Christian Moeller 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.270
 with the votes 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.610
 Congratulations to the victory against Eintracht Braunschweig and now where I am for her 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.140
 Score a very important goal because until then this is not too much 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.229
 together at the FCZ 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.909
 eto'o barns 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.229
 With the words money back, of course, I'm looking forward to everyone 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.460
 to fight the 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.610
 the DAX went to another refill 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.919
 About two weeks before we played, how did they do that? 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.229
 wonderful what the later is not changed something 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.649
 who practiced in training 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:13.819
 In any case we will play on the outside 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.300
 and if you never said that all would be done in the future and bring that 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.859
 Flank is speculating with vitamin on Marcos Daniel use 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.999
 it was deliberately 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:26.159
 the woman had to 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:28.839
 Dino Wieser done well 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:32.889
 we have the chance to embrace everyone »she says is like the Unna 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:35.029

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:39.960
 he is currently paradisiac in paradise she is now getting wider 

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.639
 Chest on Wednesday to Erfurt to the thuringia derby 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.309

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:49.099
 from the sunny ernst-abbe-sportfeld back to Leipzig 

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:51.459
 with a broad chest
