00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
to make it look like a rangefinder

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.640 
to make it look like a rangefinder
camera<00:00:51.760> then<00:00:52.480> in<00:00:52.600> this<00:00:52.720> case<00:00:52.930> does<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.470> trick

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
camera then in this case does the trick

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.610 
camera then in this case does the trick
as<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.280> nice<00:00:55.710> feeling<00:00:56.710> on<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.250> side<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.239> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
as a nice feeling on the side here and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.700 
as a nice feeling on the side here and
otherwise<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.860> is<00:01:00.210> made<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.330> plastic<00:01:01.710> it

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
otherwise it is made of plastic it

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.470 
otherwise it is made of plastic it
doesn't<00:01:02.980> add<00:01:03.070> any<00:01:03.250> extra<00:01:03.370> functionality<00:01:04.330> to

Guzman also it makes little lenses that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
Guzman also it makes little lenses that
you<00:01:09.670> can<00:01:09.970> snap<00:01:10.780> on<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.290> your<00:01:11.530> iPhone<00:01:12.190> and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
generally you have to stick our glue a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.970 
generally you have to stick our glue a
little<00:01:16.840> piece<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.080> metal<00:01:17.170> onto<00:01:17.530> your<00:01:17.650> phone<00:01:17.800> so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
little piece of metal onto your phone so

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.580 
little piece of metal onto your phone so
you<00:01:18.040> can<00:01:18.220> snap<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.760> magnetic<00:01:19.150> pieces<00:01:19.480> on<00:01:19.630> but

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
you can snap the magnetic pieces on but

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.010 
you can snap the magnetic pieces on but
with<00:01:20.740> this<00:01:20.890> case<00:01:21.159> you<00:01:21.520> can<00:01:21.880> just<00:01:22.210> snap<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
with this case you can just snap the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.140 
with this case you can just snap the
lens<00:01:23.230> on<00:01:23.409> here<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:24.550> that's<00:01:24.730> one<00:01:24.880> little

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
lens on here so that's one little

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.480 
lens on here so that's one little
advantage<00:01:25.510> with<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.930> I'll<00:01:26.830> take<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.100> apart<00:01:27.340> so

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
advantage with it I'll take it apart so

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
advantage with it I'll take it apart so
you<00:01:27.550> can<00:01:27.729> check<00:01:28.120> how<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.530> gets<00:01:29.530> put<00:01:29.830> together

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.560 

so<00:01:38.590> there<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.850> phone<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:40.390> just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
so there it is the phone and it just

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.560 
so there it is the phone and it just
slides<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.130> fit<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:42.460> also<00:01:42.760> good<00:01:42.970> it's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
slides on the fit is also good it's

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.390 
slides on the fit is also good it's
really<00:01:44.050> tight<00:01:44.320> on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.590> phone<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.130> feels

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
really tight on the phone so it feels

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.430 
really tight on the phone so it feels
like<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.730> does<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.360> provide<00:01:48.270> backwards

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
like it does it provide backwards

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.010 
like it does it provide backwards
provides<00:01:50.440> good<00:01:50.680> protection<00:01:50.710> for<00:01:51.250> your<00:01:51.370> phone

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
provides good protection for your phone

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.590 
provides good protection for your phone
it<00:01:53.020> adds<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.320> fair<00:01:53.500> bit<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.680> width<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.360> phone

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
it adds a fair bit of width to the phone

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.090 
it adds a fair bit of width to the phone
which<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.870> perhaps<00:01:56.650> 182<00:01:57.520> point<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:59.100> when

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
which is perhaps 182 point and when

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.290 
which is perhaps 182 point and when
you're<00:02:00.190> putting<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.490> together<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.940> comes<00:02:01.060> with

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
you're putting it together it comes with

you're putting it together it comes with
there's<00:02:01.780> two<00:02:01.990> side<00:02:02.200> pieces<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.750> there's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
there's two side pieces can then there's

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.460 
there's two side pieces can then there's
a<00:02:04.810> little<00:02:05.110> marker<00:02:05.920> here<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:07.739> like<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.770> SLR<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
a little marker here and like a SLR you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.430 
a little marker here and like a SLR you
just<00:02:11.709> match<00:02:11.890> up<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.280> dots<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:14.050> one<00:02:14.260> also

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
just match up the dots and this one also

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.110 
just match up the dots and this one also
has<00:02:14.739> two<00:02:15.129> different<00:02:15.250> lenses<00:02:15.640> which<00:02:15.819> are<00:02:15.940> nice

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
has two different lenses which are nice

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.180 
has two different lenses which are nice
if<00:02:16.930> you're<00:02:17.080> putting<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.500> your<00:02:17.709> pocket

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
if you're putting this in your pocket

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.160 
if you're putting this in your pocket
it<00:02:18.760> gets<00:02:18.940> pretty<00:02:19.120> thick<00:02:19.269> with<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:19.780> larger

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
it gets pretty thick with this larger

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.190 
it gets pretty thick with this larger
lens<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.580> it's<00:02:21.760> good<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.209> have<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.510> inner<00:02:22.959> one

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
lens so it's good to have this inner one

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.900 
lens so it's good to have this inner one
which<00:02:23.410> fits<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:25.000> thin<00:02:25.780> profile<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:27.010> it'll<00:02:27.610> snap

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
which fits a thin profile and it'll snap

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.720 
which fits a thin profile and it'll snap
together<00:02:28.239> really<00:02:28.450> nice<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.410> snap<00:02:29.830> this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
together really nice and you snap this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.400 
together really nice and you snap this
piece<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.330> pulls<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.750> two<00:02:31.870> sides<00:02:32.140> together

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
piece on it pulls the two sides together

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.800 
piece on it pulls the two sides together
and<00:02:32.800> then<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:33.790> put<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> lens<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.510> top<00:02:34.540> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
and then you can put the lens on top of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.630 
and then you can put the lens on top of
that<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:37.769> then<00:02:38.769> there's<00:02:39.099> this<00:02:39.189> top<00:02:39.459> piece

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
that and then there's this top piece

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.949 
that and then there's this top piece
that<00:02:40.709> snaps<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.920> at<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.129> end

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
that snaps on at the end

you like Instagram or any of the
third-party<00:03:13.599> camera<00:03:14.140> apps<00:03:14.319> these<00:03:14.799> buttons

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
third-party camera apps these buttons

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.699 
third-party camera apps these buttons
work<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.780> still<00:03:16.780> volume<00:03:17.140> buttons<00:03:17.410> they<00:03:17.530> don't

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
work as still volume buttons they don't

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.800 
work as still volume buttons they don't
work<00:03:17.830> as<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.340> shutter<00:03:18.640> button<00:03:18.700> if<00:03:19.569> you<00:03:19.720> use

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
work as the shutter button if you use

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.180 
work as the shutter button if you use
the<00:03:20.049> iPhone<00:03:20.650> app<00:03:22.079> then<00:03:23.079> this<00:03:23.530> button<00:03:24.010> works

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
the iPhone app then this button works

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.819 
the iPhone app then this button works
like<00:03:24.370> your<00:03:24.489> shutter<00:03:24.640> button<00:03:25.530> like<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.650> should

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
like your shutter button like it should

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.680 
like your shutter button like it should
so<00:03:27.640> that's<00:03:28.030> something<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.420> could<00:03:28.599> obviously

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
so that's something you could obviously

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.780 
so that's something you could obviously
check<00:03:29.079> if<00:03:29.530> there's<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:29.920> camera<00:03:30.400> app<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.610> like

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
check if there's a camera app you like

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.640 
check if there's a camera app you like
if<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.299> can<00:03:31.569> use<00:03:31.690> your<00:03:31.870> volume<00:03:32.200> button<00:03:32.230> as

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
if you can use your volume button as

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.930 
if you can use your volume button as
your<00:03:32.860> shutter<00:03:33.040> button<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:33.790> will

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
your shutter button then this will

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.780 
your shutter button then this will
obviously<00:03:34.030> work<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:36.130> other<00:03:36.190> ports<00:03:36.579> are<00:03:36.700> all

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
obviously work the other ports are all

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.580 
obviously work the other ports are all
their<00:03:36.940> headphones<00:03:37.209> are<00:03:37.750> available<00:03:38.140> on<00:03:38.380> off

thing<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.150> isn't<00:03:46.450> here<00:03:46.569> however<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.109> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
thing that isn't here however is the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.370 
thing that isn't here however is the
mute<00:03:48.430> button<00:03:48.459> if<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.510> want<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.750> get<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
mute button if you want to get to that

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.780 
mute button if you want to get to that
you'd<00:03:50.709> have<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.920> take<00:03:51.069> off<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.340> top<00:03:51.400> piece

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you'd have to take off this top piece

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.940 
you'd have to take off this top piece
and<00:03:52.980> get<00:03:53.980> your<00:03:54.220> mute<00:03:54.430> under<00:03:54.700> here<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:56.170> one

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
and get your mute under here and one

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.789 
and get your mute under here and one
other<00:03:57.810> thought<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.350> 30-pin<00:03:59.739> connector

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
other thought the 30-pin connector

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.780 
other thought the 30-pin connector
connects<00:04:00.609> correctly<00:04:01.569> but<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.980> headphone

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
connects correctly but the headphone

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
connects correctly but the headphone
jack<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:05.170> iPhone<00:04:05.730> headphones<00:04:06.730> fit<00:04:07.420> in<00:04:07.569> there

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
jack the iPhone headphones fit in there

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.690 
jack the iPhone headphones fit in there
they<00:04:08.319> have<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.530> nice<00:04:08.709> small<00:04:09.069> round

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
they have that nice small round

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.640 
they have that nice small round
connector<00:04:09.940> but<00:04:10.269> if<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.690> headphones

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
connector but if you have headphones

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.840 
connector but if you have headphones
like<00:04:12.040> these<00:04:12.600> ones<00:04:13.600> from<00:04:13.810> Sony<00:04:14.579> which<00:04:15.579> have<00:04:15.760> an

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
like these ones from Sony which have an

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.409 
like these ones from Sony which have an
end<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:17.380> on<00:04:17.620> them<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:19.000> try<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.269> put

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
end like this on them you try to put

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.290 
end like this on them you try to put
that<00:04:19.450> in<00:04:20.320> there

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
that in there

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.469 
that in there
it's<00:04:22.979> this<00:04:23.979> bit<00:04:24.400> here<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.729> too<00:04:24.910> big<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.240> squish

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
it's this bit here is too big to squish

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.839 
it's this bit here is too big to squish
in<00:04:25.630> there<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.919> can't<00:04:27.160> use<00:04:27.400> headphones

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
in there so you can't use headphones

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.159 
in there so you can't use headphones
that<00:04:28.030> don't<00:04:28.240> have<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:29.940> iPhone<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.210> almond<00:04:32.020> a

that don't have that iPhone and almond a
couple<00:04:32.560> other<00:04:32.710> things<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.370> didn't<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.610> about

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
couple other things I didn't like about

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.839 
couple other things I didn't like about
the<00:04:33.970> case<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:35.500> top<00:04:35.919> piece<00:04:36.099> here<00:04:36.460> where

the case is this top piece here where
your<00:04:38.039> camera<00:04:39.039> straps<00:04:39.340> would<00:04:39.520> go<00:04:39.729> if<00:04:39.940> you

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
your camera straps would go if you

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.610 
your camera straps would go if you
wanted<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.539> use<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:41.169> with<00:04:41.349> a<00:04:41.380> camera<00:04:41.710> strap

off extremely easily and if you had a

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.879 
off extremely easily and if you had a
camera<00:05:08.740> strapped<00:05:09.569> I'll<00:05:10.569> just<00:05:10.869> put<00:05:11.529> this<00:05:11.649> on

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
camera strapped I'll just put this on

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.570 
camera strapped I'll just put this on
for<00:05:12.339> simplicity<00:05:12.819> and<00:05:14.069> it's<00:05:15.069> gonna<00:05:15.219> stay<00:05:15.460> on

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
for simplicity and it's gonna stay on

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.179 
for simplicity and it's gonna stay on
pretty<00:05:15.939> good<00:05:16.059> but<00:05:16.990> if<00:05:17.259> you<00:05:17.680> got<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:18.039> little

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
pretty good but if you got a little

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.649 
pretty good but if you got a little
crooked<00:05:18.399> and<00:05:18.909> it's<00:05:19.119> hanging<00:05:19.270> out<00:05:19.479> of<00:05:19.539> your

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
crooked and it's hanging out of your

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.019 
crooked and it's hanging out of your
neck<00:05:19.779> like<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:21.330> comes<00:05:22.330> off<00:05:22.539> pretty<00:05:23.319> quick<00:05:23.529> so

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
neck like this comes off pretty quick so

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.129 
neck like this comes off pretty quick so
if<00:05:25.029> they're<00:05:25.360> going<00:05:25.449> to<00:05:25.509> make<00:05:25.659> your<00:05:25.749> version<00:05:25.990> -

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
if they're going to make your version -

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.119 
if they're going to make your version -
I<00:05:26.409> think<00:05:26.529> I<00:05:26.860> would<00:05:26.979> want<00:05:27.279> this<00:05:28.439> fixed<00:05:29.439> a<00:05:29.830> little

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
I think I would want this fixed a little

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.329 
I think I would want this fixed a little
bit<00:05:30.990> perhaps

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
bit perhaps

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.109 
bit perhaps
so<00:05:33.339> these<00:05:33.959> camera<00:05:34.959> strap<00:05:35.580> attachment<00:05:36.580> points

00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:37.119 
so these camera strap attachment points

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:39.179 
so these camera strap attachment points
were<00:05:37.270> connected<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:38.289> whole<00:05:38.559> part<00:05:39.009> around

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
were connected to the whole part around

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:41.369 
were connected to the whole part around
the<00:05:39.399> body<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:39.909> case<00:05:40.089> so<00:05:40.360> you're<00:05:41.110> not<00:05:41.229> going

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
the body of the case so you're not going

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.609 
the body of the case so you're not going
to<00:05:41.439> lose<00:05:41.499> your<00:05:41.619> iPhone<00:05:42.959> otherwise<00:05:43.959> you<00:05:44.199> can

00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:44.619 
to lose your iPhone otherwise you can

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:46.709 
to lose your iPhone otherwise you can
just<00:05:44.649> stick<00:05:44.919> it<00:05:45.009> in<00:05:45.069> your<00:05:45.189> bag<00:05:45.369> or<00:05:45.639> your<00:05:46.389> pocket

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
just stick it in your bag or your pocket

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:48.869 
just stick it in your bag or your pocket
if<00:05:46.809> you<00:05:46.839> have<00:05:46.990> big<00:05:47.139> pockets<00:05:47.499> but<00:05:48.369> I<00:05:48.550> wouldn't

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
if you have big pockets but I wouldn't

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.389 
if you have big pockets but I wouldn't
trust<00:05:49.089> these<00:05:49.449> little<00:05:49.809> loops<00:05:50.129> to<00:05:51.129> hold<00:05:51.309> my

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:51.399 
trust these little loops to hold my

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.639 
trust these little loops to hold my
camera<00:05:51.779> so<00:05:52.779> overall<00:05:52.990> it's<00:05:53.229> a<00:05:53.289> good<00:05:53.379> fit<00:05:53.559> in

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
camera so overall it's a good fit in

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.790 
camera so overall it's a good fit in
case<00:05:54.059> a<00:05:55.059> little<00:05:55.149> class<00:05:55.959> sticky<00:05:56.229> feeling<00:05:56.559> and<00:05:56.770> a

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
case a little class sticky feeling and a

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.959 
case a little class sticky feeling and a
few<00:05:57.520> little<00:05:57.789> design<00:05:58.180> quirks<00:05:59.139> but<00:05:59.830> overall<00:06:00.819> it

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
few little design quirks but overall it

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.100 
few little design quirks but overall it
does<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.240> job<00:06:01.389> it<00:06:01.569> looks<00:06:01.599> like<00:06:01.870> a<00:06:01.899> retro

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
does the job it looks like a retro

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.589 
does the job it looks like a retro
camera<00:06:02.589> and<00:06:02.909> if<00:06:03.909> you're<00:06:04.029> looking<00:06:04.120> for<00:06:04.389> a<00:06:04.419> case

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
camera and if you're looking for a case

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.749 
camera and if you're looking for a case
that<00:06:04.959> looks<00:06:05.409> original<00:06:05.649> that<00:06:06.009> looks<00:06:06.189> good<00:06:06.459> then

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
that looks original that looks good then

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.569 
that looks original that looks good then
it'll<00:06:07.240> do<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:07.539> trick
