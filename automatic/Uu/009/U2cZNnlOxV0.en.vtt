00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.480
 priming technical montages 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.090
 approach there today if I do this 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.000
 video is to show you a product 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.260

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.909

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.450
 range is really getting bigger so this one 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.140
 it's a power smoke so it's a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.660

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.890
 supreme version this word by cons that I 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.310
 do not have right now where I'm waiting for my 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.550
 command that is recommended to put 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.730

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.659
 effects that can do in you for 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.180
 show you the visual effect and while 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.870
 imagining the facts 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.700
 indeed how to say to tractant level 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.489
 odors and visuals for the map 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.010
 so here I 'm going to give you a try with 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.689
 a boil is floating so by 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.400
 against I want to say it must not 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.560
 hesitate 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.280
 we put a good layer me perso I like 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:46.840
 well to the masters d good I'm going 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:50.500
 show are like that if you put 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 well everywhere for you put in same 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.129
 time on your stick 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.599
 we looked at what will happen 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:12.340
 immediately look we see a reaction 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:14.620
 chemical that produces so look at it 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.129
 already starting to spread so compared 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.459
 to other topping booster as he 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.489
 exists that one a pretty diffusion 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.269
 average so watch it diffuse not 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.280
 too slowly 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.849
 neither too fast and they unload 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.030
 really good business so 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:38.500
 look at the same time the visual effect this 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.209
 beautiful neon green that attracts 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.159
 carps the cargos concentrated immediately 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.959
 evening without this cloud that will happen 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.609
 and at the same time on the smell that goes 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.409
 free 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.129
 imagine when you have a style or a 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.780
 bag pb1 in addition imagine the cloud that is going 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.139
 happen 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.549
 look at her and I'll simulate you like 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.810
 if I'm going to simulate you 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.599
 fish tapping 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.689
 you will see that the more we move and 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.250
 keep it moving 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.780
 look I do not move very fast 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.879
 look of one even I looked but 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.479
 just that the bottle then moves 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.970
 the more diffusion is done so when he 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.490
 camp there is a slight current the 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.970
 little whites hitting on it 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.650
 how to say accelerated the attractiveness of 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.330
