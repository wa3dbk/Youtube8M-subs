 we guarantee anonymity 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.640
 that is 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.020
 was the person who hands the gun in the hand has to identify 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.890

 so he carries the rifles for example 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.810
 appeared feared to be finalized the teams carrying a weapon 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.870
 anonymity is precisely what secured this position that today 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.570
 we are having that in our view is enough sector since 2004 the campaign 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.940
 disarmament was responsible for withdrawing from circulation 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.490
 about 570 thousand weapons 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.009

 of what protection 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.940
 the figures show clearly 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.280
 that those who try to use the weapon to defend themselves 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.680
 have a greater chance of being killed 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.180
 by being mutually affected
