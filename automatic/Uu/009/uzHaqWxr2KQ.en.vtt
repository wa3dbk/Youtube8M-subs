00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.330
 here it is a 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 the international copyright symbol 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.759
 sounds a cool thing 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.349
 how do you get the chance to use this thing as you get 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.349
 copyright 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.560
 and very long to explain 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.140
 I finished 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.160
 there is nothing to do the copyright you do not get city 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.079
 in the moment in which he is the author of the photograph 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.560
 I explain better why he didn't explain 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.140
 then first the international symbol copyright the registered cig 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 in a circle 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 it is not a brand to be acquired 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 following a procedure, for example, the written word c does not mean brand 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.190
 registered and that yes 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.610
 vaol held by registering the trademark trademark 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.910
 rent laces instead written in my circles this not this symbol 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.120
 it is called the international copyright symbol and because it symbolizes 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.109
 uniquely internationally so that it is understood by everyone 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.889
 that that thing that accompanied by the symbol you protected by copyright 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.060
 copiright which means the right to copy the rights of the author 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.600
 copyright and copyright law are the same thing that copiright about was 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.840
 better because star tracker sounds in English 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.320
 then you symbol I said to symbolize the existence of a right that protects you that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 protects images 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.010
 no need to ask anyone has the right to use that symbol that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.550
 symbol can be used freely by any author freely 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.530
 because that symbol because independently of the alphabet that 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 is used we are the Latin alphabet 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.600
 in india my russian in arabia 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.370
 other alphabets are used 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.370
 I don't know how many hundreds of ups are the aforementioned world but so many 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.680
 for us it is taken for granted that the writing will copy that I want to say something in 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.640
 English 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.570
 but not for all the countries of the world, then, what was identified as 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.390
 symbol that beyond the beautiful of the graphic system you use to communicate 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.219
 with the others 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.409
 even if there is an alien you use 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.110
 and also you can understand thanks to that symbol 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.560
 under that thing was a right that is protected because I doubt that of 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.639
 an audio author author comment 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.929
 therefore that symbol of usability free 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.129
 how to get the copiright instead or as a copyright 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.599
 nothing needs to be done, nothing needs to be done because of our law 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.379
 I prepare the law in Italy that the law 683 bar 41 is very easy to find 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.249
 Network 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.749
 pepper milk law on the author law 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.919
 author of a photographic image 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.599
 the one who declares himself to be that which is declared in the news that author 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.470
 this leads to a problem 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.309
 on an aspect and that is how I show that I am an author 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.529
 problem we will talk about we will discuss in another video 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.529
 next this is the same dance playlist 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.479
 so expected that we should not do anything other than to be the authors of the photographs 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.069
 what we have to tell ourselves that 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.069
 once I have the right author because only the author 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.099
 how can I see it or access someone else can take me away 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.049
 then the law says that the law belongs to the author because the author did the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.219
 Photos do not need to do anything else that need not necessarily be 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.159
 registered to the siae does not need to have belonged some secret congregation of 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.560
 photographers are not needed 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.109
 nothing else that proves it 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.249
 to be an author 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.069
 it is important though that 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 at the time when or takes the picture 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.569
 It is important to understand that at the moment in which it is possible to realize photography I am 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.840
 holder of all the rights but from then on I igo these rights of can happen 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.649
 I can transfer to others 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:49.329
 since the only way to describe how the hell these have been transferred 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.989
 civil rights success to you to leave a friction a track written by 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.139
 somewhere 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.019
 the only way to protect the copyright that is naturally is that 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.939
 to describe what you are giving up 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.089
 caution 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.559
 if only this thing of this video remains impressed we have everything 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:07.539
 result 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.179
 if the photo is taken at the request of some one and therefore there is a 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.160
 customer 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.200
 there is someone who has me who is running that capital edit photo 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.019
 importance that there be a written record 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.570
 what I'm selling or I'm even giving up free 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.779
 to my client 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.750
 because the law 600 33 41 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.950
 provides as an automatic the fact that to the passive customer all the rights of 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.029
 image exploitation 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.919
 within the limits of the purpose of the agreement 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.319
 therefore with the limits the purposes that 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.330
 I placed my client 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.810
 the rights pass 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.719
 to the client 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:50.710
 if there is no limit, if I do not write the purpose 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.210
 the customer there 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.029
 give it all 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:59.649
 in the e-mail that we exchange in the fax that is signed in the quote if they give a fuck 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.150
 I don't have a contract quote because often you can't get it 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.820
 at least in the invoice 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.590
 but however one may wade the name generically photograph not geri 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.450
 that mind that lies my performances not generically photographic service but 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.240
 something that describes what I'm giving up 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.210
 photographs in 1 15 can trade fairs 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.909
 subject pinco pallo 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.550
 for 2013 catalog 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.199
 then these photographs can be used per catalog 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.139
 in 2013 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.159
 not after and for nothing else 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.580
 you don't need a complicated contract to describe this core doing 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.909
 list of things that are prohibited 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.370
 in a lease 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.539
 photo pruned if I wrote rent on the third floor that graphitized third floor 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.449
 there is no contract that describes that the first second e is not rented 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.460
 fourth and fifth floor 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.439
 it goes without saying 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.059
 rent the third one he is outside 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.699
 goes without saying you cede publication rights for once in a magazine and all 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.270
 other rights are out 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.270
 however, it must be specified because it does not specify what happens all 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.990
 what happens to the palace 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.080
 all 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.080
 of the rights keith yeah the author 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.820
 the copyright law then 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.449
 several other pdfs 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.449
 one of those weirdest I tell you all about the site to talk about nice to explain that 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.650
 what can you actually bring with you 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.689
 the distinction between 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.500
 photo creative intellectual works 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.990
 oook simple photographs 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.710
 manali images 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.529
 because we are interested in describing this thing 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.839
 because there are some practical effects and other effects that are blowjobs 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.000
 mental but it is good to know 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.600
 and we do this in another video that we make ago. to the cretin photos that 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.509
 to the photos 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.789
 16 photography
