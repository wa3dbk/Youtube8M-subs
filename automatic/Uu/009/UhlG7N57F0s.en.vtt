00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.230 
two colors there was a third but it fell
out<00:01:23.649> but<00:01:23.679> we<00:01:24.009> don't<00:01:24.159> need<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.369> one<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:25.149> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240

two orangie ones and same brush and just
lightly<00:01:31.899> pack<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.619> on<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.220> first<00:01:33.460> shade<00:01:33.969> we

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
lightly pack it on to the first shade we

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:50.230 
lightly pack it on to the first shade we
did

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.270 

so<00:01:50.990> if<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:51.170> have<00:01:51.290> anything<00:01:51.470> similar<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.040> that

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
so if you have anything similar to that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.069 
so if you have anything similar to that
or<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:53.060> one-set<00:01:53.420> process<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.990> are

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
or just a one-set process that are

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.510 
or just a one-set process that are
closer<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:55.009> go<00:01:55.130> ahead<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.369> use

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
closer to this you can go ahead and use

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.359 
closer to this you can go ahead and use
that<00:01:55.549> i<00:01:56.000> did<00:01:56.659> use<00:01:56.899> this<00:01:57.200> benefit<00:01:57.920> cream<00:01:58.130> shadow

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
that i did use this benefit cream shadow

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.889 
that i did use this benefit cream shadow
first<00:01:58.640> just<00:01:58.939> because<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.270> holds<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.540> pigment

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
first just because it holds a pigment

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.660 
first just because it holds a pigment
more<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.649> actually<00:02:00.799> holds<00:02:01.430> out<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
more and it actually holds out the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.700 
more and it actually holds out the
pigment<00:02:02.090> more<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:02.810> by<00:02:02.990> itself<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.470> kind<00:02:03.649> of

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
pigment more this by itself is kind of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.440 
pigment more this by itself is kind of
like<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.979> wash<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.610> glow<00:02:04.850> because<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
like a wash of a glow because it is a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.559 
like a wash of a glow because it is a
bronzer<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.140> really<00:02:07.360> meant<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
bronzer it's not really meant to have a

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.339 
bronzer it's not really meant to have a
lot<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.720> pigment<00:02:09.050> like<00:02:09.110> an<00:02:09.229> eyeshadow<00:02:11.349> so

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
lot of pigment like an eyeshadow so

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.170 
lot of pigment like an eyeshadow so
after<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:12.890> your<00:02:13.040> warm<00:02:13.340> blood<00:02:13.640> color<00:02:13.880> you

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
after you have your warm blood color you

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.309 
after you have your warm blood color you
go<00:02:14.269> ahead<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.569> take<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.170> highlight<00:02:15.739> color<00:02:15.769> and

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
go ahead and take a highlight color and

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.500
