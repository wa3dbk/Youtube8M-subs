weather and we're going to checking out

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.180 
weather and we're going to checking out
something<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.929> little<00:00:13.530> bit<00:00:13.620> different<00:00:14.040> from

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
something a little bit different from

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.210 
something a little bit different from
our<00:00:14.400> usual<00:00:15.109> computer<00:00:16.109> hardware<00:00:16.440> things<00:00:16.890> but

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
our usual computer hardware things but

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580 
our usual computer hardware things but
we're<00:00:17.760> moving<00:00:17.910> into<00:00:18.480> more<00:00:18.750> camera<00:00:19.170> reviews

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
we're moving into more camera reviews

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.670 
we're moving into more camera reviews
and<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.520> today<00:00:20.850> we're<00:00:21.779> checking<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.410> SOL

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and so today we're checking out the SOL

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700 
and so today we're checking out the SOL
shot<00:00:23.039> -<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> very<00:00:24.119> unique<00:00:24.330> tool<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
shot - this is a very unique tool to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.929 
shot - this is a very unique tool to
help<00:00:25.800> solo<00:00:26.699> videographers<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.840> capture<00:00:28.289> their

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.980 
help solo videographers to capture their
motion<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.119> whatever<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.570> want<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> do

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
motion or whatever they want to do

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.260 
motion or whatever they want to do
without<00:00:31.500> actually<00:00:32.189> touching<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> camera<00:00:32.880> so

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
without actually touching the camera so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.690 
without actually touching the camera so
if<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.960> burr<00:00:34.320> wave<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> camera

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
if a burr wave to the camera

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
if a burr wave to the camera
so<00:00:35.880> Ebers<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> video<00:00:37.050> guy<00:00:37.230> right<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.590> but

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so Ebers the the video guy right now but

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
so Ebers the the video guy right now but
if<00:00:38.280> Eva<00:00:38.700> wasn't<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.750> could<00:00:40.320> potentially

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
if Eva wasn't there I could potentially

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.090 
if Eva wasn't there I could potentially
use<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.219> device<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.910> help<00:00:42.480> me<00:00:42.890> do<00:00:43.890> things

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
use this device to help me do things

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
use this device to help me do things
like<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.969> stand<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.480> Eber<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.260> try<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
like this if I stand up Eber will try to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
like this if I stand up Eber will try to
track<00:00:47.039> me<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.280> follow<00:00:47.670> me<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.510> move<00:00:48.660> around

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
track me and follow me as I move around

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.490 
track me and follow me as I move around
the<00:00:49.500> scene<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.510> wasn't<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.289> if

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the scene but if it wasn't there and if

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.020 
the scene but if it wasn't there and if
I<00:00:52.590> had<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> tripod<00:00:53.070> set<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.520> there<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:53.940> be

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
I had a tripod set up there it would be

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.740 
I had a tripod set up there it would be
very<00:00:54.210> difficult

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
very difficult

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
very difficult
this<00:00:54.930> solo<00:00:55.469> shot<00:00:55.710> device<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> name<00:00:56.670> solo

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this solo shot device by the name solo

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770 
this solo shot device by the name solo
implies<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.870> single<00:00:58.590> individual<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> this

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
implies a single individual and this

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
implies a single individual and this
device<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.320> help<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.489> camera<00:01:02.879> track<00:01:03.239> me

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
device will help the camera track me

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
device will help the camera track me
wherever<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.189> today<00:01:05.460> we'll<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
wherever I go and so today we'll be

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.670 
wherever I go and so today we'll be
checking<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.479> terms<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> how<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> set

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
checking it out in terms of how to set

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.830 
checking it out in terms of how to set
it<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.729> works<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.780> let's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it up and actually how it works so let's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.469 
it up and actually how it works so let's
get<00:01:10.049> started<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> basics<00:01:11.909> behind<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
get started and so the basics behind the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.109 
get started and so the basics behind the
solo<00:01:12.689> shot<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> assembly<00:01:13.979> consists<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
solo shot to assembly consists of the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.090 
solo shot to assembly consists of the
base<00:01:15.330> unit<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.020> has<00:01:16.229> some<00:01:16.500> weight<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
base unit that has some weight to it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.700 
base unit that has some weight to it
at<00:01:17.220> two<00:01:17.460> pounds<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.119> feels<00:01:18.689> solid<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.530> main

check out the setup process and here is
where<00:02:54.669> I<00:02:54.699> realized<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.840> setup<00:02:56.169> is<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.349> little

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
where I realized the setup is a little

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.289 
where I realized the setup is a little
bit<00:02:56.650> more<00:02:56.829> complicated<00:02:57.280> than<00:02:57.669> it<00:02:57.849> should<00:02:58.120> be

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
bit more complicated than it should be

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.899 
bit more complicated than it should be
and<00:02:58.540> would<00:02:59.199> turn<00:02:59.409> off<00:02:59.650> potential<00:03:00.310> casual

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
and would turn off potential casual

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.179 
and would turn off potential casual

with<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.849> solo<00:03:04.120> shot<00:03:04.209> too<00:03:04.719> the<00:03:05.139> first<00:03:05.409> step<00:03:05.680> is

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
with a solo shot too the first step is

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.099 
with a solo shot too the first step is
to<00:03:06.040> attach<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.340> base<00:03:06.699> to<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> tripod<00:03:07.389> make

so is unusable for our use because of

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.600 
so is unusable for our use because of
the<00:05:43.120> jerky<00:05:43.540> motion<00:05:44.050> every<00:05:44.620> time<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:45.010> slow<00:05:45.340> down

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
the jerky motion every time I slow down

out<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.580> stop<00:05:48.850> and<00:05:49.150> we<00:05:49.570> get<00:05:49.750> this

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
out the stop and we get this
