00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
security when they wear off in about a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.920 
security when they wear off in about a
third<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.100> time<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.699> should<00:00:59.930> the

third the time that they should the
other<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:02.219> gonna<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> lot

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
other thing that you're gonna see a lot

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.469 
other thing that you're gonna see a lot
of<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.489> bargain<00:01:06.030> brake<00:01:06.240> job

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of out there is in a bargain brake job

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.670 
of out there is in a bargain brake job
or<00:01:06.600> where<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> pads<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> been<00:01:07.290> installed

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
or where the pads have been installed

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.830 
or where the pads have been installed
incorrectly<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.340> mean<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.479> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
incorrectly I mean you can see how this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
incorrectly I mean you can see how this
pad<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.770> levels<00:01:11.220> there's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> lip<00:01:11.790> there

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
pad has two levels there's a lip there

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
pad has two levels there's a lip there
there's<00:01:12.570> no<00:01:12.810> lip<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> starts<00:01:13.740> there

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there's no lip when it starts there

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.350 
there's no lip when it starts there
should<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.250> no<00:01:14.430> lip<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:14.970> finished

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
should be no lip what it's finished

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060 
should be no lip what it's finished
there's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> flat<00:01:15.840> pad<00:01:16.080> worn<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.680> no<00:01:16.830> lip

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there's a flat pad worn down with no lip

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
there's a flat pad worn down with no lip
this<00:01:17.520> lips<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this lips there and when you see the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.380 
this lips there and when you see the
rotor<00:01:19.140> over<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.280> isn't<00:01:20.759> exactly<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
rotor over here this isn't exactly the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
rotor over here this isn't exactly the
same<00:01:21.570> pad<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> similar<00:01:22.530> situation

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
same pad but it's a similar situation

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
same pad but it's a similar situation
where<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.460> use<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> wrong<00:01:23.939> size<00:01:24.299> brake<00:01:24.720> pad

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
where they use the wrong size brake pad

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.920 
where they use the wrong size brake pad
and<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.470> war<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:27.090> flush<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.600> part<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and so it war and was flush on part of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.620 
and so it war and was flush on part of
the<00:01:27.990> rotor<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.799> part<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> rotor

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the rotor and not on part of the rotor

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.760 
the rotor and not on part of the rotor
you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.380> other<00:01:31.470> used

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you know you can see some other used

surface is run smooth what we think
about<00:01:36.329> today<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:36.960> about<00:01:37.049> good

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
about today when we think about good

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.480 
about today when we think about good
brakes<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.860> think<00:01:37.979> about<00:01:38.070> something<00:01:38.400> called

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
brakes we think about something called

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
brakes we think about something called
ceramics<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.509> granted<00:01:39.869> these<00:01:40.020> bargains

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
ceramics now granted these bargains

joints<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.799> sell<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.729> called<00:01:41.939> ceramic

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
joints will sell you a so called ceramic

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.880 
joints will sell you a so called ceramic
pad<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.020> probably<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.380> mixture<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
pad but it's probably a mixture of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.289 
pad but it's probably a mixture of
metals<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.220> ceramics<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.090> it's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
metals and ceramics and if not it's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
metals and ceramics and if not it's
gonna<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> cheapest<00:01:46.049> possible<00:01:46.229> blend<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
ceramics in there again you're back to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.149 
ceramics in there again you're back to
something<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.470> valuable

different kinds of ceramic in them

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
different kinds of ceramic in them
they're<00:02:27.870> designed<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.380> stop<00:02:28.830> those<00:02:29.099> kind<00:02:29.340> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
they're designed to stop those kind of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
and we'll make Chris's noise go away the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.940 
and we'll make Chris's noise go away the
next<00:02:43.050> thing<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.230> want<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.440> talk<00:02:43.560> about<00:02:43.709> are<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
next thing I want to talk about are the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.309 
next thing I want to talk about are the
rotors<00:02:44.340> themselves<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.330> know<00:02:45.450> I've<00:02:45.959> got<00:02:46.140> some

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
rotors themselves you know I've got some

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.259 
rotors themselves you know I've got some
different<00:02:46.440> varieties<00:02:47.340> here<00:02:47.670> here's<00:02:48.000> one<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
different varieties here here's one that

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.759 
different varieties here here's one that
actually<00:02:48.390> came<00:02:48.720> apart<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.350> see<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
actually came apart you can see that the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.160 
actually came apart you can see that the
lug<00:02:49.980> parts<00:02:50.310> missing<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.970> center<00:02:51.299> it's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
lug parts missing in the center it's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.870 
lug parts missing in the center it's
again<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.830> cheap<00:02:53.100> rotor<00:02:53.400> that's<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:53.819> of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
again that's a cheap rotor that's one of

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.120 
again that's a cheap rotor that's one of
your<00:02:54.000> cheap<00:02:54.209> Chinese<00:02:54.660> jobs<00:02:55.049> somebody<00:02:55.890> got<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
your cheap Chinese jobs somebody got a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.920 
your cheap Chinese jobs somebody got a
good<00:02:56.400> deal<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.880> or<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.299> they<00:02:57.450> thought<00:02:57.690> until

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
good deal on it or so they thought until

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.570 
good deal on it or so they thought until
their<00:02:58.230> car<00:02:58.440> started<00:02:58.890> making<00:02:59.130> horrible<00:02:59.310> noise

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
their car started making horrible noise

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.370 
their car started making horrible noise
and<00:02:59.760> couldn't<00:02:59.970> go<00:03:00.060> anywhere<00:03:00.299> else<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.019> spend<00:03:01.319> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
and couldn't go anywhere else so spend a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.020 
and couldn't go anywhere else so spend a
little<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:01.709> money<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> quality<00:03:02.670> rotor

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
little more money get a quality rotor

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
little more money get a quality rotor
what<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.110> see<00:03:04.349> here<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.920> newest

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
what you see here are the newest

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.740 
what you see here are the newest
generation<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.970> rotors<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.480> these<00:03:06.599> are

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
generation of rotors and these are

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.009 
generation of rotors and these are
vented<00:03:07.349> in<00:03:07.530> order<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.400> allow<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.450> rotor<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
vented in order to allow the rotor to

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.680 
vented in order to allow the rotor to
cool<00:03:10.590> off<00:03:10.890> faster<00:03:11.310> sometimes<00:03:12.120> when<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.599> get

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
cool off faster sometimes when you get

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.089 
cool off faster sometimes when you get
in<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.870> car<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.230> step<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> brakes<00:03:13.890> and

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
in a car and you step on the brakes and

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.620 
in a car and you step on the brakes and
it<00:03:14.160> vibrates<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.970> feel<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.269> terrible

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it vibrates you feel that terrible

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.970 
it vibrates you feel that terrible
vibration<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.349> when<00:03:16.470> you're<00:03:16.590> braking

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
vibration just when you're braking

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.920 
vibration just when you're braking
that's<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.579> these<00:03:17.700> rotors<00:03:18.120> getting<00:03:18.450> too<00:03:18.660> hot

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
that's when these rotors getting too hot

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.050 
that's when these rotors getting too hot
and<00:03:19.200> starting<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.650> warp<00:03:19.890> or<00:03:20.160> bend<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
and starting to warp or bend and you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.430 
and starting to warp or bend and you
don't<00:03:21.239> have<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.359> nice<00:03:21.570> flat<00:03:21.780> surface<00:03:22.260> this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
don't have a nice flat surface this

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.130 
don't have a nice flat surface this
makes<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.190> cool<00:03:23.459> much<00:03:23.880> much<00:03:24.180> faster<00:03:24.450> it's

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
makes it cool much much faster it's

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.199 
makes it cool much much faster it's
gonna<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.620> gonna<00:03:25.739> not<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.579> vibration

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
gonna it's gonna not have that vibration

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.780 
gonna it's gonna not have that vibration
problem<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.620> biggest<00:03:29.010> thing<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.340> tell<00:03:29.640> you

problem the biggest thing I can tell you
about<00:03:29.880> brake<00:03:30.209> jobs<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.200> anything

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
about brake jobs is it's like anything

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.080 
about brake jobs is it's like anything
else<00:03:31.799> your<00:03:32.010> parents<00:03:32.040> told<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.579> about<00:03:32.790> if<00:03:32.970> it
