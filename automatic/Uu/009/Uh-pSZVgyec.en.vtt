malfunctioning fridge and as you can see

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.419 
malfunctioning fridge and as you can see
I've<00:00:08.389> pretty<00:00:09.389> much<00:00:09.480> pulled<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.019> bits

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
I've pretty much pulled it all the bits

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.220 
I've pretty much pulled it all the bits
now<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.910> can't<00:00:12.360> find<00:00:12.509> anything<00:00:12.780> obviously

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

blown<00:00:13.469> I've<00:00:13.769> had<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> top<00:00:14.250> off<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.660> capacitor

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
blown I've had the top off the capacitor

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.349 
blown I've had the top off the capacitor
and<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.379> looks<00:00:16.980> perfectly<00:00:17.430> fine<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.910> tests

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
and that looks perfectly fine and tests

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.060 
and that looks perfectly fine and tests
fine<00:00:20.029> I've<00:00:21.029> used<00:00:21.359> my<00:00:21.510> ESR<00:00:22.050> meter<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.680> tests

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
fine I've used my ESR meter and it tests

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.660 
fine I've used my ESR meter and it tests
fine

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
fine

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070 
fine
there<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.000> no<00:00:24.240> burning<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.750> doesn't<00:00:24.960> even

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
there is no burning it doesn't even

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
there is no burning it doesn't even
smell<00:00:25.410> burnt<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.279> fully<00:00:26.580> potted<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.119> resin

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
smell burnt it's fully potted in resin

smell burnt it's fully potted in resin
there's<00:00:28.140> no<00:00:28.650> way<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:28.890> any<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> smoke<00:00:30.090> or

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
just concluded top back on that I've

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
just concluded top back on that I've
even<00:00:36.930> popped<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.410> tougher<00:00:38.309> plate<00:00:38.610> off

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
even popped a little tougher plate off

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.209 
even popped a little tougher plate off
the<00:00:38.850> thermal<00:00:39.840> switch<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.530> arced<00:00:40.829> over

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the thermal switch that's not arced over

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.680 
the thermal switch that's not arced over
or<00:00:41.399> burnt<00:00:41.670> I've<00:00:41.910> seen<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> blown<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> pieces

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
or burnt I've seen this blown to pieces

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.200 
or burnt I've seen this blown to pieces
by<00:00:43.290> failing<00:00:44.040> compressors<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:44.969> thing<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
by failing compressors but this thing is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.290 
by failing compressors but this thing is
perfectly<00:00:45.719> fine<00:00:46.640> compressor<00:00:47.640> also<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.210> up

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
perfectly fine compressor also I was up

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.190 
perfectly fine compressor also I was up
fine<00:00:48.539> there's<00:00:48.750> nothing<00:00:48.930> wrong<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
fine there's nothing wrong with that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.830 
fine there's nothing wrong with that
it's<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> full<00:00:50.370> charge<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.600> works

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it's got a full charge in it it works

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.580 
it's got a full charge in it it works
fine<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.260> runs<00:00:52.440> fine<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.690> just<00:00:54.690> don't<00:00:54.989> know<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
fine it runs fine I just don't know I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
fine it runs fine I just don't know I
mean<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:57.149> certain<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
mean they're certain that there was a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
mean they're certain that there was a
horrible<00:00:58.469> smelling<00:00:58.859> smoke<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> few<00:01:00.090> bangs

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
horrible smelling smoke and a few bangs

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.139 
horrible smelling smoke and a few bangs
coming<00:01:00.690> from<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> fridge<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> go

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
coming from the fridge I'm going to go

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
coming from the fridge I'm going to go
and<00:01:03.270> look<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> power<00:01:04.260> outlets<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.070> confirm

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and look at the power outlets to confirm

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.840 
and look at the power outlets to confirm
that's<00:01:05.909> okay<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> imagine<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.159> arc<00:01:08.369> over<00:01:08.610> in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that's okay but I imagine an arc over in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.039 
that's okay but I imagine an arc over in
the<00:01:08.939> power<00:01:09.210> outlet<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.810> tripped

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the power outlet would have tripped

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950 
the power outlet would have tripped
either<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.000> ground<00:01:12.000> leakage<00:01:12.479> earth<00:01:12.689> leakage

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
either the ground leakage earth leakage

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.399 
either the ground leakage earth leakage
breaker<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> main<00:01:14.900> RC<00:01:15.900> or<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> main

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
breaker or the main RC or the main

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.740 
breaker or the main RC or the main
circuit<00:01:16.770> breaker<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.470> unusual

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
circuit breaker so it's really unusual

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
circuit breaker so it's really unusual
but<00:01:22.880> before<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:24.960> run<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but before I do that I'm gonna run it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.170 
but before I do that I'm gonna run it
I'm<00:01:25.920> gonna<00:01:26.070> pull<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> fan<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.030> check

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I'm gonna pull that fan out and check

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.100 
I'm gonna pull that fan out and check
that<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:29.490> run<00:01:29.700> 24<00:01:30.180> hours<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that it's run 24 hours and I think the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.649 
that it's run 24 hours and I think the
defrost<00:01:31.560> timer<00:01:31.680> goes<00:01:32.100> every<00:01:32.400> 24<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.479> does

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
defrost timer goes every 24 and it does

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.050 
defrost timer goes every 24 and it does
run<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> mechanical<00:01:34.409> defrost<00:01:34.890> timer<00:01:35.000> now<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
run a mechanical defrost timer now the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.679 
run a mechanical defrost timer now the
only<00:01:36.270> unusual<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> found<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
only unusual thing I found was that a

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.350 
only unusual thing I found was that a
little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.140> paper<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:41.640> also<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:42.030> fire

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
little bit of paper it's also some fire

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.249 
little bit of paper it's also some fire
in<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:45.020> really<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
in there I really don't know so a bit of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
in there I really don't know so a bit of
paper<00:01:49.470> towel<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.070> something<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.460> wonder<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
paper towel or something I wonder if it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.179 
paper towel or something I wonder if it
got<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.149> into<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:53.270> defrost<00:01:54.270> element<00:01:54.750> perhaps

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
got up into the defrost element perhaps

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.209 
got up into the defrost element perhaps
got<00:01:56.189> blown<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.850> by<00:01:57.000> an<00:01:57.869> Airstream<00:01:58.680> got

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
got blown in there by an Airstream got

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.830 
got blown in there by an Airstream got
stuck<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> defrost<00:02:00.090> element<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> just

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
stuck to the defrost element and just

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.160 
stuck to the defrost element and just
burnt<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.750> think<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> wouldn't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
burnt a little bit I think that wouldn't

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
burnt a little bit I think that wouldn't
be<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> though<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:05.820> doesn't<00:02:06.060> even<00:02:06.119> look<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
be it though it doesn't even look like a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940 
be it though it doesn't even look like a
label<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> bit<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> paper<00:02:07.350> towel<00:02:07.710> from

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
label it's a bit of paper towel from

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.230 
label it's a bit of paper towel from
cleaning<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> thing<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.500> happen

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
cleaning the thing so that can happen

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.510 
cleaning the thing so that can happen
then<00:02:13.240> there's<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.200> ice<00:02:15.210> sensor<00:02:16.770> ground<00:02:17.770> halting

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
then there's a ice sensor ground halting

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.360 
then there's a ice sensor ground halting
is<00:02:18.640> grounded<00:02:19.120> with<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.270> metal<00:02:19.540> casing<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> any

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
is grounded with a metal casing so any

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.250 
is grounded with a metal casing so any
shorting<00:02:21.940> here<00:02:22.180> would<00:02:22.330> trip<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> RCD<00:02:24.000> element

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
shorting here would trip the RCD element

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.730 
shorting here would trip the RCD element
there's<00:02:26.260> another<00:02:26.680> sensor<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:28.740> there's

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
there's another sensor I think there's

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.500 
there's another sensor I think there's
two<00:02:29.980> sensors<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.580> an<00:02:30.670> icing<00:02:31.000> sensor<00:02:31.420> in

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
two sensors as an icing sensor in

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.940 
two sensors as an icing sensor in
there's<00:02:31.690> probably<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.990> defrost<00:02:32.440> on

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
there's probably a defrost on

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670 
there's probably a defrost on
no<00:02:33.700> sorry<00:02:33.970> that's<00:02:34.000> defrost<00:02:34.720> element<00:02:35.290> one

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
no sorry that's defrost element one

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.150 
no sorry that's defrost element one
icing<00:02:36.070> sensor<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:37.150> fan<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> I'll<00:02:38.709> pull

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
icing sensor and one fan so I'll pull

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.449 
icing sensor and one fan so I'll pull
that<00:02:39.190> out<00:02:39.520> make<00:02:39.730> sure<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.000> works<00:02:41.340> actually<00:02:42.340> no

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
that out make sure it works actually no

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.830 
that out make sure it works actually no
I'll<00:02:42.580> put<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> plug<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.090> anything<00:02:43.390> back<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.690> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
I'll put a plug of anything back in and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.460 
I'll put a plug of anything back in and
power<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.080> up<00:02:44.430> that's<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:46.260> interior<00:02:47.260> light

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
power it up that's just interior light

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.010 
power it up that's just interior light
which<00:02:47.709> works

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
which works

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.430 
which works
that's<00:02:50.020> defrost<00:02:50.830> timer<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> thermostat

that's defrost timer and the thermostat

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.050 
that's defrost timer and the thermostat
control<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.980> everything's<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.489> shed<00:02:57.760> I'm

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
control and everything's in the shed I'm

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.090 
control and everything's in the shed I'm
gonna<00:02:58.239> try<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.870> separate<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.380> foam<00:02:59.590> housing

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
gonna try and separate the foam housing

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.080 
gonna try and separate the foam housing
and<00:03:00.250> expose<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.000> thermostat<00:03:01.540> housing

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
and expose the thermostat housing

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.600 
and expose the thermostat housing
this<00:03:04.090> thing's<00:03:04.270> weird<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:05.100> don't<00:03:06.100> know<00:03:06.280> maybe

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
rough shape at the moment so I'm trying

I've<00:03:27.820> already<00:03:27.910> bought<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.209> new<00:03:28.330> fridge<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.250> if

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
I've already bought a new fridge so if

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.500 
I've already bought a new fridge so if
the<00:03:30.400> same<00:03:30.580> sort<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.820> thing<00:03:30.970> happens<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the same sort of thing happens to the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.690 
the same sort of thing happens to the
new<00:03:31.660> fridge<00:03:31.989> well<00:03:32.640> who<00:03:33.640> knows<00:03:35.340> okay<00:03:36.340> well

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
new fridge well who knows okay well

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.539 
new fridge well who knows okay well
that's<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:38.670> interior<00:03:39.670> panel<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.459> to

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
that's the interior panel I just have to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.009 
that's the interior panel I just have to
try<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.820> separate<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.269> foam<00:03:43.570> thing<00:03:43.840> which<00:03:43.959> I

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
try and separate this foam thing which I

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.259 
try and separate this foam thing which I
got<00:03:44.170> currently<00:03:44.590> done<00:03:44.829> but<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.100> think<00:03:45.340> that

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
got currently done but I think that

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.090 
got currently done but I think that
little<00:03:46.510> spindle<00:03:47.140> there<00:03:47.260> has<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.440> clip<00:03:47.769> through

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
little spindle there has to clip through

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.080 
little spindle there has to clip through
and<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.340> whole<00:03:48.519> lot<00:03:48.700> should<00:03:48.850> pull<00:03:49.060> out

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
and the whole lot should pull out

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.380 
and the whole lot should pull out
because<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.630> operates<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.739> baffle<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
because that operates a baffle and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.560 
because that operates a baffle and
they're<00:03:52.570> shut<00:03:52.870> off<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.650> can<00:03:54.329> control<00:03:55.329> the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
they're shut off so you can control the

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.560 
they're shut off so you can control the
air<00:03:55.720> coming<00:03:55.959> from<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.230> freezer<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:56.890> your<00:03:57.570> food

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
air coming from the freezer so your food

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.090 
air coming from the freezer so your food
temperatures<00:03:59.170> buried<00:03:59.680> well<00:04:00.610> actually<00:04:00.730> no

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
it off the more the cold of the phrase

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
and I know it was working desired the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.650 
and I know it was working desired the
fridge<00:04:35.570> running<00:04:35.900> at<00:04:35.990> least<00:04:36.110> 24<00:04:36.650> hours<00:04:37.100> and

there<00:04:38.660> was<00:04:38.750> absolutely<00:04:38.990> no<00:04:39.470> issue<00:04:39.650> with<00:04:39.889> it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
there was absolutely no issue with it

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.940 
there was absolutely no issue with it
switching<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.669> off<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:42.230> I'm<00:04:42.650> gonna<00:04:42.800> put

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
switching on and off so I'm gonna put

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.900 
switching on and off so I'm gonna put
this<00:04:43.010> back<00:04:43.070> together<00:04:43.310> again

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
this back together again

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.480 
this back together again
put<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.120> all<00:04:44.210> in<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:45.100> turn<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.190> power<00:04:46.400> on

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
super fan works I believe it was working

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.730 
super fan works I believe it was working
I<00:04:49.520> mean<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.270> would<00:04:50.750> feel<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.110> airflow<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.470> don't

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
I mean I would feel the airflow I don't

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.490 
I mean I would feel the airflow I don't
know<00:04:51.800> whether<00:04:51.889> that<00:04:52.010> was<00:04:52.250> just<00:04:52.460> through<00:04:52.730> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
know whether that was just through the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.900 
know whether that was just through the
cold<00:04:54.500> air<00:04:54.680> falling<00:04:55.040> and<00:04:55.370> drawing<00:04:55.730> here

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
cold air falling and drawing here

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.820 
cold air falling and drawing here
through<00:04:56.240> or<00:04:56.480> whether<00:04:56.720> it<00:04:56.870> was<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.620> fan

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
through or whether it was the fan

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:25.300 
through or whether it was the fan
working<00:04:58.340> but<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:59.389> should<00:04:59.600> be<00:05:00.910> well<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.030> fine

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.800 

yeah<00:05:26.180> surprising

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.440 

I<00:05:32.220> really<00:05:33.220> don't<00:05:33.370> know<00:05:33.610> what's<00:05:33.820> going<00:05:34.030> on<00:05:34.180> here

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
I really don't know what's going on here

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.790 
I really don't know what's going on here
and<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:35.050> think<00:05:35.080> there's<00:05:35.380> anything<00:05:35.560> wrong<00:05:35.740> with

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
and I think there's anything wrong with

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:44.000 
and I think there's anything wrong with
this<00:05:36.040> fridge<00:05:39.150> seems<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.240> be<00:05:40.330> doing<00:05:40.480> its<00:05:40.570> job

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.750 

stay<00:05:45.010> frosty

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.510 

no<00:05:49.230> let<00:05:50.230> it<00:05:50.350> run<00:05:50.500> put<00:05:51.160> it<00:05:51.250> back<00:05:51.370> together

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
no let it run put it back together

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.230 
no let it run put it back together
properly<00:05:51.790> and<00:05:52.150> then<00:05:52.240> let<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.419> run<00:05:52.630> anyway<00:05:53.020> I

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
properly and then let it run anyway I

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.920 
properly and then let it run anyway I
don't<00:05:55.240> think<00:05:55.360> there's<00:05:55.480> anything<00:05:55.660> wrong<00:05:55.780> with

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
don't think there's anything wrong with

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.180 
don't think there's anything wrong with
it<00:05:57.540> la<00:05:58.540> it's<00:05:58.690> not<00:05:58.720> electrically<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.889> fault

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
it la it's not electrically that fault

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:12.630 
it la it's not electrically that fault
anything<00:06:09.990> that's<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.140> rota<00:06:11.410> for<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:11.770> defrost

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
anything that's the rota for the defrost

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.340 
anything that's the rota for the defrost
timer<00:06:15.330> anyway<00:06:16.330> thanks<00:06:16.810> for<00:06:16.870> watching

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.690 

okay<00:06:20.350> well<00:06:20.530> final<00:06:20.950> conclusion<00:06:21.580> on<00:06:21.640> that

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
okay well final conclusion on that

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.700 
okay well final conclusion on that
fridge<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:23.169> I<00:06:23.200> could<00:06:23.410> come<00:06:23.590> up<00:06:23.620> with

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
fridge that I could come up with

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.230 
fridge that I could come up with
especially<00:06:24.100> after<00:06:24.580> talking<00:06:24.820> to<00:06:25.030> Mum

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
especially after talking to Mum

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.530 
especially after talking to Mum
she<00:06:28.240> nan<00:06:28.960> probably<00:06:29.910> heard<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.150> sound<00:06:31.389> of<00:06:31.479> a

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
she nan probably heard the sound of a

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.650 
she nan probably heard the sound of a
defrosting<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:33.370> smell<00:06:33.700> was<00:06:34.060> that<00:06:34.419> piece

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
defrosting and the smell was that piece

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.719 
defrosting and the smell was that piece
of<00:06:34.870> paper<00:06:35.110> towel<00:06:35.530> that<00:06:35.890> ended<00:06:36.340> up<00:06:36.460> on<00:06:36.640> the

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
of paper towel that ended up on the

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.219 
of paper towel that ended up on the
defrost<00:06:37.120> element<00:06:38.729> she<00:06:39.729> we<00:06:40.630> don't<00:06:40.840> believe<00:06:41.080> she

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
defrost element she we don't believe she

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.260 
defrost element she we don't believe she
actually<00:06:41.320> saw<00:06:41.770> smoke<00:06:42.160> it<00:06:42.370> just<00:06:42.550> smelt<00:06:42.850> kind<00:06:43.150> of

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
actually saw smoke it just smelt kind of

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.810 
actually saw smoke it just smelt kind of
nasty<00:06:43.479> and<00:06:43.840> since<00:06:44.410> that<00:06:44.590> fan<00:06:45.190> compartment

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
nasty and since that fan compartment

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.600 
nasty and since that fan compartment
also<00:06:45.940> vents<00:06:46.510> a<00:06:46.600> bit<00:06:46.750> of<00:06:46.870> air<00:06:47.229> out<00:06:48.039> the<00:06:48.280> back<00:06:48.460> of

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
also vents a bit of air out the back of

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.230 
also vents a bit of air out the back of
the<00:06:48.700> fridge<00:06:48.940> with<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.860> condensate<00:06:51.240> it's

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
the fridge with the condensate it's

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.500 
the fridge with the condensate it's
probably<00:06:52.750> where<00:06:52.900> the<00:06:53.020> smell<00:06:53.260> came<00:06:53.500> from<00:06:53.830> so

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
probably where the smell came from so

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.080 
probably where the smell came from so
yeah<00:06:56.010> anyway<00:06:57.010> fridges<00:06:57.370> back<00:06:57.550> together<00:06:57.700> and

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
yeah anyway fridges back together and

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.630 
yeah anyway fridges back together and
running<00:06:58.270> again<00:06:58.479> so<00:06:58.990> I'll<00:06:59.950> give<00:07:00.130> it<00:07:00.220> a<00:07:00.280> few<00:07:00.430> days

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
running again so I'll give it a few days

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.159 
running again so I'll give it a few days
let<00:07:01.000> it<00:07:01.090> cycle<00:07:01.330> on<00:07:01.570> and<00:07:01.690> off<00:07:01.810> through<00:07:02.050> the

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
defrost cycle a few times and just see

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.350 
defrost cycle a few times and just see
what<00:07:05.080> happens<00:07:05.520> if<00:07:06.520> any<00:07:06.669> nothing<00:07:07.090> stupid

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
unfortunate bit of paper that ended up

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.260 
unfortunate bit of paper that ended up
on<00:07:12.490> the<00:07:12.640> defrost<00:07:13.090> element<00:07:13.570> and<00:07:14.070> burnt<00:07:15.270> because

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
on the defrost element and burnt because

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.880 
on the defrost element and burnt because
it<00:07:16.510> was<00:07:16.630> fairly<00:07:16.810> well<00:07:17.050> singed<00:07:17.530> as<00:07:17.650> you<00:07:17.770> could

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
it was fairly well singed as you could

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.440 
it was fairly well singed as you could
see<00:07:18.130> the<00:07:18.310> edges<00:07:18.550> were<00:07:18.669> black<00:07:18.940> and<00:07:19.180> who<00:07:19.270> knows

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
see the edges were black and who knows

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.600 
see the edges were black and who knows
what<00:07:19.690> else<00:07:19.720> how<00:07:20.320> big<00:07:20.560> it<00:07:20.710> was<00:07:20.830> to<00:07:21.039> begin<00:07:21.190> with

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
what else how big it was to begin with

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.330 
what else how big it was to begin with
so<00:07:22.360> you<00:07:22.419> could<00:07:22.600> imagine<00:07:22.690> like<00:07:23.140> a<00:07:23.169> 5<00:07:23.830> cent<00:07:24.070> piece

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
so you could imagine like a 5 cent piece

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.880 
so you could imagine like a 5 cent piece
size<00:07:25.240> piece<00:07:25.660> of<00:07:25.810> paper<00:07:26.020> burning<00:07:26.500> away<00:07:26.590> on<00:07:26.860> a

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.890 
size piece of paper burning away on a

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.520 
size piece of paper burning away on a
heating<00:07:27.520> element<00:07:27.810> creative<00:07:28.810> theory<00:07:29.320> about<00:07:29.410> a

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
heating element creative theory about a

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.380 
heating element creative theory about a
smoke<00:07:29.919> and<00:07:30.160> smell<00:07:30.550> especially<00:07:31.120> when<00:07:31.240> it's

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.390 
smoke and smell especially when it's

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.210 
smoke and smell especially when it's
fan-forced

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
fan-forced

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.640 
fan-forced
so<00:07:33.220> I<00:07:33.669> gotta<00:07:34.479> say<00:07:34.810> I<00:07:34.840> understand<00:07:35.320> combined

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650 
so I gotta say I understand combined

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.409 
so I gotta say I understand combined
with<00:07:35.800> the<00:07:35.890> banging<00:07:36.250> of<00:07:36.340> the<00:07:36.490> ice<00:07:36.669> breaking<00:07:37.270> up

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
with the banging of the ice breaking up

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.810 
with the banging of the ice breaking up
that<00:07:37.690> would<00:07:38.440> be<00:07:38.470> quite<00:07:38.710> unnerving<00:07:39.130> to<00:07:39.370> wake<00:07:39.610> up

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:39.820 
that would be quite unnerving to wake up

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.450 
that would be quite unnerving to wake up
to<00:07:40.000> in<00:07:40.120> the<00:07:40.180> middle<00:07:40.330> of<00:07:40.450> the<00:07:40.570> night<00:07:40.720> so<00:07:41.460> yeah

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.460 
to in the middle of the night so yeah

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.300 
to in the middle of the night so yeah
maybe<00:07:42.760> that's<00:07:43.030> all<00:07:43.180> it<00:07:43.300> is<00:07:43.560> anyway<00:07:44.560> it

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310 
maybe that's all it is anyway it

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.730 
maybe that's all it is anyway it
sting<00:07:45.550> a<00:07:45.580> little<00:07:46.030> interesting<00:07:46.990> little<00:07:47.200> quest

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:47.740 
sting a little interesting little quest

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.260 
sting a little interesting little quest
to<00:07:47.920> find<00:07:48.100> a<00:07:48.220> fault<00:07:48.460> I'll<00:07:48.730> give<00:07:48.850> it<00:07:48.940> that<00:07:48.970> much

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.270 
to find a fault I'll give it that much

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.560 
to find a fault I'll give it that much
thanks<00:07:50.140> for<00:07:50.260> watching
