this<00:02:18.660> has<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.080> tanky<00:02:19.440> Garchomp<00:02:19.890> no<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
this has to be a tanky Garchomp no it is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630 
this has to be a tanky Garchomp no it is
not<00:02:21.150> apparently<00:02:21.600> I'm<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.590> did<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.370> didn't

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
not apparently I'm like I did I didn't

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800 
expect you know that to survive so well
what<00:02:26.280> yeah<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.420> actually<00:02:27.780> very

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
what yeah that's actually very

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.370 
what yeah that's actually very
surprising<00:02:28.590> even<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.820> helping<00:02:30.120> hand<00:02:30.450> my

surprising even with the helping hand my

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.280 
surprising even with the helping hand my
goodness<00:02:32.360> feel<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.450> earthquake<00:02:33.930> could<00:02:34.200> have

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
goodness feel like earthquake could have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.080 
goodness feel like earthquake could have
been<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> better<00:02:34.650> idea<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> try<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> get

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
been a better idea just to try to get

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.400 
been a better idea just to try to get
the<00:02:36.210> double<00:02:36.510> spread<00:02:36.870> onto<00:02:37.700> hitmontop<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:39.060> well

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
the double spread onto hitmontop as well

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.800 
the double spread onto hitmontop as well
and<00:02:40.410> hitmontop<00:02:41.190> switches<00:02:42.000> back<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.420> from<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and hitmontop switches back in from the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
and hitmontop switches back in from the
last<00:02:42.990> turn<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.350> goes<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.980> fake-out<00:02:44.460> gets

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
last turn it goes for the fake-out gets

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.380 
last turn it goes for the fake-out gets
flame<00:02:45.510> bodied<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.640> again<00:02:47.640> now<00:02:47.910> we're<00:02:48.120> trying

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
flame bodied and again now we're trying

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.710 
flame bodied and again now we're trying
to<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.570> some<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:49.050> icy<00:02:49.530> wind<00:02:49.770> down<00:02:50.450> yeah<00:02:51.450> this

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
to get some more icy wind down yeah this

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.050 
to get some more icy wind down yeah this
cresselia<00:02:52.170> has<00:02:52.380> no<00:02:52.740> damage<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.610> icy<00:02:53.880> wind

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
cresselia has no damage so the icy wind

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.290 
cresselia has no damage so the icy wind
didn't<00:02:54.450> even<00:02:54.870> affect<00:02:55.830> Gardevoir<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:56.880> all<00:02:56.970> just

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
damage that was a good prediction right

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.719 
damage that was a good prediction right
there<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.650> can<00:05:43.889> see<00:05:43.919> what<00:05:44.220> he<00:05:44.280> was<00:05:44.400> talking

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
there I can see what he was talking

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.700 
there I can see what he was talking
about<00:05:44.789> you<00:05:45.030> know<00:05:45.150> it's<00:05:45.960> easy<00:05:46.139> to<00:05:46.289> take<00:05:46.530> the

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
about you know it's easy to take the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.700 
about you know it's easy to take the
brute<00:05:47.460> force<00:05:47.760> play<00:05:48.000> but<00:05:48.810> now<00:05:48.960> greninja<00:05:49.470> is

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
brute force play but now greninja is

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.680 
brute force play but now greninja is
paralyzed<00:05:50.250> so<00:05:50.460> it's<00:05:50.639> most<00:05:50.970> likely<00:05:51.060> going<00:05:51.419> to

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
paralyzed so it's most likely going to

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.010 
paralyzed so it's most likely going to
be<00:05:51.750> going<00:05:51.930> second<00:05:53.300> except<00:05:54.300> for<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.570> shadow

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
be going second except for the shadow

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.480 
be going second except for the shadow
sneak<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.820> wow<00:05:57.410> that<00:05:58.410> was<00:05:58.680> incredibly

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
sneak and wow that was incredibly

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.779 
sneak and wow that was incredibly
surprising<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.300> opponent<00:06:01.080> forfeited<00:06:01.470> of<00:06:01.950> all

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
surprising the opponent forfeited of all

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.040 
surprising the opponent forfeited of all
things<00:06:03.120> so<00:06:03.360> I'm<00:06:03.419> trying<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.690> figure<00:06:03.810> out<00:06:03.990> how

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
things so I'm trying to figure out how

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.870
