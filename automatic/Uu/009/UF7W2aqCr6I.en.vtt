gender<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:40.080> um<00:03:40.320> yeah<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.580> they<00:03:41.820> goes<00:03:42.030> up<00:03:42.150> to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
gender but um yeah so they goes up to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.840 
gender but um yeah so they goes up to
their<00:03:42.360> full<00:03:42.390> size<00:03:43.100> now<00:03:44.100> something<00:03:44.460> else<00:03:44.610> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
their full size now something else you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.970 
their full size now something else you
can<00:03:44.880> do<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.480> make<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.960> lead<00:03:46.350> now<00:03:46.800> this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
can do is you can make a lead now this

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.880 
can do is you can make a lead now this
is<00:03:47.040> done<00:03:47.340> by<00:03:47.580> using<00:03:48.000> string<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.840> slime<00:03:49.560> that

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
is done by using string and slime that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.440

two blocks or 11 block or two block of
water<00:04:50.070> but<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.460> get<00:04:50.640> it<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.330> three

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
water but if you get it on to three

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
blocks of water he will fall off and the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.160 
blocks of water he will fall off and the
only<00:04:53.820> way<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.180> get<00:04:54.360> him<00:04:54.420> out<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.690> water<00:04:54.900> is

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
on the hay bale because they are a block

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.610 
on the hay bale because they are a block
and<00:05:26.760> then<00:05:27.240> they<00:05:27.420> can<00:05:27.600> potentially<00:05:27.900> jump<00:05:28.380> out

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
and then they can potentially jump out

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.650 
and then they can potentially jump out
of<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.920> pen<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:30.150> is<00:05:30.330> another<00:05:30.540> reason

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
of the pen and that is another reason

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.730 
of the pen and that is another reason
why<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.080> built<00:05:31.980> my<00:05:32.660> advanced<00:05:33.660> for<00:05:34.020> spin<00:05:34.320> as<00:05:34.530> you

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
why I built my advanced for spin as you

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.710 
why I built my advanced for spin as you
saw<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.850> right<00:05:36.000> over<00:05:36.150> there<00:05:36.390> and

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.020 
saw to the to the right over there and
that<00:05:37.470> will<00:05:37.740> keep<00:05:37.920> them<00:05:38.100> in<00:05:38.280> there<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.640> again

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
that will keep them in there and I again

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.020
