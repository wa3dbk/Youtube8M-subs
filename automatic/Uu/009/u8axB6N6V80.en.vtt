00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 in our stitch we will work 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.890
 a central braid that is going to be multiple 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.250
 of six points with backhand points in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 the edges and we're going to add one 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 braid simulating this braid will simulate the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.170
 let's work in the spaces 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.949
 marked as a little star that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.550
 is equivalent to working three points together and 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:45.930
 without removing the needle we will knit a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.240
 right a setback and a right let's 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.180
 see how we do it 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.980
 let's start here we have a point of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.290
 shore that in the most graphic does not have 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.430
 value here I have it because it is a 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.450
 panel we are going to weave the first point of the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.490
 reverse 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.580
 the white point with the white space 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.960
 that is pointed out that has no value 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.960
 it's because we're going to take 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.750
 three points right points 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.900
 and without letting go of the needle 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.900
 together we take 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.790
 the reverse point by raising the thread 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 we take the three points together 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.200
 without dropping the points of any of the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.400
 two needles go back to pass the needle 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.430
 towards the back and we weave 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.120
 again 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.200
 a right here are the three points 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.200
 we get out of the three points together 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.420
 is what will give us the opportunity to form a 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.880
 simulate braid 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.590
 you are going to see that you have the points 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.229
 fastened that would come to be the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.190
 equivalent of cross points now 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.420
 we work 1 2 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.510
 three times 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.700
 and we get to the point where we have the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.740
 panel of the right points that are going to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.930
 form the braid 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.680
 is a braid that we are going to cross with the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 points left on hold by the front 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:36.720
 of the fabric again to our cover 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:38.520
 auxiliary points we weave 123 rights 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.560
 We passed the needle lightly to the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.540
 left and we weave the points that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.540
 we have on hold too 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.980
 now we continue knitting our three 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.069
 backhand points 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.200
 and again 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.999
 we find the three points of 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.790
 right remember we are working 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:03.790
 the third round then we take 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.069
 three points together 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.290
 without letting go of the water 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.160
 we take these points together with a point 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.480
 of right we raise the thread 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.480
 and we are going to work now 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.680
 three times 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.540
 without dropping points we return the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.750
 strand back and we will work 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.720
 a right 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.420
 and we let the points end 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.209
 weaving 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.780
 our point the other way around and the point of 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.330
 origin 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.230
 you are going to see here 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.230
 that we already have 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.520
 the little star that was the points 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.380
 that we take together at both ends and 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:59.370
 the crossing of the braid 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.549
 in the center we will continue weaving 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.170
 our eight rounds of 10 years is a 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.209
 of right in which a reason returns 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.380
 the right all the laps where 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.110
 we will have them as the points mark 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.030
 well we continued knitting and the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.970
 point where we do not have to cross 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.120
 again 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.700
 and take our points together 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.550
 we do this again as we did 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.500
 in the previous steps three together with 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.920
 where right 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.850
 we put the thread up 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.850
 point of the reverse 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.030
 we return the thread 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.020
 and now we are going to work 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.129
 a point 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.679
 from right 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.939
 here we will be able to observe since it 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:53.919
 are forming the three appointments or the 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:56.259
 stars how are you going to find 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.059
 inside the chart but they are three to 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.039
 simulated because it is a holding 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.800
 simulated because it has no crossing 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.929
 points and they are names here are three 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.300
 points then nothing else the only thing 

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:09.399
 is doing the kind is the work of 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.249
 take the three points together and go back to 

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:14.460
 take three points from the same place 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:17.419
 we continue weaving 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.419
 three setbacks 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.729
 and we make our point crossing 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.420
 one 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.370
 23 we leave on hold 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.440
 I recommend that when they work 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.580
 all your complete work at the time of 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.260
 have the waiting points turn on the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.960
 auxiliary needle to avoid being 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.210
 does and therefore may cause some 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:51.110
 loss of some point 1 2 3 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.990
 let go of the needle 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.870
 accommodating the points 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.800
 and we make them available 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.800
 to weave 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.590
 two 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.980
 then here we are going to see that we already have 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.870
 complete the figure as seen in 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.870
 our garment the central braid 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.340
 backhand points on the sides and 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:27.480
 little stars or simulated braids 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.580
 on the sides of the backhand points 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.800
 leave is written in agreement as you 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.420
 indicates the graph until the size 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.420
 necessary to adjust your piece
